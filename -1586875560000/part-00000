It is on the south bank of the [[Geum River]] just upstream from its exit into the [[Yellow Sea]]. It has emerged as a high-tech manufacturing industrial city and an international trade seaport that is approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Seoul on the midwest coast of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]] is in the city. To encourage investment, a free trade zone has been declared in the area.\n\nNotable residents of Gunsan include actress [[Lee Eun-ju]], comedian [[Park Myeong-su]], and [[Teen Top]] member L.Joe. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Kunsan air base with F-16s.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kunsan Air Base]]]]\n\nGunsan was a small fishing village on the banks of the Geum River, near where the river spills into the Yellow Sea. It sits on the fertile western ''Honam'' plain where much rice is harvested. Gunsan became a port in the late 19th century largely due to pressure from the Japanese on the Koreans to ship rice to [[Japan]]. In 1899, Gunsan Port officially opened up to international trade. Gunsan City was largely settled by Japanese during the period of the Japanese occupation. The old (now demolished) City Hall and the Customs House are of Japanese construction. After liberation from the Japanese in 1945, Gunsan began to grow slowly.\n\nThe [[Korean War]] of the 1950s left the Gunsan area relatively unscathed. The initial drive south by the Communist North Koreans pushed the [[United Nations]] and South Korean forces toward [[Busan]] so quickly that Gunsan was spared from protracted fighting.\n\nNevertheless, a battalion of [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Korean Marines]], entrenched in the hills above Gunsan Port, withheld overwhelming communist forces. Their bravery created extra time for the evacuation of the town and port. The action is commemorated with a monument on the ridgeline where the heaviest fighting occurred. ({{coord|35|59|26|N|126|42|16|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:KR-45|name=(monument)}})\n\nThe drive north by the United Nations forces occurred so rapidly that there was little direct confrontation in the area. After the cessation of hostilities, the [[United States Air Force]] occupied nearby Kunsan Air Base, which has affected Gunsan City.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] was originally constructed, under Japanese direction, by reclaiming mudflats starting in about 1923. Kunsan Air Base has hosted a variety of USAF combat aircraft. The proximity of US service members to Gunsan City has provided some economic growth to Gunsan City, but the base's influence has waned since the 1990s as a result of a more powerful and diversified Korean economy. The downtown shopping districts that catered to US troops have transformed into areas that are indistinguishable from surrounding areas that serve Korean shoppers. Only a few remaining stores hint at the area's previous manifestation as an American shopping district. The small Okku-Silver Town (or more popularly America Town) caters to US troops. About {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} from the main gate of Kunsan Air Base, America Town hosts bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops.\n\n==Economy==\nToday, Gunsan's economy thrives on fishing, agriculture and heavy industry west of the city in the reclaimed area known as the Industrial Zone. [[GM Korea]] operates a factory here that assembles the [[Chevrolet Aveo]] worldwide and as the [[Holden Barina]] in Australia and New Zealand. Near the port, the [[Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle]] factory produces Daewoo trucks for the domestic and export markets. In the domestic market vehicles are sold under Daewoo brand; the [[Tata Group|Tata]] brand name is used for export due to the dilution of the [[Daewoo]] brand.\n\nIt is a major port, especially for rice shipments, and is a commercial center for the rice grown in the Geum basin. Rice processing and shipbuilding are important industries, and paper, lumber, rubber, and plastic are also produced. Originally a poor fishing village, Gunsan gained importance with the development of its port, which was opened to foreign trade in 1899. The Japanese, who ruled Korea from 1905 to 1945, further developed the city and port.\n\nJust south of Gunsan is the newly opened [[Saemangum Seawall]], the longest [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] in the world.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Tourist attractions===\n[[File:Wolmyeongparktw.jpg|250px|thumb|Wolmyeong Park (Susi Tower)]]\n[[File:Dongguktemple.jpg|250px|thumb|Dongguksa]]\n\nThe [[Gunsan Islands]] consist of 16 inhabited islands and 47 uninhabited islands. Gogunsangundo Islands constitutes Shinsido Island, Munyeodo Island, Bangchukdo Island, and Maldo Island, and Seonyudo Island is the center of the islands. A passenger ship to Seonyudo Island operates on average 6-8 times a day.\n\n''Eunpa,'' meaning \"Silver Wave\" (because of its feature of shining water under sunshine), was originally a reservoir for agriculture but designated as a National Tourist Place in 1985. In spring, a 1-km cherry blossom tunnel is formed from the entrance to the facility compound. In summer, people can enjoy wind surfing and boating in the acacia fragrance. In fall, people can enjoy walking along a promenade stretching from the meeting square at the entrance while picking up chestnuts. It is not only known as a local representation of Gunsan, but also as the nation's tourist place with a mixture of Mulbit (Water and Light) Bridge 370 m long and 3 m wide. A music fountain operates 8 times, 20 minutes per round. It was selected as one of the 100 Big Noted Tourists in Korea in the 'Creating a Good Place to Live' local resources contest.\n\nIn 1990, a river mouth bank was constructed at the mouth of Geum Rivers, which was the gateway of [[Baekje]]. It is spotlighted as the largest migrant bird colony in Korea with reed forests. It has become nationally famous because of the grand sight of many uncommon migratory birds such as Baikal teals, wild ducks, mallards, wild geese, herring gulls, black head gulls, black head Kentish plovers, etc., and approximately 500,000 winter migrant birds of 40 types visit between mid-October and March. A 360-degree observatory offers detailed and close-up views of migrant birds of the Geumgang River area, and the Bird Watching Gallery is the best vantage point in all of Korea to view migratory birds.\n\n[[Wolmyeong Dong Park|Wolmyeong Park]] is in the middle of Gunsan city. During spring, colorful cherry blossoms and camellia flowers are in full bloom, while the foliage attracts visitors during fall.{{fact|date=February 2019}} On the mountain top, both Geumgang (river) and West sea are visible.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nJapanese style houses in Sinheung-Dong are traditional houses of Japanese style, which was constructed by Hiroth, a Japanese fabric dealer of large scale during the colonial era. It has a great architectural value{{fact|date=February 2019}} as the roof, finishing touch of outer wall, and inner garden are kept as they were when it was first constructed. It is also a place of filming the movies, such as ''The Son of the General'' and ''Ttajja''.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nDongguksa is the only temple left in Korea which was built in Japanese style. Plain eaves and many windows of the outer wall of the main temple are the characteristics of Japanese temples.\n\nJinpo Marine Park is a theme park that displays retired military equipment (13 types, 16 equipment) of the armed forces, such as Korean naval vessels, at the inner harbor of the historical site of Jinpo battle, recorded to be the first naval battle with guns of warships in the world.\n\nSaemanguem New Year's Festival is hosted on the first day (January 1) of every year at Saemangeum seawall, the longest seawall in the world. Through events, such as sharing rice cake soup, writing new wishes, and releasing balloons of hopes, this day provides an opportunity to plan the new year with family, make wishes, and feel the mystique and deep sensation of nature.\n\n===Festival===\n*Saemanguem New Year's Festival\n*Kunsan Time Travel Festival\n\n===Museum===\n* [[Gunsan Modern History Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Gunsan

South Korea|city]] in [[North Jeolla Province]], [[South Korea]]. It is on the south bank of the [[Geum River]] just upstream from its exit into the [[Yellow Sea]]. It has emerged as a high-tech manufacturing industrial city and an international trade seaport that is approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Seoul on the midwest coast of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]] is in the city. To encourage investment, a free trade zone has been declared in the area.\n\nNotable residents of Gunsan include actress [[Lee Eun-ju]], comedian [[Park Myeong-su]], and [[Teen Top]] member L.Joe. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Kunsan air base with F-16s.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kunsan Air Base]]]]\n\nGunsan was a small fishing village on the banks of the Geum River, near where the river spills into the Yellow Sea. It sits on the fertile western ''Honam'' plain where much rice is harvested. Gunsan became a port in the late 19th century largely due to pressure from the Japanese on the Koreans to ship rice to [[Japan]]. In 1899, Gunsan Port officially opened up to international trade. Gunsan City was largely settled by Japanese during the period of the Japanese occupation. The old (now demolished) City Hall and the Customs House are of Japanese construction. After liberation from the Japanese in 1945, Gunsan began to grow slowly.\n\nThe [[Korean War]] of the 1950s left the Gunsan area relatively unscathed. The initial drive south by the Communist North Koreans pushed the [[United Nations]] and South Korean forces toward [[Busan]] so quickly that Gunsan was spared from protracted fighting.\n\nNevertheless, a battalion of [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Korean Marines]], entrenched in the hills above Gunsan Port, withheld overwhelming communist forces. Their bravery created extra time for the evacuation of the town and port. The action is commemorated with a monument on the ridgeline where the heaviest fighting occurred. ({{coord|35|59|26|N|126|42|16|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:KR-45|name=(monument)}})\n\nThe drive north by the United Nations forces occurred so rapidly that there was little direct confrontation in the area. After the cessation of hostilities, the [[United States Air Force]] occupied nearby Kunsan Air Base, which has affected Gunsan City.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] was originally constructed, under Japanese direction, by reclaiming mudflats starting in about 1923. Kunsan Air Base has hosted a variety of USAF combat aircraft. The proximity of US service members to Gunsan City has provided some economic growth to Gunsan City, but the base's influence has waned since the 1990s as a result of a more powerful and diversified Korean economy. The downtown shopping districts that catered to US troops have transformed into areas that are indistinguishable from surrounding areas that serve Korean shoppers. Only a few remaining stores hint at the area's previous manifestation as an American shopping district. The small Okku-Silver Town (or more popularly America Town) caters to US troops. About {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} from the main gate of Kunsan Air Base, America Town hosts bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops.\n\n==Economy==\nToday, Gunsan's economy thrives on fishing, agriculture and heavy industry west of the city in the reclaimed area known as the Industrial Zone. [[GM Korea]] operates a factory here that assembles the [[Chevrolet Aveo]] worldwide and as the [[Holden Barina]] in Australia and New Zealand. Near the port, the [[Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle]] factory produces Daewoo trucks for the domestic and export markets. In the domestic market vehicles are sold under Daewoo brand; the [[Tata Group|Tata]] brand name is used for export due to the dilution of the [[Daewoo]] brand.\n\nIt is a major port, especially for rice shipments, and is a commercial center for the rice grown in the Geum basin. Rice processing and shipbuilding are important industries, and paper, lumber, rubber, and plastic are also produced. Originally a poor fishing village, Gunsan gained importance with the development of its port, which was opened to foreign trade in 1899. The Japanese, who ruled Korea from 1905 to 1945, further developed the city and port.\n\nJust south of Gunsan is the newly opened [[Saemangum Seawall]], the longest [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] in the world.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Tourist attractions===\n[[File:Wolmyeongparktw.jpg|250px|thumb|Wolmyeong Park (Susi Tower)]]\n[[File:Dongguktemple.jpg|250px|thumb|Dongguksa]]\n\nThe [[Gunsan Islands]] consist of 16 inhabited islands and 47 uninhabited islands. Gogunsangundo Islands constitutes Shinsido Island, Munyeodo Island, Bangchukdo Island, and Maldo Island, and Seonyudo Island is the center of the islands. A passenger ship to Seonyudo Island operates on average 6-8 times a day.\n\n''Eunpa,'' meaning \"Silver Wave\" (because of its feature of shining water under sunshine), was originally a reservoir for agriculture but designated as a National Tourist Place in 1985. In spring, a 1-km cherry blossom tunnel is formed from the entrance to the facility compound. In summer, people can enjoy wind surfing and boating in the acacia fragrance. In fall, people can enjoy walking along a promenade stretching from the meeting square at the entrance while picking up chestnuts. It is not only known as a local representation of Gunsan, but also as the nation's tourist place with a mixture of Mulbit (Water and Light) Bridge 370 m long and 3 m wide. A music fountain operates 8 times, 20 minutes per round. It was selected as one of the 100 Big Noted Tourists in Korea in the 'Creating a Good Place to Live' local resources contest.\n\nIn 1990, a river mouth bank was constructed at the mouth of Geum Rivers, which was the gateway of [[Baekje]]. It is spotlighted as the largest migrant bird colony in Korea with reed forests. It has become nationally famous because of the grand sight of many uncommon migratory birds such as Baikal teals, wild ducks, mallards, wild geese, herring gulls, black head gulls, black head Kentish plovers, etc., and approximately 500,000 winter migrant birds of 40 types visit between mid-October and March. A 360-degree observatory offers detailed and close-up views of migrant birds of the Geumgang River area, and the Bird Watching Gallery is the best vantage point in all of Korea to view migratory birds.\n\n[[Wolmyeong Dong Park|Wolmyeong Park]] is in the middle of Gunsan city. During spring, colorful cherry blossoms and camellia flowers are in full bloom, while the foliage attracts visitors during fall.{{fact|date=February 2019}} On the mountain top, both Geumgang (river) and West sea are visible.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nJapanese style houses in Sinheung-Dong are traditional houses of Japanese style, which was constructed by Hiroth, a Japanese fabric dealer of large scale during the colonial era. It has a great architectural value{{fact|date=February 2019}} as the roof, finishing touch of outer wall, and inner garden are kept as they were when it was first constructed. It is also a place of filming the movies, such as ''The Son of the General'' and ''Ttajja''.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nDongguksa is the only temple left in Korea which was built in Japanese style. Plain eaves and many windows of the outer wall of the main temple are the characteristics of Japanese temples.\n\nJinpo Marine Park is a theme park that displays retired military equipment (13 types, 16 equipment) of the armed forces, such as Korean naval vessels, at the inner harbor of the historical site of Jinpo battle, recorded to be the first naval battle with guns of warships in the world.\n\nSaemanguem New Year's Festival is hosted on the first day (January 1) of every year at Saemangeum seawall, the longest seawall in the world. Through events, such as sharing rice cake soup, writing new wishes, and releasing balloons of hopes, this day provides an opportunity to plan the new year with family, make wishes, and feel the mystique and deep sensation of nature.\n\n===Festival===\n*Saemanguem New Year's Festival\n*Kunsan Time Travel Festival\n\n===Museum===\n* [[Gunsan Modern History Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Gunsan

He was born in a house right next to a bridge across the [[Sihl river]] (known as ''Teufelsbr\u00fccke''). The historical house, dated to the 14th century, was destroyed in 1814. The ''Restaurant Krone'' now stands in its place. \nHis father Wilhelm (d. 1534) was a chemist and physician, an illegitimate descendant of the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]]n noble family [[Bombast von Hohenheim]]. It has been suggested that Paracelsus's descent from the Bombast of Hohenheim family was his own invention, and that his father was in fact called ''H\u00f6hener'' and was a native of [[Gais]] in [[Appenzell]],<ref>''Allgemeine encyclop\u00e4die der wissenschaften und k\u00fcnste'' edd.

The claim that Paracelsus was of common birth from both his father's and his mother's side \nwas forwarded as early as 1572 by [[Thomas Erastus]] (who was hostile to Paracelsus). Erastus also cited the possibility that Paracelsus was native to a place called ''Altus Nidus'' (''Hohes Nest'') in Einsiedeln and that the name ''Paracelsus'' might be derived from this. K. J. Stephan, ''Neues Archiv f\u00fcr Geschichte, Staatenkunde, Literatur und Kunst'', vol. 2 (1830), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rEZEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA299 p. 299].\nThe suggestion of Paracelsus being a ''H\u00f6hener'' of Gais is apparently due to [[Albrecht von Haller]]. It was controversially discussed in the first half of the 19th century but by the 1880s was apparently no longer considered tenable; see: Eduard Schubert, ''Paracelsus-Forschungen'' vol. 1, '' andschriftliche Documente zur Lebensgeschichte Theophrasts von Hohenheim'' (1889), 96f.</ref> \nbut it is plausible that Wilhelm was the illegitimate son of Georg Bombast von Hohenheim (1453\u20131499), [[Commander (order)|commander]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in [[Rohrdorf, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Rohrdorf]].<ref>M\u00fcller-Jahncke, Wolf-Dieter, \"Paracelsus\" in: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'' 20 (2001), [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd11859169X.html 61\u201364].</ref>\n\nParacelsus's mother was probably a native of the Einsiedeln region and a bondswoman of [[Einsiedeln Abbey]], who before her marriage worked as superintendent in the abbey's hospital.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition|last = Wear|first = Andrew|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 311}}</ref> \nParacelsus in his writings repeatedly made references to his rustic origins and occasionally used ''Eremita'' (from the name of Einsiedeln, meaning \"hermitage\") as part of his name.<ref>\nC.

His reputation went before him, and the medical professionals excluded him from practicing.\n\nThe name ''Paracelsus'' is first attested in this year, used as a pseudonym for the publication of a ''Practica'' of political-astrological character in Nuremberg.<ref>''Practica D. Theophrasti Paracelsi, gemacht auff Europen, anzufahen in den nechstkunftigen Dreyssigsten Jar bi\u00df auff das Vier und Dreyssigst nachvolgend, Gedruckt zu N\u00fcrmberg durch Friderichen Peypus M.

The first use of ''Doctor Paracelsus'' in a medical publication was in 1536, as the author of the ''Grosse Wundartznei''. The name is usually interpreted as either a latinization of ''Hohenheim'' (based on ''[[:wikt:celsus|celsus]]'' \"high, tall\") or as the claim of \"surpassing [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]\". It has been argued that the name was not the invention of Paracelsus himself, who would have been opposed to the humanistic fashion of Latinized names, but was given to him by his circle of friends in Colmar in 1528. It is difficult to interpret but does appear to express the \"paradoxical\" character of the man, the prefix \"[[:wikt:\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac|para]]\" suggestively being echoed in the titles of Paracelsus's main philosophical works, ''Paragranum'' and ''Paramirum'' (as it were \"beyond the grain\" and \"beyond wonder\"); a ''paramiric'' treatise having been announced by Paracelsus as early as 1520.<ref>Pagel (1982), p. 5f.</ref>\n\nThe great medical problem of this period was [[syphilis]], then-recently imported from the West Indies, and running rampant as a [[pandemic]] completely untreated. Paracelsus vigorously attacked the treatment with [[guaiacum|guaiac wood]] as useless, a scam perpetrated by the [[Fugger]] of Augsburg as the main importers of the wood in two publications on the topic.\nWhen his further stay in Nuremberg had become impossible, he retired to [[Beratzhausen]], hoping to return to Nuremberg and publish an extended treatise on the \"French sickness\", but its publication was prohibited by a decree of the Leipzig faculty of medicine, represented by [[Heinrich Stromer]], a close friend and associate of the Fugger family.<ref>Ingrid K\u00e4stner, \nin Albrecht Classen (ed.), ''Religion und Gesundheit: Der heilkundliche Diskurs im 16.

Moving on to [[St. Gallen|St. Gall]], he then completed his ''Opus Paramirum'' in 1531, which he dedicated to [[Joachim Vadian]]. From St. Gall, he moved on to the land of [[Appenzell]], where he was active as lay preacher and healer among the peasantry.\nIn the same year, he also visited the mines in [[Schwaz]] and [[Hall in Tirol|Hall]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], working on his book on miners' diseases.\nHe moved on to [[Innsbruck]], where he was once again barred from practicing. He passed [[Sterzing]] in 1534, moving on to [[Merano|Meran]], [[Veltlin]], and [[St. Moritz]], which he praised for its healing springs. In Meran, he also came in contact with the socio-religious programs of the [[anabaptist]]s. He visited [[Pf\u00e4fers Abbey]], dedicating a separate pamphlet to its baths (1535).\nHe passed [[Kempten]], [[Memmingen]], [[Ulm]], and [[Augsburg]] in 1536. He finally managed to publish his ''Die grosse Wundartznei'' (\"The Great Surgery Book\"), printed in Ulm, Augsburg, and Frankfurt in this year.<ref>Pagel (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wO244WXEBKcC&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nHis ''Astronomia magna'' (also known as ''Philosophia sagax'') was completed in 1537, but published only in 1571.\nIt is a treatise on [[hermeticism]], [[astrology]], [[divination]], [[theology]], and [[demonology]], and it laid the basis of Paracelsus's later fame as a \"prophet\". His [[motto]] ''Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest'' (\"Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself\") is inscribed on a 1538 portrait by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]].\n\n===Death and legacy===\n{{see|#Reception and legacy}}\nIn 1541, Paracelsus moved to [[Salzburg]], probably on the invitation of [[Ernest of Bavaria]], where he died on 24 September. He was buried in [[St Sebastian's cemetery]] in Salzburg. His remains were relocated inside [[St. Sebastian's Church, Salzburg|St Sebastian's church]] in 1752.\n\nAfter his death, the movement of [[Paracelsianism]] was seized upon by many wishing to subvert the traditional [[Galen]]ic physics, and his therapies became more widely known and used. \nHis autographs have been lost, but many of his works which remained unpublished during his lifetime were edited by Johannes Huser of Basel during 1589\u20131591. \nHis works were frequently reprinted and widely read during the late 16th to early 17th century, and although his \"occult\" reputation remained controversial, his medical contributions were universally recognized, with e.g. a 1618  ''pharmacopeia'' by the Royal College of Physicians in London including \"Paracelsian\" remedies.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|title = International Year of Chemistry 2011: Paracelsus: In Praise of Mavericks|url = http://www.clinchem.org/content/57/6/932|journal = Clinical Chemistry|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 0009-9147|pages = 932\u2013934|volume = 57|issue = 6|doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2011.165894|first = Marek H.|last = Dominiczak|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThe late 16th century also saw substantial production of Pseudo-Paracelsian writing, especially letters attributed to Paracelsus, to the point where biographers find it impossible to draw a clear line between genuine tradition and legend.\n<ref>Joachim Telle, \"Paracelsus in pseudoparacelsischen Briefen\", ''Nova Acta Paracelsica'' 20/21 (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BGY22fzhPqwC&pg=PA147 147\u2013164].</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\nAs a physician of the early 16th century, Paracelsus held a natural affinity with the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], and [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] philosophies central to the Renaissance, a world-view exemplified by [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]].  [[Astrology]] was a very important part of Paracelsus's medicine and he was a practicing [[astrologer]]&nbsp;\u2013 as were many of the university-trained physicians working at that time in Europe. Paracelsus devoted several sections in his writings to the construction of astrological talismans for curing disease. He also invented an alphabet called the [[Alphabet of the Magi]], for engraving angelic names upon [[amulet|talisman]]s.{{dubious|date=June 2017}}<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Life of Paracelsus|last = Stoddart|first = Anna|publisher = Balefire Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> \nParacelsus largely rejected the philosophies of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]], as well as the theory of humours. Although he did accept the concept of [[the four elements]] as water, air, fire, and earth, he saw them merely as a foundation for other properties on which to build.<ref name=\"Pagel, Walter 1958\">Pagel, Walter. Paracelsus; an Introduction to Philosophical Medicine in the Era of the Renaissance. Basel: Karger, 1958. Print.</ref> \n\nHe often viewed fire as the [[Firmament]] that sat between air and water in the heavens. Paracelsus often uses an egg to help describe the elements. In his early model he claimed that air surrounded the world like an egg shell. The next element in his egg analogy is fire. Fire has a type of chaos to it that allows it to hold up earth and water, and this makes it like the egg white beneath the shell. The earth and water make up a globe which, in terms of the egg, is the yolk. In ''De Meteoris,''Paracelsus says that the firmament is the heavens. He changed the way he thought of the elements as his life went on. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Kahn|first=Didier|title=Unifying Heaven and Earth: Essays in the History of Early Modern Cosmology|publisher=Universitat de Barcelona|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions to medicine==\n[[File:Einsiedeln IMG 6265.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[Einsiedeln]], erected in 1941 on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Paracelsus's death, on the initiative of art historian Linus Birchler, first president of the Swiss Paracelsus Society.<ref>The sculpture shows an \"Einsiedeln woman with two healthy children\" (''Einsiedler Frau mit zwei gesunden Kindern'') as a symbol of \"motherly health\". A more conventional memorial, a [[:File:Paracelsus geburtsort gedenkstein.jpg|plaque]] showing the portrait of Paracelsus, was placed in Egg, Einsiedeln, in 1910 (now at the Teufelsbr\u00fccke, {{coord|47.1675|N|8.7668|E|}}).\nThe 1941 monument was harshly criticized as \"dishonest kitsch\" (''verlogener Kitsch'') in the service of a conservative Catholic \"cult of motherhood\" (''M\u00fctterlichkeitskult'')  by Franz Rueb in his (generally iconoclastic) ''Mythos Paracelsus'' (1995), p. 330.</ref>]]\n\n=== Chemistry ===\nParacelsus was one of the first medical professors to recognize that physicians required a solid academic knowledge in the natural sciences, especially [[chemistry]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in [[medicine]]. From his study of the elements, Paracelsus adopted the idea of tripartite alternatives to explain the nature of medicine, taking the place of a combustible element (sulphur), a fluid and changeable element (mercury), and a solid, permanent element (salt). The first mention of the mercury-sulphur-salt model was in the ''Opus paramirum'' dating to about 1530.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\">Webster, Charles. Paracelsus: Medicine, Magic and Mission at the End of Time. New Haven: Yale UP, 2008. Print.</ref> Paracelsus believed that the [[principle (chemistry)|principle]]s sulphur, mercury, and salt contained the poisons contributing to all diseases.<ref name=\"Pagel, Walter 1958\" /> He saw each disease as having three separate cures depending on how it was afflicted, either being caused by the poisoning of sulphur, mercury, or salt. Paracelsus drew the importance of sulphur, salt, and mercury from medieval alchemy, where they all occupied a prominent place. He demonstrated his theory by burning a piece of wood. The fire was the work of sulphur, the smoke was mercury, and the residual ash was salt.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" /> Paracelsus also believed that mercury, sulphur, and salt provided a good explanation for the nature of medicine because each of these properties existed in many physical forms. The ''tria prima'' also defined the human identity. Salt represented the body; mercury represented the spirit (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties); sulphur represented the soul (the emotions and desires). By understanding the chemical nature of the ''tria prima'', a physician could discover the means of curing disease. With every disease, the symptoms depended on which of the three principals caused the ailment.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" /> Paracelsus theorized that materials which are poisonous in large doses may be curative in small doses; he demonstrated this with the examples of magnetism and static electricity, wherein a small magnet can attract much larger metals.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" />\n\nHe was probably the first to give the element ''[[zinc]]'' (''zincum'') its modern name,<ref>{{Cite book\n |last      = Habashi\n |first     = Fathi\n |title     = Discovering the 8th metal\n |publisher = International Zinc Association\n |url       = http://www.zinc.org/general/ZP-Discovering_the_8th_Metal1.pdf\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150606210821/http://www.zinc.org/general/ZP-Discovering_the_8th_Metal1.pdf\n |url-status  = dead\n |archive-date = 2015-06-06\n |format    = PDF\n}}.</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/p/paracelsus.html\n |title=Paracelsus\n |author=Hefner Alan \n}}</ref>  in about 1526, likely based on the sharp pointed appearance of its crystals after smelting (''zinke'' translating to \"pointed\" in German). \nParacelsus invented chemical therapy, chemical urinalysis, and suggested a biochemical theory of digestion.<ref name=\":2\" /> Paracelsus used chemistry and chemical analogies in his teachings to medical students and to the medical establishment, many of whom found them objectionable.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|title = Paracelsus: Herald of Modern Toxicology|url = http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/2|journal = Toxicological Sciences|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 1096-6080|pmid = 10653514|pages = 2\u20134|volume = 53|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/toxsci/53.1.2|first = Joseph F.|last = Borzelleca|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nParacelsus in the beginning of the sixteenth century had unknowingly observed [[hydrogen]] as he noted that in reaction when [[acids]] attack [[metals]], gas was a [[by-product]].<ref name=\"Rigden2003\">{{cite book|author=John S.

He took a different approach from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. As a result of this hermetical idea of harmony, the universe's macrocosm was represented in every person as a microcosm. An example of this correspondence is the [[doctrine of signatures]] used to identify curative powers of plants. If a plant looked like a part of the body, then this signified its ability to cure this given anatomy. Therefore, the root of the orchid looks like a testicle and can therefore heal any testicle-associated illness.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition|last = Wear|first = Andrew|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 314}}</ref> Paracelsus mobilized the microcosm-macrocosm theory to demonstrate the analogy between the aspirations to salvation and health. As humans must ward off the influence of evil spirits with morality, they must also ward off diseases with good health.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" />\n\nParacelsus believed that true anatomy could only be understood once the nourishment for each part of the body was discovered. He believed that one must therefore know the influence of the stars on these particular body parts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition|last = Wear|first = Andrew|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 315}}</ref> Diseases were caused by poisons brought from the stars. However, 'poisons' were not necessarily something negative, in part because related substances interacted, but also because only the dose determined if a substance was poisonous or not. Paracelsus claimed the complete opposite of Galen, in that like cures like. If a star or poison caused a disease, then it must be countered by another star or poison.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because everything in the universe was interrelated, beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals, and various chemical combinations thereof. Paracelsus viewed the universe as one coherent organism that is pervaded by a uniting lifegiving spirit, and this in its entirety, humans included, was 'God'. His beliefs put him at odds with the Catholic Church, for which there necessarily had to be a difference between the creator and the created.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Alex Wittendorff |author2=Claus Bj\u00f8rn |author3=Ole Peter Grell |author4=T.

He extolled the benefits of opium, and of a pill he called laudanum, which has frequently been asserted by others to have been an opium tincture. Paracelsus did not leave a complete recipe, and the known ingredients differ considerably from 17th-century [[laudanum]].<ref name=\"Sigerist\">{{cite journal |last1=Sigerist |first1=H. E. |title=Laudanum in the Works of Paracelsus |journal=Bull. Hist.

Paracelsus's recipe forms the basis for most later versions of liniment.<ref>Michael Quinion, ''World Wide Words'', [http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-opo1.htm May 27, 2006]</ref>\n\nHis work ''Die gro\u00dfe Wundarzney'' is a forerunner of [[antisepsis]]. This specific empirical knowledge originated from his personal experiences as an army physician in the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War|Venetian wars]]. Paracelsus demanded that the application of cow dung, feathers and other noxious concoctions to wounds be surrendered in favor of keeping the wounds clean, stating, \"If you prevent infection, Nature will heal the wound all by herself.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> During his time as a military surgeon, Paracelsus was exposed to the crudity of medical knowledge at the time, when doctors believed that infection was a natural part of the healing process. He advocated for cleanliness and protection of wounds, as well as the regulation of diet. Popular ideas of the time opposed these theories and suggested sewing or plastering wounds.<ref name=\"TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M 1917 pp. 390-402\" /> Historians of syphilitic disease credit Paracelsus with the recognition of the inherited{{clarify|date=October 2019}} character of [[syphilis]]. In his first medical publication, a short pamphlet on syphilis treatment that was also the most comprehensive clinical description the period ever produced, he wrote a clinical description of syphilis in which he maintained that it could be treated by carefully measured doses of mercury.<ref name=\"TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M 1917 pp. 390-402\" /> Similarly, he was the first to discover that the disease could only be contracted by contact.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Hippocrates]] put forward the theory that illness was caused by an imbalance of the [[humorism|four humors]]: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. These ideas were further developed by [[Galen]] into an extremely influential and highly persistent set of medical beliefs that were to last until the mid-1850s. Contrarily, Paracelsus believed in three humors: salt (representing stability), sulphur (representing combustibility), and mercury (representing liquidity); he defined disease as a separation of one humor from the other two. He believed that body organs functioned alchemically, that is, they separated pure from impure.<ref name=\":3\" />  The dominant medical treatments in Paracelsus's time were specific diets to help in the \"cleansing of the putrefied juices\" combined with purging and [[bloodletting]] to restore the balance of the four humors.  Paracelsus supplemented and challenged this view with his beliefs that illness was the result of the body being attacked by ''outside'' agents. He objected to excessive bloodletting, saying that the process disturbed the harmony of the system, and that blood could not be purified by lessening its quantity.<ref name=\"TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M 1917 pp. 390-402\">THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PARACELSUS TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M. Stillman The Monist, Vol. 27, No. 3 (JULY, 1917), pp. 390\u2013402</ref>\n\nParacelsus gave birth to clinical diagnosis and the administration of highly specific medicines. This was uncommon for a period heavily exposed to cure-all remedies. The [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] was anticipated by him as he proposed that diseases were entities in themselves, rather than states of being. Paracelsus first introduced the [[black hellebore]] to European pharmacology and prescribed the correct dosage to alleviate certain forms of arteriosclerosis. Lastly, he recommended the use of iron for \"poor blood\" and is credited with the creation of the terms \"chemistry,\" \"gas,\" and \"alcohol\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDuring Paracelsus's lifetime and after his death, he was often celebrated as a wonder healer and investigator of those folk medicines that were rejected by the fathers of medicine (e.g. Galen, Avicenna). It was believed that he had success with his own remedies curing the plague, according to those that revered him. Since effective medicines for serious infectious diseases weren't invented before the 19th century, Paracelsus came up with many prescriptions and concoctions on his own. For infectious diseases with fever, it was common to prescribe [[diaphoretic]]s and [[Herbal tonic|tonic]]s that at least gave temporary relief. Also many of his remedies contained the famed \"[[theriac]]\", a preparation derived from oriental medicine sometimes containing opium. The following prescription by Paracelsus was dedicated to the village of [[Sterzing]].\n\n{{Quote\n|style=font-style: italic;\n|text=Also sol das trank gemacht werden, dadurch die pestilenz im schweiss ausgetrieben wird: (So the potion should be made, whereby the pestilence is expelled in sweat:)\n:eines guten gebranten weins...ein mo\u00df,  (Medicinal brandy)\n:eines guten tiriaks zw\u00f6lf lot,  (Theriac)\n:myrrhen vier lot,  (Myrrh)\n:wurzen von ro\u00dfhuf sechs lot, (Tussilago sp.)\n:sperma ceti,\n:terrae sigillatae ietlichs ein lot,  (Medicinal earth)\n:schwalbenwurz zwei lot,  (Vincetoxicum sp.)\n:diptan, bibernel, baldrianwurzel ietlichs ein lot (Dictamnus albus, Valerian, Pimpinella)\n:gaffer ein quint.

His countless wanderings also brought him deep into many areas of the [[Alps]], where such therapies were already practiced on a less common scale than today.<ref>Natura Sophia.

He clearly expounded the concept of dose response in his ''Third Defense'', where he stated that \"Solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison.\"  (''Sola dosis facit venenum'' \"[[The dose makes the poison|Only the dose makes the poison]]\")<ref>Paracelsus, dritte defensio, 1538.</ref>\nThis was used to defend his use of inorganic substances in medicine as outsiders frequently criticized Paracelsus's chemical agents as too toxic to be used as therapeutic agents.<ref name=\":3\" />\nHis belief that diseases locate in a specific organ was extended to inclusion of target organ toxicity; that is, there is a specific site in the body where a chemical will exert its greatest effect. Paracelsus also encouraged using experimental animals to study both beneficial and toxic chemical effects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Psychosomatism===\n\nIn his work ''Von den Krankeiten'' Paracelsus writes: \"Thus, the cause of the disease [[chorea]] lasciva [<nowiki/>[[Sydenham's chorea]], or St. Vitus' Dance] is a mere opinion and idea, assumed by imagination, affecting those who believe in such a thing. This opinion and idea are the origin of the disease both in children and adults. \nIn children the case is also imagination, based not on thinking but on perceiving, because they have heard or seen something. The reason is this: their sight and hearing are so strong that unconsciously they have fantasies about what they have seen or heard.\"<ref>{{Citation |title=The History of Psychotherapy: From Healing Magic to Encounter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7VGgQi3NJY8C&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=their+sight+and+hearing+are+so+strong+that+unconsciously+they+have+fantasies+about+what+they+have+seen+or+heard#v=onepage&q=their%20sight%20and%20hearing%20are%20so%20strong%20that%20unconsciously%20they%20have%20fantasies%20about%20what%20they%20have%20seen%20or%20heard&f=false |page=200|isbn=9780876682807 |author1=Ehrenwald |first1=Jan |year=1976 }}</ref> Paracelsus called for the humane treatment of the mentally ill as he saw them not to be possessed by evil spirits, but merely 'brothers' ensnared in a treatable malady.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n===Portraits===\n[[File:Paracelsus-03.jpg|thumb|The 1540 portrait by Hirschvogel.]]\n[[File:Paracelsus 1567.jpg|thumb|The 1567 \"Rosicrucian\" portrait.]]\n[[File:Effigies Paracelsi Medici Celeberrimi FA 2000.001.203.jpg|thumb| Engraving by Pieter Van Sompel, before 1643; After [[Pieter Soutman]] ]]\n[[File:Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (Paracelsus).

Above and below the image are the mottos \n''Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest'' (\"Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself\") and ''Omne donum perfectum a Deo, inperfectum a Diabolo'' (\"All perfect gifts are from God, [all] imperfect [ones] from the Devil\"); later portraits give a German rendition in two rhyming couplets (''Eines andern Knecht soll Niemand sein / der f\u00fcr sich bleiben kann allein /all gute Gaben sint von Got / des Teufels aber sein Spot'').<ref>Werneck in ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur praktischen Heilkunde: mit vorz\u00fcglicher Ber\u00fccksichtigung der medicinischen Geographie, Topographie und Epidemiologie'', Volume 3 (1836), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wW8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA214&lpg=PA212 212\u2013216].\n''Neues Journal zur Litteratur und Kunstgeschichte'', Volume 2 (1799), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iEdMAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q&f=false 246\u2013256].</ref>\nPosthumous portraits of Paracelsus, made for publications of his books during the second half of the 16th century, often show him in the same pose, holding his sword by its pommel.\n\nThe so-called \"Rosicrucian portrait\", published with '' Philosophiae magnae Paracelsi'' (Heirs of Arnold Birckmann, Cologne, 1567), is closely based on the 1540 portrait by Hirschvogel (but mirrored, so that now Paracelsus's left hand rests on the sword pommel), adding a variety of additional elements: the pommel of the sword is inscribed by ''[[Azoth]]'', and next to the figure of Paracelsus, the [[Bombast von Hohenheim]] arms are shown (with an additional border of eight [[cross patty|crosses patty]]).<ref>\nThe von Hohenheim arms showed a blue (azure) bend with three white (argent) balls in a yellow (or) field (Julius Kindler von Knobloch, ''Oberbadisches Geschlechterbuch'' vol. 1, 1894, [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/kindlervonknobloch1898bd1/0146 p. 142]), i.e. without the border. Franz Hartmann, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeanddoctrine00hartgoog Life and Doctrines]'' (1887), [https://archive.org/details/lifeanddoctrine00hartgoog p. 12] describes the \narms shown on the monument in St Sebastian church, Salzburg as  \"a beam of silver, upon which are ranged three black balls\".</ref>\nShown in the background are \"early [[Rosicrucian]] symbols\", including the head of a child protruding from the ground (indicating rebirth). The portrait is possibly a work by [[Frans Hogenberg]], acting under the directions of Theodor Birckmann (1531/33\u20131586).\n\n===Paracelsianism and Rosicrucianism===\n{{see|Paracelsianism}}\n\nParacelsus was especially venerated by German [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]], who regarded him as a prophet, and developed a field of systematic study of his writings, which is sometimes called \"[[Paracelsianism]]\", or more rarely \"Paracelsism\". [[Francis Bacon]] warned against Paracelsus and the Rosicrucians, judging that \"the ancient opinion that man was ''microcosmus''\"  had been \"fantastically strained by Paracelsus and the alchemists\".<ref>F.A. Yates, ''Rosicrucian Enlightenment'' (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXFHAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA120 p. 120].</ref>\n\n\"Paracelsism\" also produced the first complete edition of Paracelsus's works. Johannes Huser of [[Basel]] (c. 1545\u20131604) gathered autographs and manuscript copies, and prepared an edition in ten volumes during 1589\u20131591.<ref>Huser quart edition (medicinal and philosophical treatises), ten volumes, Basel, 1589\u20131591; Huser's edition of Paracelsus's surgical works was published posthumously in Strasbourg, 1605.</ref>\n\nThe prophecies contained in Paracelsus's works on astrology and divination began to be separately edited as ''Prognosticon Theophrasti Paracelsi'' in the early 17th century. His prediction of a \"great calamity just beginning\" indicating the [[End Times]] was later associated with the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the identification of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] as the \"Lion from the North\" is based in one of Paracelsus's \"prognostications\" referencing [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 5:6.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''Apocalypses: Prophecies, Cults, and Millennial Beliefs Through the Ages'' (2000),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=nz5m0vZHYx8C&pg=PA86 p. 86].</ref>\n\n[[Carl Gustav Jung]] studied Paracelsus intensively. His work ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis|Mysterium Conjunctionis]]'' further drew from alchemical symbolism as a tool in psychotherapy. Following Paracelsus's path, it was Jung who first theorised that the symbolic language of alchemy was an expression of innate but unconscious psychological processes.\n\n===In literature and drama===\nA number of fictionalised depictions of Paracelsus have been published in modern literature. The first presentation of Paracelsus's life in the form of a [[historical novel]] was published in 1830 by Diocl\u00e8s Fabre d'Olivet (1811\u20131848, son of [[Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]]),<ref>''Un m\u00e9decin d'autrefois.

Meinrad Lienert, \"Der Hexenmeister\" in: ''Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten'', Stuttgart (1915).</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Schnitzler]] wrote a verse play  ''Paracelsus'' in 1899. [[Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer]] wrote a novel trilogy (''Paracelsus-Trilogie''), published during 1917\u201326. Martha Sills-Fuchs (1896\u20131987) wrote three ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' plays with Paracelsus as the main character during 1936\u20131939 in which Paracelsus is depicted as the prophetic healer of the [[German people]].<ref>Udo Benzenh\u00f6fer, \"Die Paracelsus-Dramen der Martha Sills-Fuchs im Unfeld des 'Vereins Deutsche Volksheilkunde' Julius Streichers\" in Peter Dilg, Hartmut Rudolph (eds.), ''Resultate und Desiderate der Paracelsus-Forschun'' (1993, 163\u201381.</ref> \nThe [[cinema of Germany|German]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Paracelsus (film)|Paracelsus]]'' was made in [[1943 in film|1943]], directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37218/Paracelsus/details |title=NY Times: Paracelsus |accessdate=2009-09-13|work=NY Times}}</ref> Also in 1943, Richard Billinger wrote a play ''Paracelsus'' for the [[Salzburg Festival]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6oiD85C9HzUC&pg=PA73 p. 73].</ref>\n\n[[Mika Waltari]]'s ''[[Mikael Karvajalka]]'' (1948) has a scene fictionalising Paracelsus's acquisition of his legendary sword. Paracelsus is the main character of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story ''La rosa de Paracelso'' (anthologized in ''[[Shakespeare's Memory (short story collection)|Shakespeare's Memory]]'', 1983). An alchemist based on him named Van Hohenheim is one of the main characters of the manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''.

He was born in a house right next to a bridge across the [[Sihl river]] (known as ''Teufelsbr\u00fccke''). The historical house, dated to the 14th century, was destroyed in 1814. The ''Restaurant Krone'' now stands in its place. \nHis father Wilhelm (d. 1534) was a chemist and physician, an illegitimate descendant of the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]]n noble family [[Bombast von Hohenheim]]. It has been suggested that Paracelsus's descent from the Bombast of Hohenheim family was his own invention, and that his father was in fact called ''H\u00f6hener'' and was a native of [[Gais]] in [[Appenzell]],<ref>''Allgemeine encyclop\u00e4die der wissenschaften und k\u00fcnste'' edd. J. S. Ersch, J. G.

The claim that Paracelsus was of common birth from both his father's and his mother's side \nwas forwarded as early as 1572 by [[Thomas Erastus]] (who was hostile to Paracelsus). Erastus also cited the possibility that Paracelsus was native to a place called ''Altus Nidus'' (''Hohes Nest'') in Einsiedeln and that the name ''Paracelsus'' might be derived from this. K. J. Stephan, ''Neues Archiv f\u00fcr Geschichte, Staatenkunde, Literatur und Kunst'', vol. 2 (1830), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rEZEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA299 p. 299].\nThe suggestion of Paracelsus being a ''H\u00f6hener'' of Gais is apparently due to [[Albrecht von Haller]]. It was controversially discussed in the first half of the 19th century but by the 1880s was apparently no longer considered tenable; see: Eduard Schubert, ''Paracelsus-Forschungen'' vol. 1, '' andschriftliche Documente zur Lebensgeschichte Theophrasts von Hohenheim'' (1889), 96f.</ref> \nbut it is plausible that Wilhelm was the illegitimate son of Georg Bombast von Hohenheim (1453\u20131499), [[Commander (order)|commander]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] in [[Rohrdorf, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Rohrdorf]].<ref>M\u00fcller-Jahncke, Wolf-Dieter, \"Paracelsus\" in: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'' 20 (2001), [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd11859169X.html 61\u201364].</ref>\n\nParacelsus's mother was probably a native of the Einsiedeln region and a bondswoman of [[Einsiedeln Abbey]], who before her marriage worked as superintendent in the abbey's hospital.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition|last = Wear|first = Andrew|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 311}}</ref> \nParacelsus in his writings repeatedly made references to his rustic origins and occasionally used ''Eremita'' (from the name of Einsiedeln, meaning \"hermitage\") as part of his name.<ref>\nC.

His reputation went before him, and the medical professionals excluded him from practicing.\n\nThe name ''Paracelsus'' is first attested in this year, used as a pseudonym for the publication of a ''Practica'' of political-astrological character in Nuremberg.<ref>''Practica D.

The first use of ''Doctor Paracelsus'' in a medical publication was in 1536, as the author of the ''Grosse Wundartznei''. The name is usually interpreted as either a latinization of ''Hohenheim'' (based on ''[[:wikt:celsus|celsus]]'' \"high, tall\") or as the claim of \"surpassing [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]\". It has been argued that the name was not the invention of Paracelsus himself, who would have been opposed to the humanistic fashion of Latinized names, but was given to him by his circle of friends in Colmar in 1528. It is difficult to interpret but does appear to express the \"paradoxical\" character of the man, the prefix \"[[:wikt:\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac|para]]\" suggestively being echoed in the titles of Paracelsus's main philosophical works, ''Paragranum'' and ''Paramirum'' (as it were \"beyond the grain\" and \"beyond wonder\"); a ''paramiric'' treatise having been announced by Paracelsus as early as 1520.<ref>Pagel (1982), p. 5f.</ref>\n\nThe great medical problem of this period was [[syphilis]], then-recently imported from the West Indies, and running rampant as a [[pandemic]] completely untreated. Paracelsus vigorously attacked the treatment with [[guaiacum|guaiac wood]] as useless, a scam perpetrated by the [[Fugger]] of Augsburg as the main importers of the wood in two publications on the topic.\nWhen his further stay in Nuremberg had become impossible, he retired to [[Beratzhausen]], hoping to return to Nuremberg and publish an extended treatise on the \"French sickness\", but its publication was prohibited by a decree of the Leipzig faculty of medicine, represented by [[Heinrich Stromer]], a close friend and associate of the Fugger family.<ref>Ingrid K\u00e4stner, \nin Albrecht Classen (ed.), ''Religion und Gesundheit: Der heilkundliche Diskurs im 16.

Moving on to [[St. Gallen|St. Gall]], he then completed his ''Opus Paramirum'' in 1531, which he dedicated to [[Joachim Vadian]]. From St. Gall, he moved on to the land of [[Appenzell]], where he was active as lay preacher and healer among the peasantry.\nIn the same year, he also visited the mines in [[Schwaz]] and [[Hall in Tirol|Hall]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], working on his book on miners' diseases.\nHe moved on to [[Innsbruck]], where he was once again barred from practicing. He passed [[Sterzing]] in 1534, moving on to [[Merano|Meran]], [[Veltlin]], and [[St. Moritz]], which he praised for its healing springs. In Meran, he also came in contact with the socio-religious programs of the [[anabaptist]]s. He visited [[Pf\u00e4fers Abbey]], dedicating a separate pamphlet to its baths (1535).\nHe passed [[Kempten]], [[Memmingen]], [[Ulm]], and [[Augsburg]] in 1536. He finally managed to publish his ''Die grosse Wundartznei'' (\"The Great Surgery Book\"), printed in Ulm, Augsburg, and Frankfurt in this year.<ref>Pagel (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wO244WXEBKcC&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nHis ''Astronomia magna'' (also known as ''Philosophia sagax'') was completed in 1537, but published only in 1571.\nIt is a treatise on [[hermeticism]], [[astrology]], [[divination]], [[theology]], and [[demonology]], and it laid the basis of Paracelsus's later fame as a \"prophet\". His [[motto]] ''Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest'' (\"Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself\") is inscribed on a 1538 portrait by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]].\n\n===Death and legacy===\n{{see|#Reception and legacy}}\nIn 1541, Paracelsus moved to [[Salzburg]], probably on the invitation of [[Ernest of Bavaria]], where he died on 24 September. He was buried in [[St Sebastian's cemetery]] in Salzburg. His remains were relocated inside [[St. Sebastian's Church, Salzburg|St Sebastian's church]] in 1752.\n\nAfter his death, the movement of [[Paracelsianism]] was seized upon by many wishing to subvert the traditional [[Galen]]ic physics, and his therapies became more widely known and used. \nHis autographs have been lost, but many of his works which remained unpublished during his lifetime were edited by Johannes Huser of Basel during 1589\u20131591. \nHis works were frequently reprinted and widely read during the late 16th to early 17th century, and although his \"occult\" reputation remained controversial, his medical contributions were universally recognized, with e.g. a 1618  ''pharmacopeia'' by the Royal College of Physicians in London including \"Paracelsian\" remedies.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|title = International Year of Chemistry 2011: Paracelsus: In Praise of Mavericks|url = http://www.clinchem.org/content/57/6/932|journal = Clinical Chemistry|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 0009-9147|pages = 932\u2013934|volume = 57|issue = 6|doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2011.165894|first = Marek H.|last = Dominiczak|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nThe late 16th century also saw substantial production of Pseudo-Paracelsian writing, especially letters attributed to Paracelsus, to the point where biographers find it impossible to draw a clear line between genuine tradition and legend.\n<ref>Joachim Telle, \"Paracelsus in pseudoparacelsischen Briefen\", ''Nova Acta Paracelsica'' 20/21 (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BGY22fzhPqwC&pg=PA147 147\u2013164].</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\nAs a physician of the early 16th century, Paracelsus held a natural affinity with the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], and [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] philosophies central to the Renaissance, a world-view exemplified by [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]].  [[Astrology]] was a very important part of Paracelsus's medicine and he was a practicing [[astrologer]]&nbsp;\u2013 as were many of the university-trained physicians working at that time in Europe. Paracelsus devoted several sections in his writings to the construction of astrological talismans for curing disease. He also invented an alphabet called the [[Alphabet of the Magi]], for engraving angelic names upon [[amulet|talisman]]s.{{dubious|date=June 2017}}<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Life of Paracelsus|last = Stoddart|first = Anna|publisher = Balefire Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> \nParacelsus largely rejected the philosophies of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]], as well as the theory of humours. Although he did accept the concept of [[the four elements]] as water, air, fire, and earth, he saw them merely as a foundation for other properties on which to build.<ref name=\"Pagel, Walter 1958\">Pagel, Walter. Paracelsus; an Introduction to Philosophical Medicine in the Era of the Renaissance. Basel: Karger, 1958. Print.</ref> \n\nHe often viewed fire as the [[Firmament]] that sat between air and water in the heavens. Paracelsus often uses an egg to help describe the elements. In his early model he claimed that air surrounded the world like an egg shell. The next element in his egg analogy is fire. Fire has a type of chaos to it that allows it to hold up earth and water, and this makes it like the egg white beneath the shell. The earth and water make up a globe which, in terms of the egg, is the yolk. In ''De Meteoris,''Paracelsus says that the firmament is the heavens. He changes the way he thinks of the elements as his life goes on. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Kahn|first=Didier|title=Unifying Heaven and Earth: Essays in the History of Early Modern Cosmology|publisher=Universitat de Barcelona|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n==Contributions to medicine==\n[[File:Einsiedeln IMG 6265.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[Einsiedeln]], erected in 1941 on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Paracelsus's death, on the initiative of art historian Linus Birchler, first president of the Swiss Paracelsus Society.<ref>The sculpture shows an \"Einsiedeln woman with two healthy children\" (''Einsiedler Frau mit zwei gesunden Kindern'') as a symbol of \"motherly health\". A more conventional memorial, a [[:File:Paracelsus geburtsort gedenkstein.jpg|plaque]] showing the portrait of Paracelsus, was placed in Egg, Einsiedeln, in 1910 (now at the Teufelsbr\u00fccke, {{coord|47.1675|N|8.7668|E|}}).\nThe 1941 monument was harshly criticized as \"dishonest kitsch\" (''verlogener Kitsch'') in the service of a conservative Catholic \"cult of motherhood\" (''M\u00fctterlichkeitskult'')  by Franz Rueb in his (generally iconoclastic) ''Mythos Paracelsus'' (1995), p. 330.</ref>]]\n\n=== Chemistry ===\nParacelsus was one of the first medical professors to recognize that physicians required a solid academic knowledge in the natural sciences, especially [[chemistry]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in [[medicine]]. From his study of the elements, Paracelsus adopted the idea of tripartite alternatives to explain the nature of medicine, taking the place of a combustible element (sulphur), a fluid and changeable element (mercury), and a solid, permanent element (salt). The first mention of the mercury-sulphur-salt model was in the ''Opus paramirum'' dating to about 1530.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\">Webster, Charles. Paracelsus: Medicine, Magic and Mission at the End of Time. New Haven: Yale UP, 2008. Print.</ref> Paracelsus believed that the [[principle (chemistry)|principle]]s sulphur, mercury, and salt contained the poisons contributing to all diseases.<ref name=\"Pagel, Walter 1958\" /> He saw each disease as having three separate cures depending on how it was afflicted, either being caused by the poisoning of sulphur, mercury, or salt. Paracelsus drew the importance of sulphur, salt, and mercury from medieval alchemy, where they all occupied a prominent place. He demonstrated his theory by burning a piece of wood. The fire was the work of sulphur, the smoke was mercury, and the residual ash was salt.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" /> Paracelsus also believed that mercury, sulphur, and salt provided a good explanation for the nature of medicine because each of these properties existed in many physical forms. The ''tria prima'' also defined the human identity. Salt represented the body; mercury represented the spirit (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties); sulphur represented the soul (the emotions and desires). By understanding the chemical nature of the ''tria prima'', a physician could discover the means of curing disease. With every disease, the symptoms depended on which of the three principals caused the ailment.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" /> Paracelsus theorized that materials which are poisonous in large doses may be curative in small doses; he demonstrated this with the examples of magnetism and static electricity, wherein a small magnet can attract much larger metals.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" />\n\nHe was probably the first to give the element ''[[zinc]]'' (''zincum'') its modern name,<ref>{{Cite book\n |last      = Habashi\n |first     = Fathi\n |title     = Discovering the 8th metal\n |publisher = International Zinc Association\n |url       = http://www.zinc.org/general/ZP-Discovering_the_8th_Metal1.pdf\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150606210821/http://www.zinc.org/general/ZP-Discovering_the_8th_Metal1.pdf\n |url-status  = dead\n |archive-date = 2015-06-06\n |format    = PDF\n}}.</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/p/paracelsus.html\n |title=Paracelsus\n |author=Hefner Alan \n}}</ref>  in about 1526, likely based on the sharp pointed appearance of its crystals after smelting (''zinke'' translating to \"pointed\" in German). \nParacelsus invented chemical therapy, chemical urinalysis, and suggested a biochemical theory of digestion.<ref name=\":2\" /> Paracelsus used chemistry and chemical analogies in his teachings to medical students and to the medical establishment, many of whom found them objectionable.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|title = Paracelsus: Herald of Modern Toxicology|url = http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/2|journal = Toxicological Sciences|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 1096-6080|pmid = 10653514|pages = 2\u20134|volume = 53|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/toxsci/53.1.2|first = Joseph F.|last = Borzelleca|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nParacelsus in the beginning of the sixteenth century had unknowingly observed [[hydrogen]] as he noted that in reaction when [[acids]] attack [[metals]], gas was a [[by-product]].<ref name=\"Rigden2003\">{{cite book|author=John S.

He took a different approach from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. As a result of this hermetical idea of harmony, the universe's macrocosm was represented in every person as a microcosm. An example of this correspondence is the [[doctrine of signatures]] used to identify curative powers of plants. If a plant looked like a part of the body, then this signified its ability to cure this given anatomy. Therefore, the root of the orchid looks like a testicle and can therefore heal any testicle-associated illness.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition|last = Wear|first = Andrew|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 314}}</ref> Paracelsus mobilized the microcosm-macrocosm theory to demonstrate the analogy between the aspirations to salvation and health. As humans must ward off the influence of evil spirits with morality, they must also ward off diseases with good health.<ref name=\"Webster, Charles 2008\" />\n\nParacelsus believed that true anatomy could only be understood once the nourishment for each part of the body was discovered. He believed that one must therefore know the influence of the stars on these particular body parts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = The Western Medical Tradition|last = Wear|first = Andrew|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 315}}</ref> Diseases were caused by poisons brought from the stars. However, 'poisons' were not necessarily something negative, in part because related substances interacted, but also because only the dose determined if a substance was poisonous or not. Paracelsus claimed the complete opposite of Galen, in that like cures like. If a star or poison caused a disease, then it must be countered by another star or poison.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because everything in the universe was interrelated, beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals, and various chemical combinations thereof. Paracelsus viewed the universe as one coherent organism that is pervaded by a uniting lifegiving spirit, and this in its entirety, humans included, was 'God'. His beliefs put him at odds with the Catholic Church, for which there necessarily had to be a difference between the creator and the created.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Alex Wittendorff |author2=Claus Bj\u00f8rn |author3=Ole Peter Grell |author4=T.

He extolled the benefits of opium, and of a pill he called laudanum, which has frequently been asserted by others to have been an opium tincture. Paracelsus did not leave a complete recipe, and the known ingredients differ considerably from 17th-century [[laudanum]].<ref name=\"Sigerist\">{{cite journal |last1=Sigerist |first1=H.

Paracelsus's recipe forms the basis for most later versions of liniment.<ref>Michael Quinion, ''World Wide Words'', [http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-opo1.htm May 27, 2006]</ref>\n\nHis work ''Die gro\u00dfe Wundarzney'' is a forerunner of [[antisepsis]]. This specific empirical knowledge originated from his personal experiences as an army physician in the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War|Venetian wars]]. Paracelsus demanded that the application of cow dung, feathers and other noxious concoctions to wounds be surrendered in favor of keeping the wounds clean, stating, \"If you prevent infection, Nature will heal the wound all by herself.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> During his time as a military surgeon, Paracelsus was exposed to the crudity of medical knowledge at the time, when doctors believed that infection was a natural part of the healing process. He advocated for cleanliness and protection of wounds, as well as the regulation of diet. Popular ideas of the time opposed these theories and suggested sewing or plastering wounds.<ref name=\"TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M 1917 pp. 390-402\" /> Historians of syphilitic disease credit Paracelsus with the recognition of the inherited{{clarify|date=October 2019}} character of [[syphilis]]. In his first medical publication, a short pamphlet on syphilis treatment that was also the most comprehensive clinical description the period ever produced, he wrote a clinical description of syphilis in which he maintained that it could be treated by carefully measured doses of mercury.<ref name=\"TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M 1917 pp. 390-402\" /> Similarly, he was the first to discover that the disease could only be contracted by contact.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Hippocrates]] put forward the theory that illness was caused by an imbalance of the [[humorism|four humors]]: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. These ideas were further developed by [[Galen]] into an extremely influential and highly persistent set of medical beliefs that were to last until the mid-1850s. Contrarily, Paracelsus believed in three humors: salt (representing stability), sulphur (representing combustibility), and mercury (representing liquidity); he defined disease as a separation of one humor from the other two. He believed that body organs functioned alchemically, that is, they separated pure from impure.<ref name=\":3\" />  The dominant medical treatments in Paracelsus's time were specific diets to help in the \"cleansing of the putrefied juices\" combined with purging and [[bloodletting]] to restore the balance of the four humors.  Paracelsus supplemented and challenged this view with his beliefs that illness was the result of the body being attacked by ''outside'' agents. He objected to excessive bloodletting, saying that the process disturbed the harmony of the system, and that blood could not be purified by lessening its quantity.<ref name=\"TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M 1917 pp. 390-402\">THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PARACELSUS TO MEDICAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE J. M. Stillman The Monist, Vol. 27, No. 3 (JULY, 1917), pp. 390\u2013402</ref>\n\nParacelsus gave birth to clinical diagnosis and the administration of highly specific medicines. This was uncommon for a period heavily exposed to cure-all remedies. The [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] was anticipated by him as he proposed that diseases were entities in themselves, rather than states of being. Paracelsus first introduced the [[black hellebore]] to European pharmacology and prescribed the correct dosage to alleviate certain forms of arteriosclerosis. Lastly, he recommended the use of iron for \"poor blood\" and is credited with the creation of the terms \"chemistry,\" \"gas,\" and \"alcohol\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDuring Paracelsus's lifetime and after his death, he was often celebrated as a wonder healer and investigator of those folk medicines that were rejected by the fathers of medicine (e.g. Galen, Avicenna). It was believed that he had success with his own remedies curing the plague, according to those that revered him. Since effective medicines for serious infectious diseases weren't invented before the 19th century, Paracelsus came up with many prescriptions and concoctions on his own. For infectious diseases with fever, it was common to prescribe [[diaphoretic]]s and [[Herbal tonic|tonic]]s that at least gave temporary relief. Also many of his remedies contained the famed \"[[theriac]]\", a preparation derived from oriental medicine sometimes containing opium. The following prescription by Paracelsus was dedicated to the village of [[Sterzing]].\n\n{{Quote\n|style=font-style: italic;\n|text=Also sol das trank gemacht werden, dadurch die pestilenz im schweiss ausgetrieben wird: (So the potion should be made, whereby the pestilence is expelled in sweat:)\n:eines guten gebranten weins...ein mo\u00df,  (Medicinal brandy)\n:eines guten tiriaks zw\u00f6lf lot,  (Theriac)\n:myrrhen vier lot,  (Myrrh)\n:wurzen von ro\u00dfhuf sechs lot, (Tussilago sp.)\n:sperma ceti,\n:terrae sigillatae ietlichs ein lot,  (Medicinal earth)\n:schwalbenwurz zwei lot,  (Vincetoxicum sp.)\n:diptan, bibernel, baldrianwurzel ietlichs ein lot (Dictamnus albus, Valerian, Pimpinella)\n:gaffer ein quint.

His countless wanderings also brought him deep into many areas of the [[Alps]], where such therapies were already practiced on a less common scale than today.<ref>Natura Sophia.

He clearly expounded the concept of dose response in his ''Third Defense'', where he stated that \"Solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison.\"  (''Sola dosis facit venenum'' \"[[The dose makes the poison|Only the dose makes the poison]]\")<ref>Paracelsus, dritte defensio, 1538.</ref>\nThis was used to defend his use of inorganic substances in medicine as outsiders frequently criticized Paracelsus's chemical agents as too toxic to be used as therapeutic agents.<ref name=\":3\" />\nHis belief that diseases locate in a specific organ was extended to inclusion of target organ toxicity; that is, there is a specific site in the body where a chemical will exert its greatest effect. Paracelsus also encouraged using experimental animals to study both beneficial and toxic chemical effects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Psychosomatism===\n\nIn his work ''Von den Krankeiten'' Paracelsus writes: \"Thus, the cause of the disease [[chorea]] lasciva [<nowiki/>[[Sydenham's chorea]], or St. Vitus' Dance] is a mere opinion and idea, assumed by imagination, affecting those who believe in such a thing. This opinion and idea are the origin of the disease both in children and adults. \nIn children the case is also imagination, based not on thinking but on perceiving, because they have heard or seen something. The reason is this: their sight and hearing are so strong that unconsciously they have fantasies about what they have seen or heard.\"<ref>{{Citation |title=The History of Psychotherapy: From Healing Magic to Encounter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7VGgQi3NJY8C&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=their+sight+and+hearing+are+so+strong+that+unconsciously+they+have+fantasies+about+what+they+have+seen+or+heard#v=onepage&q=their%20sight%20and%20hearing%20are%20so%20strong%20that%20unconsciously%20they%20have%20fantasies%20about%20what%20they%20have%20seen%20or%20heard&f=false |page=200|isbn=9780876682807 |author1=Ehrenwald |first1=Jan |year=1976 }}</ref> Paracelsus called for the humane treatment of the mentally ill as he saw them not to be possessed by evil spirits, but merely 'brothers' ensnared in a treatable malady.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n===Portraits===\n[[File:Paracelsus-03.jpg|thumb|The 1540 portrait by Hirschvogel.]]\n[[File:Paracelsus 1567.jpg|thumb|The 1567 \"Rosicrucian\" portrait.]]\n[[File:Effigies Paracelsi Medici Celeberrimi FA 2000.001.203.jpg|thumb| Engraving by Pieter Van Sompel, before 1643; After [[Pieter Soutman]] ]]\n[[File:Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (Paracelsus).

Above and below the image are the mottos \n''Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest'' (\"Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself\") and ''Omne donum perfectum a Deo, inperfectum a Diabolo'' (\"All perfect gifts are from God, [all] imperfect [ones] from the Devil\"); later portraits give a German rendition in two rhyming couplets (''Eines andern Knecht soll Niemand sein / der f\u00fcr sich bleiben kann allein /all gute Gaben sint von Got / des Teufels aber sein Spot'').<ref>Werneck in ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur praktischen Heilkunde: mit vorz\u00fcglicher Ber\u00fccksichtigung der medicinischen Geographie, Topographie und Epidemiologie'', Volume 3 (1836), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wW8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA214&lpg=PA212 212\u2013216].\n''Neues Journal zur Litteratur und Kunstgeschichte'', Volume 2 (1799), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iEdMAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q&f=false 246\u2013256].</ref>\nPosthumous portraits of Paracelsus, made for publications of his books during the second half of the 16th century, often show him in the same pose, holding his sword by its pommel.\n\nThe so-called \"Rosicrucian portrait\", published with '' Philosophiae magnae Paracelsi'' (Heirs of Arnold Birckmann, Cologne, 1567), is closely based on the 1540 portrait by Hirschvogel (but mirrored, so that now Paracelsus's left hand rests on the sword pommel), adding a variety of additional elements: the pommel of the sword is inscribed by ''[[Azoth]]'', and next to the figure of Paracelsus, the [[Bombast von Hohenheim]] arms are shown (with an additional border of eight [[cross patty|crosses patty]]).<ref>\nThe von Hohenheim arms showed a blue (azure) bend with three white (argent) balls in a yellow (or) field (Julius Kindler von Knobloch, ''Oberbadisches Geschlechterbuch'' vol. 1, 1894, [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/kindlervonknobloch1898bd1/0146 p. 142]), i.e. without the border. Franz Hartmann, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeanddoctrine00hartgoog Life and Doctrines]'' (1887), [https://archive.org/details/lifeanddoctrine00hartgoog p. 12] describes the \narms shown on the monument in St Sebastian church, Salzburg as  \"a beam of silver, upon which are ranged three black balls\".</ref>\nShown in the background are \"early [[Rosicrucian]] symbols\", including the head of a child protruding from the ground (indicating rebirth). The portrait is possibly a work by [[Frans Hogenberg]], acting under the directions of Theodor Birckmann (1531/33\u20131586).\n\n===Paracelsianism and Rosicrucianism===\n{{see|Paracelsianism}}\n\nParacelsus was especially venerated by German [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]], who regarded him as a prophet, and developed a field of systematic study of his writings, which is sometimes called \"[[Paracelsianism]]\", or more rarely \"Paracelsism\". [[Francis Bacon]] warned against Paracelsus and the Rosicrucians, judging that \"the ancient opinion that man was ''microcosmus''\"  had been \"fantastically strained by Paracelsus and the alchemists\".<ref>F.A. Yates, ''Rosicrucian Enlightenment'' (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXFHAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA120 p. 120].</ref>\n\n\"Paracelsism\" also produced the first complete edition of Paracelsus's works. Johannes Huser of [[Basel]] (c. 1545\u20131604) gathered autographs and manuscript copies, and prepared an edition in ten volumes during 1589\u20131591.<ref>Huser quart edition (medicinal and philosophical treatises), ten volumes, Basel, 1589\u20131591; Huser's edition of Paracelsus's surgical works was published posthumously in Strasbourg, 1605.</ref>\n\nThe prophecies contained in Paracelsus's works on astrology and divination began to be separately edited as ''Prognosticon Theophrasti Paracelsi'' in the early 17th century. His prediction of a \"great calamity just beginning\" indicating the [[End Times]] was later associated with the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the identification of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] as the \"Lion from the North\" is based in one of Paracelsus's \"prognostications\" referencing [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 5:6.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''Apocalypses: Prophecies, Cults, and Millennial Beliefs Through the Ages'' (2000),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=nz5m0vZHYx8C&pg=PA86 p. 86].</ref>\n\n[[Carl Gustav Jung]] studied Paracelsus intensively. His work ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis|Mysterium Conjunctionis]]'' further drew from alchemical symbolism as a tool in psychotherapy. Following Paracelsus's path, it was Jung who first theorised that the symbolic language of alchemy was an expression of innate but unconscious psychological processes.\n\n===In literature and drama===\nA number of fictionalised depictions of Paracelsus have been published in modern literature. The first presentation of Paracelsus's life in the form of a [[historical novel]] was published in 1830 by Diocl\u00e8s Fabre d'Olivet (1811\u20131848, son of [[Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]]),<ref>''Un m\u00e9decin d'autrefois.

Meinrad Lienert, \"Der Hexenmeister\" in: ''Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten'', Stuttgart (1915).</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Schnitzler]] wrote a verse play  ''Paracelsus'' in 1899. [[Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer]] wrote a novel trilogy (''Paracelsus-Trilogie''), published during 1917\u201326. Martha Sills-Fuchs (1896\u20131987) wrote three ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' plays with Paracelsus as the main character during 1936\u20131939 in which Paracelsus is depicted as the prophetic healer of the [[German people]].<ref>Udo Benzenh\u00f6fer, \"Die Paracelsus-Dramen der Martha Sills-Fuchs im Unfeld des 'Vereins Deutsche Volksheilkunde' Julius Streichers\" in Peter Dilg, Hartmut Rudolph (eds.), ''Resultate und Desiderate der Paracelsus-Forschun'' (1993, 163\u201381.</ref> \nThe [[cinema of Germany|German]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Paracelsus (film)|Paracelsus]]'' was made in [[1943 in film|1943]], directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37218/Paracelsus/details |title=NY Times: Paracelsus |accessdate=2009-09-13|work=NY Times}}</ref> Also in 1943, Richard Billinger wrote a play ''Paracelsus'' for the [[Salzburg Festival]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6oiD85C9HzUC&pg=PA73 p. 73].</ref>\n\n[[Mika Waltari]]'s ''[[Mikael Karvajalka]]'' (1948) has a scene fictionalising Paracelsus's acquisition of his legendary sword. Paracelsus is the main character of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story ''La rosa de Paracelso'' (anthologized in ''[[Shakespeare's Memory (short story collection)|Shakespeare's Memory]]'', 1983). An alchemist based on him named Van Hohenheim is one of the main characters of the manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''. The Rose of Paracelsus: On Secrets and Sacraments, borrowing from Jorge Luis Borges, is also a novel by [[William Leonard Pickard]].<ref>http://www.oaktreereview.com/indigos-delivery-an-excerpt-from-the-rose-of-paracelsus/</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{wikisourcelang-inline|de|Paracelsus}}\n{{library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|viaf=12313247}}\n[[File:Aurora thesaurusque philosophorum 1577 title page.jpg|thumb|right|''Aurora thesaurusque philosophorum'', 1577]]\nBecause of the work of [[Karl Widemann]], who copied over 30 years the work of Paracelsus, many unpublished works survived.\n\n; Published during his lifetime\n* ''De gradibus et compositionibus receptorum naturalim'', 1526.\n* ''Vom Holtz Guaico'' (on [[guaiacum]]), [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10164508_00005.html 1529].\n* ''Practica, gemacht auff Europen'' [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10198676_00005.html 1529]. \n* ''Von der Frantz\u00f6sischen kranckheit Drey B\u00fccher'' (on [[syphilis]]), 1530.\n* ''Von den wunderbarlichen zeychen, so in vier jaren einander nach im Hymmelgewelcke und Luft ersehen'' [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0004/bsb00049983/images/index.html?seite=00001&l=de 1534]\n* ''Von der Bergsucht oder Bergkranckheiten'' (on miners' diseases), 1534.\n* ''Vonn dem Bad Pfeffers in Oberschwytz gelegen'' ([[Pf\u00e4fers Abbey|Pf\u00e4fers baths]]), 1535.\n* ''Praktica Teutsch auff das 1535 Jar '' [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10198898_00003.html 1535]\n* ''Die gro\u00dfe Wundarzney'' (\"Great Book of Surgery\"),  Ulm 1536 (Hans Varnier); Augsburg 1536 (Haynrich Stayner (=Steyner)),  Frankfurt 1536 (Georg Raben/ Weygand Hanen).\n* ''Prognosticatio Ad Vigesimum Quartum annum duratura '' [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0001/bsb00012441/images/index.html?id=00012441&groesser=&fip=qrsweayaeayafsdrwxdsydenen&no=2&seite=4 1536]\n\n; Posthumous publications\n\n* ''Wundt unnd Leibartznei''.

As the hardest known naturally occurring substance when the scale was designed, [[diamond]]s are at the top of the scale. The hardness of a material is measured against the scale by finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, or the softest material that can scratch the given material. For example, if some material is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on the Mohs scale would fall between 4 and 5.<ref>American Federation of Mineralogical Societies. [http://www.amfed.org/t_mohs.htm \"Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness\"]. amfed.org</ref> \"Scratching\" a material for the purposes of the Mohs scale means creating non-elastic dislocations visible to the naked eye. Frequently, materials that are lower on the Mohs scale can create microscopic, non-elastic dislocations on materials that have a higher Mohs number. While these microscopic dislocations are permanent and sometimes detrimental to the harder material's structural integrity, they are not considered \"scratches\" for the determination of a Mohs scale number.<ref>Geels, Kay.

Struers A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark</ref>\n\nThe Mohs scale is a purely [[ordinal scale]]. For example, [[corundum]] (9) is twice as hard as [[topaz]] (8), but diamond (10) is four times as hard as corundum.

[http://www.amfed.org/t_mohs.htm \"Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness\"]. amfed.org</ref> \"Scratching\" a material for the purposes of the Mohs scale means creating non-elastic dislocations visible to the naked eye. Frequently, materials that are lower on the Mohs scale can create microscopic, non-elastic dislocations on materials that have a higher Mohs number. While these microscopic dislocations are permanent and sometimes detrimental to the harder material's structural integrity, they are not considered \"scratches\" for the determination of a Mohs scale number.<ref>Geels, Kay. [http://www.struers.com/resources/elements/12/2474/35art2.pdf \"The True Microstructure of Materials\"], pp. 5\u201313 in ''Materialographic Preparation from Sorby to the Present''. Struers A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark</ref>\n\nThe Mohs scale is a purely [[ordinal scale]]. For example, [[corundum]] (9) is twice as hard as [[topaz]] (8), but diamond (10) is four times as hard as corundum. The table below shows the comparison with the absolute hardness measured by a [[sclerometer]], with pictorial examples.<ref>Amethyst Galleries' Mineral Gallery [https://web.archive.org/web/20061230174242/http://www.galleries.com/minerals/hardness.htm What is important about hardness?]. galleries.com</ref><ref>[http://www.inlandlapidary.com/user_area/hardness.asp Mineral Hardness and Hardness Scales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017152845/http://www.inlandlapidary.com/user_area/hardness.asp |date=2008-10-17 }}.
