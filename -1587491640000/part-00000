The name refers to its executable filename.  It is also commonly referred to as '''cmd''' or the '''Command Prompt''', referring to the default window title on Windows.  The implementations differ on the various systems but the behavior and basic set of commands is generally consistent.  {{mono|cmd.exe}} is the counterpart of {{mono|[[COMMAND.COM]]}} in [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] systems, and analogous to the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for [[Windows NT]] was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/>\n[[Windows CE 2.11]] was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of {{mono|cmd.exe}}.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Douglas McConnaughey Boling|year=2001|title=Programming Microsoft Windows CE|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-0735614437}}</ref>\nOn [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10)|title=Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2)|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925(v%3dmsdn.10)|title=Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0)|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728(v%3dwinembedded.60)|title=Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0)|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.\nThe ReactOS implementation of {{mono|cmd.exe}} is derived from FreeCOM, the [[FreeDOS]] command line interpreter.<ref name=\"ReactOS\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)\n\nMultiple commands can be processed in a single command line using the command separator {{mono|&&}}.<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd|title=cmd|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref>\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nC:\\>CommandA && CommandB && CommandC\n</source>\n\nOn [[Windows XP]] or later, the maximum length of the string that can be used at the command prompt is 8191 characters.

than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history.

The name refers to its executable filename.  It is also commonly referred to as '''cmd''' or the '''Command Prompt''', referring to the default window title on Windows.  The implementations differ on the various systems but the behavior and basic set of commands is generally consistent.  {{mono|cmd.exe}} is the counterpart of {{mono|[[COMMAND.COM]]}} in [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] systems, and analogous to the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. The initial version of {{mono|cmd.exe}} for [[Windows NT]] was developed by Therese Stowell.<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\"/>\n[[Windows CE 2.11]] was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of {{mono|cmd.exe}}.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Douglas McConnaughey Boling|year=2001|title=Programming Microsoft Windows CE|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-0735614437}}</ref>\nOn [[Windows CE .NET 4.2]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms879823(v%3dmsdn.10)|title=Command Processor Shell (Windows CE .NET 4.2)|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref> [[Windows CE 5.0]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/aa453925(v%3dmsdn.10)|title=Command Processor Shell (Windows CE 5.0)|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref> and [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ee499728(v%3dwinembedded.60)|title=Command Processor Shell (Windows Embedded CE 6.0)|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref> it is also referred to as '''Command Processor Shell'''.\nThe ReactOS implementation of {{mono|cmd.exe}} is derived from FreeCOM, the [[FreeDOS]] command line interpreter.<ref name=\"ReactOS\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{mono|cmd.exe}} interacts with the user through a [[command-line interface]]. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the [[standard error stream]]. ({{mono|COMMAND.COM}} uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)\n\nMultiple commands can be processed in a single command line using the command separator {{mono|&&}}.<ref name=\"docs.microsoft.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd|title=cmd|website=docs.microsoft.com}}</ref>\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nC:\\>CommandA && CommandB && CommandC\n</source>\n\nOn [[Windows XP]] or later, the maximum length of the string that can be used at the command prompt is 8191 characters.

This is Gorka's fifth album and unlike the previous four recorded in various places in the [[northeastern United States]], ''Out of the Valley'' was recorded at [[Imagine Sound Studios]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  This is also the first of several Gorka albums to employ the talents of guitarist/producer [[John Jennings (musician)|John Jennings]].\n\nGuest vocalists include [[country music]] superstars [[Kathy Mattea]] and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] among others.  Guest instrumentalists include guitarist [[Leo Kottke]], [[Fairport Convention]] drummer [[Dave Mattacks]], and bluegrass virtuosos [[Jerry Douglas]] and [[Tim O'Brien (musician)|Tim O'Brien]].  A notable absence is the voice of [[Lucy Kaplansky]] whose background vocals have been a feature of all other Gorka albums.\n\nThis is perhaps Gorka's most commercial album and is his only work to have ranked on one of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' charts.  It peaked at # 26 on the \"[[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]]\" chart.  Reactions to the increased level of commercial production in Gorka's folk music were varied.

This is Gorka's fifth album and unlike the previous four recorded in various places in the [[northeastern United States]], ''Out of the Valley'' was recorded at [[Imagine Sound Studios]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

A notable absence is the voice of [[Lucy Kaplansky]] whose background vocals have been a feature of all other Gorka albums.\n\nThis is perhaps Gorka's most commercial album and is his only work to have ranked on one of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' charts.  It peaked at # 26 on the \"[[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]]\" chart.  Reactions to the increased level of commercial production in Gorka's folk music were varied.

blight]] is one of the most evidence-based and cost-effective ways to manage the disease. Using varieties that have looser tusks that cover the ear are less vulnerable to [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]]. Once the crop has been harvested, it is essential to store it at low moisture, below 15%, as this will reduce the appearance of ''Gibberella zeae'' and ''Fusarium'' species in storage.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAvoiding the planting of small grain crops following other small grain crops or corn and tillage of crop residue minimizes the chances of [[Fusarium head blight]] in environmentally favorable years. The rotation of small grains with soybean or other non-host crops has proven to reduce [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] and mycotoxin contamination.<ref name=\":2\" /> Crop rotation with the tillage of residue prevents crops from remaining to infect on the soil surface. Residues can provide an overwintering medium for ''Fusarium'' species to cause [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]]. As a result, the chances of infection are greatly improved in the succeeding small grain crop.<ref name=\":2\" /> If minimal or no tillage occurs, the residue spreads and allows the fungus to overwinter on stalks and rotted ears of corn and produce spores.\n\nThe seeds (kernels) that colonize with the fungus have less resistance because of poor germination. Planting certified or treated seeds can reduce the amount of seedling blight, which is caused by the seeds colonized with the fungus. If it is necessary to replant seeds that were harvested from a [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] infected field, then the seeds should be treated to avoid reoccurrence of the infection.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Importance ==\nThe loss of yield and contamination of seed with [[mycotoxin]]s, alongside reduced seed quality, are the main contributions to the impact of this disease. Two [[mycotoxin]]s, trichothecene [[Vomitoxin|deoxynivalenol]], a strong biosynthesis inhibitor, and [[zearalenone]], an estrogenic mycotoxin, can be found in grains after [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] epidemics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guenther|first=John C.|last2=Trail|first2=Frances|date=2005|title=The Development and Differentiation of Gibberella zeae (Anamorph: Fusarium graminearum) during Colonization of Wheat|jstor=3762213|journal=Mycologia|volume=97|issue=1|pages=229\u2013237|doi=10.1080/15572536.2006.11832856}}</ref> [[Vomitoxin|Deoxynivalenol]] is a type of [[vomitoxin]] and, as its name states, is an antifeedant. Livestock that consume crops contaminated with vomitoxin become sick and refuse to eat anymore. [[Zearalenone]] is a [[Phytoestrogens|phytoestrogen]], mimicking mammals' estrogen. It can be disastrous if it gets into the food chain, as [[zearalenone]] causes abortions in pregnant females and [[Feminization (biology)|feminization]] of males.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/aug2005.html|title=Gibberella zeae or Fusarium graminearum, head blight of wheat|last=Volk|first=Tom|date=|website=botit.botany.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, a major epidemic affected 4 million hectares of the spring wheat and barely growing in the northern Great Plains of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. The yield losses exceeded 6.5 million tons worth approximately $826 million, with total losses related to the epidemic near one billion dollars.<ref name=\":1\" /> Years that followed this epidemic, reported losses that have been estimated between $200-$400 million annually. Losses in barley because of [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] are large in part due to the presence of deoxynivalenol.

These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against ''F. graminearum'', no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of ''F. graminearum'' is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.\n\n== Life cycle ==\n''F. graminearum'' is a haploid homothallic ascomycete. The fruiting bodies, [[perithecia]], develop on the [[mycelium]] and give rise to [[ascospores]], which land on susceptible parts of the host plant to germinate. The fungus causes fusarium head blight on wheat, barley, and other grass species, as well as [[fusarium ear blight|ear rot]] on corn. The primary inocula are the ascospores, sexual spores which are produced in the perithecia.<ref>Beyer M, Verreet J-A (2005): Germination of ''Gibberella zeae'' ascospores as affected by age of spores after discharge and environmental factors. European Journal of Plant Pathology 111: 381-389. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10658-004-6470-9]</ref> Spores are forcibly discharged and can germinate within six hours upon landing on the plant surface. The scab disease is monocyclic; after one cycle of infection with ascospores, the fungus produces [[macroconidia]] by asexual reproduction.<ref>Beyer M, R\u00f6ding S, Ludewig A, Verreet J-A (2004): Germination and survival of ''Fusarium graminearum'' macroconidia as affected by environmental factors.

The infection occurs by colonizing [[corn silk]] and symptoms first occur at the ear's apex. The white [[mycelium]] turns from pink to red over time, eventually covering the entire ear. Ears that become infected early don't fully develop the reddish mold near the ear tip, as the mold grows between the husks and ear.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Rice'''\n\n''Gibberella zeae ''can turn affected seeds red and cause brown discoloration in certain areas on the seed or the entire seed surface. The surface of husks develop white spots that later become yellow and salmon or carmine. Infected grains are light, shrunken and brittle. Stem nodes begin to rot and wilt, eventually causing them to turn black and disintegrate when they are infected by the fungal pathogen.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Wheat'''\n\nBrown, dark purple-black necrotic lesions will form on the outer surface of the spikelets, what the wheat ear breaks up into. The lesions may be referred to as scabs, but this is not to be confused and associated with other scab diseases such as those with different host and pathogen. Head blight is visible before the spikes mature.<ref name=\":1\" /> Spikelets begin to appear water-soaked before the loss of chlorophyll, which gives a white straw color. [[Peduncle (botany)|Peduncles]] that are directly under the [[inflorescence]] can become discolored into a brown-purple color. Tissues of the [[inflorescence]] typically become blighted into a bleached tan appearance, and the grain within it atrophies.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Awn (botany)|awn]] will become deformed, twisted and curve in a downward direction.\n\n'''Barley'''\n\nInfections on barley are not always visible in the field. Similar to wheat, infected spikelets show a browning or water-soaked appearance. The infected kernels display a tan to dark brown discoloration. During long periods of wetness, pink to salmon-orange spore masses can be seen on the infected spikelets and kernels.<ref name=\":0\" /> The cortical lesions of infected seeds become a reddish-brown in cool, moist soil. Warm soil can cause head blight to occur after emergence, and crown and basal culm rot can be observed in later plant development.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Infection process ==\n[[Image:Wheat scab.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Wheat scab caused by ''G. zeae'' (artificial inoculation)]]\n''F. graminearum'' infects wheat spikes from anthesis through the soft dough stage of kernel development. The fungus enters the plant mostly through the flowers; however, the infection process is complex and the complete course of colonization of the host has not been described. [[Germ tube]]s seem not to be able to penetrate the hard, waxy surface of the lemma and palea which protect the flower. The fungus enters the plant through natural openings such as stomates, and needs soft tissue such as the flowers, anthers and embryo to infect the plant.<ref>Bushnell WR, Leonard KJ (2003): Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley.APS Press, St. Paul, Minnesota</ref> From the infected floret, the fungus can grow through the rachis and cause severe damage in a short period of time under favorable conditions. Upon germination of the spores on the anthers and the surface of the developing kernel, hyphae penetrate the epicarp and spread through the seed coat. Successively, the different layers of the seed coat and finally the [[endosperm]] are colonized and killed.<ref>Jansen C, Von Wettstein D, Sch\u00e4fer W, Kogel K-H, Felk A, Maier FJ (2005): Infection patterns in barley and wheat spikes inoculated with wild-type and trichodiene synthase gene disrupted ''Fusarium graminearum''.

The correct usage of fungicide applications against [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] can reduce the disease by 50 to 60 percent.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/3102/3102-1535/3102-1535.html|title=Managing Fusarium Head Blight in Virginia Small Grains|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en}}</ref> ''Fusarium'' refers to a large genus of soil fungi that are economically important due to the profound effects they have on crops. Application of fungicides is necessary at early heading date for barley and early flowering for wheat, where the early application can limit the infection of the ear. Barley and wheat differ in fungicide application because of their differences in developmental traits.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alqudah|first=Ahmad M.|last2=Schnurbusch|first2=Thorsten|date=2017-05-30|title=Heading Date Is Not Flowering Time in Spring Barley|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|volume=8|pages=896|doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.00896|issn=1664-462X|pmc=5447769|pmid=28611811}}</ref> The disease generally develops late in the season or during storage, so fungicide use is only effective in the early season. Management against insect pests such as ear borers, for corn, will also reduce the infection of the ear from wounds caused by insect feeding.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://maizedoctor.org/fusarium-and-gibberella-ear-rot-extended-information|title=Fusarium and gibberella ear rot (extended information)|last=User|first=Super|website=maizedoctor.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306131829/http://maizedoctor.org/fusarium-and-gibberella-ear-rot-extended-information|archive-date=2018-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCultivating a variety of hosts that are resistant to [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] is one of the most evidence-based and cost-effective ways to manage the disease. Using varieties that have looser tusks that cover the ear are less vulnerable to [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]]. Once the crop has been harvested, it is essential to store it at low moisture, below 15%, as this will reduce the appearance of ''Gibberella zeae'' and ''Fusarium'' species in storage.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAvoiding the planting of small grain crops following other small grain crops or corn and tillage of crop residue minimizes the chances of [[Fusarium head blight]] in environmentally favorable years. The rotation of small grains with soybean or other non-host crops has proven to reduce [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] and mycotoxin contamination.<ref name=\":2\" /> Crop rotation with the tillage of residue prevents crops from remaining to infect on the soil surface. Residues can provide an overwintering medium for ''Fusarium'' species to cause [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]]. As a result, the chances of infection are greatly improved in the succeeding small grain crop.<ref name=\":2\" /> If minimal or no tillage occurs, the residue spreads and allows the fungus to overwinter on stalks and rotted ears of corn and produce spores.\n\nThe seeds (kernels) that colonize with the fungus have less resistance because of poor germination. Planting certified or treated seeds can reduce the amount of seedling blight, which is caused by the seeds colonized with the fungus. If it is necessary to replant seeds that were harvested from a [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] infected field, then the seeds should be treated to avoid reoccurrence of the infection.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Importance ==\nThe loss of yield and contamination of seed with [[mycotoxin]]s, alongside reduced seed quality, are the main contributions to the impact of this disease. Two [[mycotoxin]]s, trichothecene [[Vomitoxin|deoxynivalenol]], a strong biosynthesis inhibitor, and [[zearalenone]], an estrogenic mycotoxin, can be found in grains after [[Fusarium ear blight|Fusarium head blight]] epidemics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guenther|first=John C.|last2=Trail|first2=Frances|date=2005|title=The Development and Differentiation of Gibberella zeae (Anamorph: Fusarium graminearum) during Colonization of Wheat|jstor=3762213|journal=Mycologia|volume=97|issue=1|pages=229\u2013237|doi=10.1080/15572536.2006.11832856}}</ref> [[Vomitoxin|Deoxynivalenol]] is a type of [[vomitoxin]] and, as its name states, is an antifeedant.

It can be disastrous if it gets into the food chain, as [[zearalenone]] causes abortions in pregnant females and [[Feminization (biology)|feminization]] of males.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/aug2005.html|title=Gibberella zeae or Fusarium graminearum, head blight of wheat|last=Volk|first=Tom|date=|website=botit.botany.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, a major epidemic affected 4 million hectares of the spring wheat and barely growing in the northern Great Plains of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.
