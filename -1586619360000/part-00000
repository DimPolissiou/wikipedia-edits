He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977, and then as the \"[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader]]\" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].\n\n<!--Early life and the republic--> \nBorn near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the [[Western world|Western]]-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments\u2014particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdel Nasser's]] Egypt\u2014he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted \"[[Islamic socialism]]\". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a \"[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]\" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.\n\n<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (\"state of the masses\") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and [[United Nations]]\u2013imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic [[privatization]], rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]], and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.\n\n<!--Legacy and assessment:-->\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab\u2014and then African\u2014unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse. He was condemned by many as a [[dictator]] whose authoritarian administration violated [[Human rights in Libya|human rights]] and financed global [[terrorism]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: to 1950===\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi<ref name=\"iccwarrant\">{{cite web |title=The Prosecutor v.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977, and then as the \"[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader]]\" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].\n\n<!--Early life and the republic--> \nBorn near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the [[Western world|Western]]-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments\u2014particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdel Nasser's]] Egypt\u2014he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted \"[[Islamic socialism]]\". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a \"[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]\" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.\n\n<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (\"state of the masses\") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and [[United Nations]]\u2013imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic [[privatization]], rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]], and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.\n\n<!--Legacy and assessment:-->\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab\u2014and then African\u2014unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse.

Her case, with a [[pseudonym]] used, was depicted in the 1950s book ''[[The Three Faces of Eve]],'' written by her [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]s, [[Corbett H. Thigpen]] and [[Hervey M.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]].

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]].

The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings.

Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]].

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]].

While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species which we do not yet describe as \"minded\" at all, and about whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities.\n\nFor example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.\n\nThere has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability\u2014or inability\u2014in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990)<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_asie/143| journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u2013210 | pmid = 2225758 }}</ref> presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from which to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the \"knower.\" By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139\u2013151 | pmid = 11170704 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 }}</ref> found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.\n\nTomasello and like-minded colleagues who originally argued that great apes did not have theory of mind have since reversed their position. Povinelli and his colleagues, however, maintain that Tomasello's group has misinterpreted the results of their experiments. They point out that most evidence in support of great ape theory of mind involves naturalistic settings to which the apes may have already adapted through past learning. Their \"reinterpretation hypothesis\" explains away all current evidence supporting attribution of mental states to others in chimpanzees as merely evidence of risk-based learning; that is, the chimpanzees learn through experience that certain behaviors in other chimpanzees have a probability of leading to certain responses, without necessarily attributing knowledge or other intentional states to those other chimpanzees. They therefore propose testing theory of mind abilities in great apes in novel, and not naturalistic settings. Kristin Andrews takes the reinterpretation hypothesis one step further, arguing that it implies that even the well-known [[Sally\u2013Anne test|false-belief test]] used to test children's theory of mind is susceptible to being interpreted as a result of learning.\n\n===Language===\nThe modelling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research. There have been many examples of modelling of human language through entrainment in primates. Most notably are [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee; [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla and [[Kanzi]], a bonobo.  Cognitive abilities are also demonstrated through the natural communication through vocalizations performed by non-human primates in the wild, with sophisticated systems of alarm calls and emotional vocalizations as well as adaptive behavioural responses to other animal's calls.\n\n==== Modeling of human language ====\nThe experiment called Project Nim was one of the first experiments that aimed to show nonhuman primates could be taught a human form of language. The experiment conducted on the chimpanzee dubbed \"[[Nim Chimpsky]]\" took place in the 1970s and was the idea of [[Herbert S. Terrace|Herbet S. Terrace]], to try to disprove the notion put forth by [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom the chimp was named, stating that language is an exclusively human ability. Nim was taught 125 signs in his life, and constantly impressed those he met with his ability to seemingly understand human nature and his mischievous behaviours. Similar experiments took place on two other primates, Koko and Kanzi. Koko was able to learn many signs, as well as some novel vocalizations to indicate emotional state. Kanzi learned to model human language in an entirely different way. He was able to learn 348 geometrical symbols that represented different words, and to combine symbols in a type of proto-grammar to convey meaning and understanding. His keepers also claim that he understands the meaning of up to 3,000 human words. These examples of stunning cognition demonstrate the near-human ability of some trained primates to learn and retain the ability to communicate with humans.{{Citation needed|reason=There is controversy over whether observed primate sign language is a Clever Hans effect|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Communication in the wild ====\nCommunication of animals in the wild has been studied extensively. Calls with specific intent, such as alarm calls or mating calls has been observed in many orders of animals, including primates.  A study done on East African [[Vervet monkey]]s showed that in the wild this species was able to produce at least 5 acoustically different alarm calls in response to danger, and that other monkeys responded differently according to which alarm had been sounded. This indicated a clear communication that there is a predator nearby and what kind of predator it is, eliciting a specific response.  A different species of monkeys, the wild Campbell's monkeys have also been known to produce a sequence of vocalization that require a specific order to elicit a specific behaviour in other monkeys. Changing the order of the sounds changes the resulting behaviour, or meaning, of the call. [[Diana monkey]]s were studied in a habituation-dishabituation experiment that demonstrated the ability to attend to the semantic content of calls rather than simply to acoustic nature.  Primates have also been observed responding to alarm calls of other species. [[Crested guineafowl|Crested Guinea fowl]], a ground-dwelling fowl, produce a single type of alarm call for all predators it detects. Diana monkeys have been observed to respond to the most likely reason for the call, typically a human or leopard, based on the situation and respond according to that. If they deem a leopard is the more likely predator in the vicinity they will produce their own leopard-specific alarm call but if they think it is a human, they will remain silent and hidden.\n\n===Tool use===\n{{further|Tool use by animals#Primates}}\n[[File:Gorrila tool use-Efi.jpg|thumb|Tool use by a gorilla]]\nThere are many reports of primates making or using tools, both in the wild or when captive. [[Chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[capuchin monkeys]], [[baboons]], and [[mandrills]] have all been reported as using tools. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7922109.stm Chimpanzee making and using a termite \"fishing rod\"]</ref> fish), collecting honey,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7949335.stm Chimpanzee using tool to break into beehive to get honey]</ref> processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.\n\nTool making is much rarer, but has been documented in orangutans,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Schaik | first1 = C. | last2 = Fox | first2 = E. | last3 = Sitompul | first3 = A. | year = 1996 | title = Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 186\u2013188 | doi=10.1007/s001140050271}}</ref> [[bonobo]]s and [[bearded capuchin]] monkeys.

Some studies suggest primates could use tools due to environmental or motivational clues, rather than an understanding of [[folk physics]] or a capacity for future planning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Tool use and physical cognition in birds and mammals | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201333 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.02.003}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving===\nIn 1913, [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] started writing a book on problem solving titled ''The Mentality of Apes'' (1917). In this research, K\u00f6hler observed the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms.\n\nK\u00f6hler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through [[trial-and-error]] (which American psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] had claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his [[law of effect]]), but rather that they had experienced an [[insight]] (sometimes known as the [[Eureka effect]] or an \"aha\" experience), in which, having realized the answer, they then proceeded to carry it out in a way that was, in K\u00f6hler's words, \"unwaveringly purposeful.\"\n\n===Asking questions and giving negative answers===\nIn the 1970s and the 1980s there had been suggestions that apes are unable to ask questions and to give negative answers.  According to numerous published studies, apes are able to answer human questions, and the vocabulary of the acculturated apes contains question words.<ref>Terrace, H. S. 1980. ''Nim''.

New York: Holt, Renchart and Winston.</ref> Despite these abilities, according to the published research literature, apes are not able to ask questions themselves, and in human-primate conversations questions are asked by the humans only. Ann and David Premacks designed a potentially promising methodology to teach apes to ask questions in the 1970s: \"In principle interrogation can be taught either by removing an element from a familiar situation in the animal's world or by removing the element from a language that maps the animal's world. It is probable that one can induce questions by purposefully removing key elements from a familiar situation. Suppose a chimpanzee received its daily ration of food at a specific time and place, and then one day the food was not there. A chimpanzee trained in the interrogative might inquire \"Where is my food?\" or, in Sarah's case, \"My food is?\" Sarah was never put in a situation that might induce such interrogation because for our purposes it was easier to teach Sarah to answer questions\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1972) \"[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/terrace/w1001/readings/premack.pdf Teaching language to an ape].\"  ''[[Scientific American]]'', Vol. 227, No. 4.  W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref>\n\nA decade later Premacks wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions\u2014unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1983) ''The mind of an ape''. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company. Pg. 29</ref>\n\nDespite all their achievements, Kanzi and Panbanisha also have not demonstrated the ability to ask questions so far. [[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that the ability to ask [[question]]s could be the crucial cognitive threshold between [[human]] and other [[ape]] mental abilities.<ref>J. Jordania, ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]'', Logos, 2006</ref> Jordania suggested that asking questions is not a matter of the ability of using syntactic structures, that it is primarily a matter of cognitive ability.\n\n==''g'' factor of intelligence in primates==\n{{main|g factor in non-humans}}\nThe general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual\u2019s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.<ref name=\"Reader\">{{cite journal |last1=Reader |first1=S.

W. (2005). \"Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence.\" Springer Science & Business Media.</ref>\n\nHowever, there is some debate as to the influence of ''g'' on all primates equally.

While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species which we do not yet describe as \"minded\" at all, and about whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities.\n\nFor example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.\n\nThere has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability\u2014or inability\u2014in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990)<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_asie/143| journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u2013210 | pmid = 2225758 }}</ref> presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from which to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the \"knower.\" By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139\u2013151 | pmid = 11170704 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 }}</ref> found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.\n\nTomasello and like-minded colleagues who originally argued that great apes did not have theory of mind have since reversed their position. Povinelli and his colleagues, however, maintain that Tomasello's group has misinterpreted the results of their experiments. They point out that most evidence in support of great ape theory of mind involves naturalistic settings to which the apes may have already adapted through past learning. Their \"reinterpretation hypothesis\" explains away all current evidence supporting attribution of mental states to others in chimpanzees as merely evidence of risk-based learning; that is, the chimpanzees learn through experience that certain behaviors in other chimpanzees have a probability of leading to certain responses, without necessarily attributing knowledge or other intentional states to those other chimpanzees. They therefore propose testing theory of mind abilities in great apes in novel, and not naturalistic settings. Kristin Andrews takes the reinterpretation hypothesis one step further, arguing that it implies that even the well-known [[Sally\u2013Anne test|false-belief test]] used to test children's theory of mind is susceptible to being interpreted as a result of learning.\n\n===Language===\nThe modelling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research. There have been many examples of modelling of human language through entrainment in primates. Most notably are [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee; [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla and [[Kanzi]], a bonobo.  Cognitive abilities are also demonstrated through the natural communication through vocalizations performed by non-human primates in the wild, with sophisticated systems of alarm calls and emotional vocalizations as well as adaptive behavioural responses to other animal's calls.\n\n==== Modeling of human language ====\nThe experiment called Project Nim was one of the first experiments that aimed to show nonhuman primates could be taught a human form of language. The experiment conducted on the chimpanzee dubbed \"[[Nim Chimpsky]]\" took place in the 1970s and was the idea of [[Herbert S. Terrace|Herbet S. Terrace]], to try to disprove the notion put forth by [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom the chimp was named, stating that language is an exclusively human ability. Nim was taught 125 signs in his life, and constantly impressed those he met with his ability to seemingly understand human nature and his mischievous behaviours. Similar experiments took place on two other primates, Koko and Kanzi. Koko was able to learn many signs, as well as some novel vocalizations to indicate emotional state. Kanzi learned to model human language in an entirely different way. He was able to learn 348 geometrical symbols that represented different words, and to combine symbols in a type of proto-grammar to convey meaning and understanding. His keepers also claim that he understands the meaning of up to 3,000 human words. These examples of stunning cognition demonstrate the near-human ability of some trained primates to learn and retain the ability to communicate with humans.{{Citation needed|reason=There is controversy over whether observed primate sign language is a Clever Hans effect|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Communication in the wild ====\nCommunication of animals in the wild has been studied extensively. Calls with specific intent, such as alarm calls or mating calls has been observed in many orders of animals, including primates.  A study done on East African [[Vervet monkey]]s showed that in the wild this species was able to produce at least 5 acoustically different alarm calls in response to danger, and that other monkeys responded differently according to which alarm had been sounded. This indicated a clear communication that there is a predator nearby and what kind of predator it is, eliciting a specific response.  A different species of monkeys, the wild Campbell's monkeys have also been known to produce a sequence of vocalization that require a specific order to elicit a specific behaviour in other monkeys. Changing the order of the sounds changes the resulting behaviour, or meaning, of the call. [[Diana monkey]]s were studied in a habituation-dishabituation experiment that demonstrated the ability to attend to the semantic content of calls rather than simply to acoustic nature.  Primates have also been observed responding to alarm calls of other species. [[Crested guineafowl|Crested Guinea fowl]], a ground-dwelling fowl, produce a single type of alarm call for all predators it detects. Diana monkeys have been observed to respond to the most likely reason for the call, typically a human or leopard, based on the situation and respond according to that. If they deem a leopard is the more likely predator in the vicinity they will produce their own leopard-specific alarm call but if they think it is a human, they will remain silent and hidden.\n\n===Tool use===\n{{further|Tool use by animals#Primates}}\n[[File:Gorrila tool use-Efi.jpg|thumb|Tool use by a gorilla]]\nThere are many reports of primates making or using tools, both in the wild or when captive. [[Chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[capuchin monkeys]], [[baboons]], and [[mandrills]] have all been reported as using tools. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7922109.stm Chimpanzee making and using a termite \"fishing rod\"]</ref> fish), collecting honey,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7949335.stm Chimpanzee using tool to break into beehive to get honey]</ref> processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.\n\nTool making is much rarer, but has been documented in orangutans,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Schaik | first1 = C. | last2 = Fox | first2 = E. | last3 = Sitompul | first3 = A. | year = 1996 | title = Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 186\u2013188 | doi=10.1007/s001140050271}}</ref> [[bonobo]]s and [[bearded capuchin]] monkeys.

Some studies suggest primates could use tools due to environmental or motivational clues, rather than an understanding of [[folk physics]] or a capacity for future planning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Tool use and physical cognition in birds and mammals | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201333 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.02.003}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving===\nIn 1913, [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] started writing a book on problem solving titled ''The Mentality of Apes'' (1917). In this research, K\u00f6hler observed the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms.\n\nK\u00f6hler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through [[trial-and-error]] (which American psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] had claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his [[law of effect]]), but rather that they had experienced an [[insight]] (sometimes known as the [[Eureka effect]] or an \"aha\" experience), in which, having realized the answer, they then proceeded to carry it out in a way that was, in K\u00f6hler's words, \"unwaveringly purposeful.\"\n\n===Asking questions and giving negative answers===\nIn the 1970s and the 1980s there had been suggestions that apes are unable to ask questions and to give negative answers.  According to numerous published studies, apes are able to answer human questions, and the vocabulary of the acculturated apes contains question words.<ref>Terrace, H. S. 1980. ''Nim''.

New York: Holt, Renchart and Winston.</ref> Despite these abilities, according to the published research literature, apes are not able to ask questions themselves, and in human-primate conversations questions are asked by the humans only. Ann and David Premacks designed a potentially promising methodology to teach apes to ask questions in the 1970s: \"In principle interrogation can be taught either by removing an element from a familiar situation in the animal's world or by removing the element from a language that maps the animal's world. It is probable that one can induce questions by purposefully removing key elements from a familiar situation. Suppose a chimpanzee received its daily ration of food at a specific time and place, and then one day the food was not there. A chimpanzee trained in the interrogative might inquire \"Where is my food?\" or, in Sarah's case, \"My food is?\" Sarah was never put in a situation that might induce such interrogation because for our purposes it was easier to teach Sarah to answer questions\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1972) \"[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/terrace/w1001/readings/premack.pdf Teaching language to an ape].\"  ''[[Scientific American]]'', Vol. 227, No. 4.  W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref>\n\nA decade later Premacks wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions\u2014unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1983) ''The mind of an ape''. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company. Pg. 29</ref>\n\nDespite all their achievements, Kanzi and Panbanisha also have not demonstrated the ability to ask questions so far. [[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that the ability to ask [[question]]s could be the crucial cognitive threshold between [[human]] and other [[ape]] mental abilities.<ref>J. Jordania, ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]'', Logos, 2006</ref> Jordania suggested that asking questions is not a matter of the ability of using syntactic structures, that it is primarily a matter of cognitive ability.\n\n==''g'' factor of intelligence in primates==\n{{main|g factor in non-humans}}\nThe general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual\u2019s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.<ref name=\"Reader\">{{cite journal |last1=Reader |first1=S.

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]].

[[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''.

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]].

[[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]].

{"title_page": "Dependency grammar", "text_new": "{{Linguistics|Grammar}}\n'''Dependency grammar''' ('''DG''') is a class of modern [[Grammar|grammatical]] theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the relation of [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]) and that can be traced back primarily to the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called ''dependencies''. DGs are distinct from [[phrase structure grammar]]s, since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [[Head (linguistics)|head]]) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]] [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]].\n\n==History==\nThe notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries.<ref>Concerning the history of the dependency concept, see Percival (1990).</ref> [[Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be]], a 12th-century [[linguist]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], may have been the first grammarian to use the term ''dependency'' in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of [[term logic]] of antiquity.<ref>Concerning the influence of term logic on the theory of grammar, see Percival (1976).</ref> Dependency is also concretely present in the works of [[S\u00e1muel Brassai]] (1800\u20131897), a Hungarian linguist, [[:de:Franz Kern (Philologe)|Franz Kern]] (1830-1894), a German philologist, and of [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] (1850\u20131936), a Romanian linguist.<ref>Concerning dependency in the works of Brassai, see Imr\u00e9nyi (2013). Concerning dependency in the works of Kern, see Kern's essays (e.g. Kern 1883, 1884). Concerning dependency in the works of Tiktin, see Coseriu (1980).</ref>\n\nModern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Tesni\u00e8re was a Frenchman, a [[polyglot]], and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de syntaxe structurale'' was published posthumously in 1959 \u2013 he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s<ref>Concerning early dependency grammars that may have developed independently of Tesni\u00e8re's work, see for instance Hays (1960), Gaifman (1965), and Robinson (1970).</ref> and a number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works.<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars that were well established by the 1980s are from Hudson (1984), Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et Panevova (1986), Mel\u2019\u010duk (1988), and Starosta (1988).</ref> DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars from the German schools are from Heringer (1996), Engel (1994), Eroms (2000), and \u00c1gel et al. (2003/6) is a massive two volume collection of essays on dependency grammar and valency theory from more than 100 authors.</ref> in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from [[computational linguistics]] and is due, in part, to the influential work that [[David G. Hays|David Hays]] did in machine translation at the [[RAND Corporation]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate [[Treebank|tree banks]]. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ([http://depling.org Depling 2011], [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/depling13/ Depling 2013], [http://depling.org/depling2015/ Depling 2015], [http://www.depling.org/depling2017/call.html Depling 2017], [http://www.depling.org/depling2019/ Depling 2019]).\n\n==Dependency vs. phrase structure==\nDependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there is one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal<ref>The minimality of dependency structures is emphasized, for instance, by Ninio (2006), Hudson 2007: 117, and by Osborne et al. (2011).</ref> compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.\n\n::::[[File:Wearetryingtounderstandthedifference (2).jpg|Dependency vs. phrase structure]]\n\nThese trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an \"ordered\" tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of [[Minimalist program|bare phrase structure]] (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.\n\nThe distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Tesni\u00e8re, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesni\u00e8re's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from [[term logic]] and has no place in linguistics.<ref>Concerning Tesni\u00e8re's rejection of the subject-predicate division of the clause, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:103\u2013105), and for discussion of empirical considerations that support Tesni\u00e8re's point, see Matthews (2007:17ff.), Miller (2011:54ff.), and Osborne et al. (2011:323f.).</ref> The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.\n\n==Dependency grammars==\nThe following frameworks are dependency-based:\n[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|250px|thumb|Hybrid constituency/dependency tree from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]\n\n::* [[Algebraic syntax]]\n::* [[Operator grammar]]\n::* [[Link grammar]]\n::* [[Functional generative description]]\n::* [[Lexicase]]\n::* [[Meaning\u2013text theory]]\n::* [[Word grammar]]\n::* [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~rade/xdg.html Extensible dependency grammar]\n::* [[Universal Dependencies]]\n\n[[Link grammar]] is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes \u2013 see for example the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus|Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank]]. The derivation trees of [[tree-adjoining grammar]] are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.\n\nThere are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.\n\n==Representing dependencies==\nThere are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:\n\n::[[File:Conventions.jpg|Conventions for illustrating dependencies]]\n\nThe representations in (a\u2013d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are ''dependency edges'' and lightly dotted lines are ''projection lines''. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels.<ref>The conventions illustrated with trees (a) and (b) are preferred by Osborne et al. (2011, 2013).</ref> Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order.<ref>Unordered trees like (d) are associated above all with Tesni\u00e8re's stemmas and with the syntactic strata of Mel\u2019\u010duk's Meaning-Text Theory.</ref> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]].<ref>Three major works on Word Grammar are Hudson (1984, 1990, 2007).</ref> The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words.<ref>Lobin (2003) makes heavy use of these indentations.</ref> Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.\n\nThe point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.\n\n==Types of dependencies==\nThe dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. [[Meaning\u2013text theory]], for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies.<ref>For a discussion of semantic, morphological, and syntactic dependencies in Meaning-Text Theory, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:191ff.) and Osborne 2019: Ch. 5).</ref> A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.\n\n===Semantic dependencies===\nSemantic dependencies are understood in terms of [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s and their [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s.<ref>Concerning semantic dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:192f.).</ref> The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:\n\n::[[File:Semantic dependencies.png|Semantic dependencies]]\n\nThe two arguments ''Sam'' and ''Sally'' in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate ''likes'', whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on ''likes''. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence ''big'' is a predicate in tree (b) that takes ''bones'' as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate ''on'' takes the two arguments ''the picture'' and ''the wall''; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate ''to help'' in (d) takes the one argument ''Jim'' but is not directly connected to ''Jim'' in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.\n\n===Morphological dependencies===\nMorphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words.<ref>Concerning morphological dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:193ff.).</ref> When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.\n\n:[[File:Mophological dependencies 1.png|Morphological dependencies 1]]\n\nThe plural ''houses'' in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence ''these'' appears, not ''this'', which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from ''houses'' to ''these''. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject ''Sam'' demands the appearance of the agreement suffix ''-s'' on the finite verb ''works'', which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from ''Sam'' to ''works''. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective ''alt''. When the indefinite article ''ein'' is used, the strong masculine ending ''-er'' appears on the adjective. When the definite article ''der'' is used, in contrast, the weak ending ''-e'' appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:\n\n::[[File:Morphological dependencies 2'.png|Morphological dependencies 2']]\n\nThe masculine subject ''le chien'' in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective ''blanc'', whereas the feminine subject ''la maison'' demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.\n\nMorphological dependencies play an important role in [[Linguistic typology|typological studies]]. Languages are classified as mostly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] (''Sam work-s'') or mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (''these houses''), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.<ref>The distinction between head- and dependent-marking was established by Nichols (1986). Nichols was using a dependency-based understanding of these distinctions.</ref>\n\n===Prosodic dependencies===\nProsodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of [[clitic]]s.<ref>Concerning prosodic dependencies and the analysis of clitics, see Gro\u00df (2011).</ref> A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. ''-ll'', ''-s'', ''-ve'') and the possessive marker ''-s''. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with the hyphen and the lack of a vertical projection line:\n\n[[File:Prosodic dependencies'.png|Prosodic dependencies']]\n\nThe hyphens and lack of projection lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (''He'll'', ''There's''), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (''He'll'', ''There's'') or on its head (''would've''). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (''Florida's'').\n\n===Syntactic dependencies===\nSyntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic [[constituent (linguistics)|tests for constituents]] being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. [[Etymology|Etymological]] considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution.<ref>Distribution is primary principle used by Owens (1984:36), Schubert (1988:40), and Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:200) for discerning syntactic dependencies.</ref> When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.\n\n==Linear order and discontinuities==\nTraditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions.<ref>Concerning the importance of the two ordering dimensions, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:16ff).</ref> Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re|Tesni\u00e8re]] (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesni\u00e8re, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesni\u00e8re produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesni\u00e8re adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-1.jpg|Two unordered trees]]\n\nThe traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]]. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of [[topicalization]], [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]] are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.\n\nThe nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-2.jpg|8 ordered trees]]\n\nThe a-trees on the left show [[discontinuity (linguistics)|projectivity]] violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its [[head (linguistics)|head]] that is not its [[government (linguistics)|governor]]. The words in red mark the [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]] (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the [[government (linguistics)|governor]] of that constituent.<ref>See Osborne et al. (2012) concerning catenae.</ref> Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, ''wh''-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.\n\n==Syntactic functions==\nTraditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, [[grammatical relation]]s) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.<ref>For discussion and examples of the labels for syntactic functions that are attached to dependency edges and arcs, see for instance Mel'cuk (1988:22, 69) and van Valin (2001:102ff.).</ref>\n\n::[[File:Syntactic functions 1.png|Syntactic functions 1]]\n\nThe syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.\n\nAs a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is much different than in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.\n\nThis question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) are not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they based dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Dependency relation]] (in mathematics)\n*[[Discontinuity (linguistics)|Discontinuity]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Head-directionality parameter]]\n*[[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]\n*[[Verb phrase]]\n*[[Universal Dependencies]]\n*[[Parse tree]]\n*[[Tree (data structure)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=\u00c1gel |editor1-first=Vilmos |editor2-last=Eichinger |editor2-first=Ludwig M. |editor3-last=Eroms |editor3-first=Hans Werner |editor4-last=Hellwig |editor4-first=Peter |editor5-last=Heringer |editor5-first=Hans J\u00fcrgen |editor6-last=Lobin |editor6-first=Henning |title=Dependenz und Valenz:Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Forschung |trans-title=Dependency and Valency:An International Handbook of Contemporary Research |year=2003 |publisher=de Gruyter |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=978-3110141900 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/18595 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}\n*Coseriu, E. 1980.

Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called ''dependencies''. DGs are distinct from [[phrase structure grammar]]s, since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [[Head (linguistics)|head]]) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]] [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]].\n\n==History==\nThe notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries.<ref>Concerning the history of the dependency concept, see Percival (1990).</ref> [[Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be]], a 12th-century [[linguist]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], may have been the first grammarian to use the term ''dependency'' in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of [[term logic]] of antiquity.<ref>Concerning the influence of term logic on the theory of grammar, see Percival (1976).</ref> Dependency is also concretely present in the works of [[S\u00e1muel Brassai]] (1800\u20131897), a Hungarian linguist, [[:de:Franz Kern (Philologe)|Franz Kern]] (1830-1894), a German philologist, and of [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] (1850\u20131936), a Romanian linguist.<ref>Concerning dependency in the works of Brassai, see Imr\u00e9nyi (2013). Concerning dependency in the works of Kern, see Kern's essays (e.g. Kern 1883, 1884). Concerning dependency in the works of Tiktin, see Coseriu (1980).</ref>\n\nModern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Tesni\u00e8re was a Frenchman, a [[polyglot]], and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de syntaxe structurale'' was published posthumously in 1959 \u2013 he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s<ref>Concerning early dependency grammars that may have developed independently of Tesni\u00e8re's work, see for instance Hays (1960), Gaifman (1965), and Robinson (1970).</ref> and a number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works.<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars that were well established by the 1980s are from Hudson (1984), Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et Panevova (1986), Mel\u2019\u010duk (1988), and Starosta (1988).</ref> DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars from the German schools are from Heringer (1996), Engel (1994), Eroms (2000), and \u00c1gel et al. (2003/6) is a massive two volume collection of essays on dependency grammar and valency theory from more than 100 authors.</ref> in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from [[computational linguistics]] and is due, in part, to the influential work that [[David G. Hays|David Hays]] did in machine translation at the [[RAND Corporation]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate [[Treebank|tree banks]]. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ([http://depling.org Depling 2011], [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/depling13/ Depling 2013], [http://depling.org/depling2015/ Depling 2015], [http://www.depling.org/depling2017/call.html Depling 2017], [http://www.depling.org/depling2019/ Depling 2019]).\n\n==Dependency vs. phrase structure==\nDependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there is one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal<ref>The minimality of dependency structures is emphasized, for instance, by Ninio (2006), Hudson 2007: 117, and by Osborne et al. (2011).</ref> compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.\n\n::::[[File:Wearetryingtounderstandthedifference (2).jpg|Dependency vs. phrase structure]]\n\nThese trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an \"ordered\" tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of [[Minimalist program|bare phrase structure]] (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.\n\nThe distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Tesni\u00e8re, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesni\u00e8re's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from [[term logic]] and has no place in linguistics.<ref>Concerning Tesni\u00e8re's rejection of the subject-predicate division of the clause, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:103\u2013105), and for discussion of empirical considerations that support Tesni\u00e8re's point, see Matthews (2007:17ff.), Miller (2011:54ff.), and Osborne et al. (2011:323f.).</ref> The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.\n\n==Dependency grammars==\nThe following frameworks are dependency-based:\n[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|250px|thumb|Hybrid constituency/dependency tree from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]\n\n::* [[Algebraic syntax]]\n::* [[Operator grammar]]\n::* [[Link grammar]]\n::* [[Functional generative description]]\n::* [[Lexicase]]\n::* [[Meaning\u2013text theory]]\n::* [[Word grammar]]\n::* [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~rade/xdg.html Extensible dependency grammar]\n::* [[Universal Dependencies]]\n\n[[Link grammar]] is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes \u2013 see for example the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus|Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank]]. The derivation trees of [[tree-adjoining grammar]] are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.\n\nThere are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.\n\n==Representing dependencies==\nThere are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:\n\n::[[File:Conventions.jpg|Conventions for illustrating dependencies]]\n\nThe representations in (a\u2013d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are ''dependency edges'' and lightly dotted lines are ''projection lines''. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels.<ref>The conventions illustrated with trees (a) and (b) are preferred by Osborne et al. (2011, 2013).</ref> Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order.<ref>Unordered trees like (d) are associated above all with Tesni\u00e8re's stemmas and with the syntactic strata of Mel\u2019\u010duk's Meaning-Text Theory.</ref> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]].<ref>Three major works on Word Grammar are Hudson (1984, 1990, 2007).</ref> The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words.<ref>Lobin (2003) makes heavy use of these indentations.</ref> Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.\n\nThe point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.\n\n==Types of dependencies==\nThe dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. [[Meaning\u2013text theory]], for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies.<ref>For a discussion of semantic, morphological, and syntactic dependencies in Meaning-Text Theory, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:191ff.) and Osborne 2019: Ch. 5).</ref> A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.\n\n===Semantic dependencies===\nSemantic dependencies are understood in terms of [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s and their [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s.<ref>Concerning semantic dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:192f.).</ref> The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:\n\n::[[File:Semantic dependencies.png|Semantic dependencies]]\n\nThe two arguments ''Sam'' and ''Sally'' in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate ''likes'', whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on ''likes''. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence ''big'' is a predicate in tree (b) that takes ''bones'' as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate ''on'' takes the two arguments ''the picture'' and ''the wall''; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate ''to help'' in (d) takes the one argument ''Jim'' but is not directly connected to ''Jim'' in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.\n\n===Morphological dependencies===\nMorphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words.<ref>Concerning morphological dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:193ff.).</ref> When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.\n\n:[[File:Mophological dependencies 1.png|Morphological dependencies 1]]\n\nThe plural ''houses'' in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence ''these'' appears, not ''this'', which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from ''houses'' to ''these''. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject ''Sam'' demands the appearance of the agreement suffix ''-s'' on the finite verb ''works'', which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from ''Sam'' to ''works''. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective ''alt''. When the indefinite article ''ein'' is used, the strong masculine ending ''-er'' appears on the adjective. When the definite article ''der'' is used, in contrast, the weak ending ''-e'' appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:\n\n::[[File:Morphological dependencies 2'.png|Morphological dependencies 2']]\n\nThe masculine subject ''le chien'' in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective ''blanc'', whereas the feminine subject ''la maison'' demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.\n\nMorphological dependencies play an important role in [[Linguistic typology|typological studies]]. Languages are classified as mostly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] (''Sam work-s'') or mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (''these houses''), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.<ref>The distinction between head- and dependent-marking was established by Nichols (1986). Nichols was using a dependency-based understanding of these distinctions.</ref>\n\n===Prosodic dependencies===\nProsodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of [[clitic]]s.<ref>Concerning prosodic dependencies and the analysis of clitics, see Gro\u00df (2011).</ref> A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. ''-ll'', ''-s'', ''-ve'') and the possessive marker ''-s''. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with the hyphen and the lack of a vertical projection line:\n\n[[File:Prosodic dependencies'.png|Prosodic dependencies']]\n\nThe hyphens and lack of projection lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (''He'll'', ''There's''), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (''He'll'', ''There's'') or on its head (''would've''). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (''Florida's'').\n\n===Syntactic dependencies===\nSyntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic [[constituent (linguistics)|tests for constituents]] being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. [[Etymology|Etymological]] considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution.<ref>Distribution is primary principle used by Owens (1984:36), Schubert (1988:40), and Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:200) for discerning syntactic dependencies.</ref> When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.\n\n==Linear order and discontinuities==\nTraditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions.<ref>Concerning the importance of the two ordering dimensions, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:16ff).</ref> Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re|Tesni\u00e8re]] (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesni\u00e8re, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesni\u00e8re produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesni\u00e8re adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-1.jpg|Two unordered trees]]\n\nThe traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]]. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of [[topicalization]], [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]] are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.\n\nThe nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-2.jpg|8 ordered trees]]\n\nThe a-trees on the left show [[discontinuity (linguistics)|projectivity]] violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its [[head (linguistics)|head]] that is not its [[government (linguistics)|governor]]. The words in red mark the [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]] (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the [[government (linguistics)|governor]] of that constituent.<ref>See Osborne et al. (2012) concerning catenae.</ref> Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, ''wh''-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.\n\n==Syntactic functions==\nTraditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, [[grammatical relation]]s) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.<ref>For discussion and examples of the labels for syntactic functions that are attached to dependency edges and arcs, see for instance Mel'cuk (1988:22, 69) and van Valin (2001:102ff.).</ref>\n\n::[[File:Syntactic functions 1.png|Syntactic functions 1]]\n\nThe syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.\n\nAs a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is much different than in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.\n\nThis question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they based dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Dependency relation]] (in mathematics)\n*[[Discontinuity (linguistics)|Discontinuity]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Head-directionality parameter]]\n*[[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]\n*[[Verb phrase]]\n*[[Universal Dependencies]]\n*[[Parse tree]]\n*[[Tree (data structure)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=\u00c1gel |editor1-first=Vilmos |editor2-last=Eichinger |editor2-first=Ludwig M. |editor3-last=Eroms |editor3-first=Hans Werner |editor4-last=Hellwig |editor4-first=Peter |editor5-last=Heringer |editor5-first=Hans J\u00fcrgen |editor6-last=Lobin |editor6-first=Henning |title=Dependenz und Valenz:Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Forschung |trans-title=Dependency and Valency:An International Handbook of Contemporary Research |year=2003 |publisher=de Gruyter |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=978-3110141900 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/18595 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}\n*Coseriu, E. 1980.
