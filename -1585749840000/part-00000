Despite progressing to the next round of the Champions League playing in two major tournaments was beginning to take it's toll on Leeds young but exhausted squad and in the run up to X-mas and the New Year saw Leeds fall worryingly close to the relegation zone but recently brought Rio Ferdinand for 18 million -a world record for a defender, Robbie Kean on loan and key players returning from injury Leeds begun to pick up impressive form in the Premiership and in the Champions League where they progressed to the quarter final, Leeds were ending the season in red hot form but the Champions League dream came to an end in the semi final and United just missed out on 3rd place on the last day of the season. Failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] was viewed as merely a disappointment by fans of the club, given the success in reaching the semi-final. Next season with the squad fully fit, and without the distraction of the Champions League Leeds would be expected to finish in the top 3 with ease.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|2000\u201301 FA

Despite progressing to the next round of the Champions League playing in two major tournaments was beginning to take it's toll on Leeds young but exhausted squad and in the run up to X-mas and the New Year saw Leeds fall worryingly close to the relegation zone but recently brought Rio Ferdinand for 18 million -a world record for a defender and soon after Robbie Kean on loan and key players returning from injury Leeds begun to pick up impressive form in the Premiership and in the Champions League where Leeds progressed to the quarter final, despite ending the season in red hot form the Champions League dream came to an end in the semi final and United just missed out on 3rd place on the last day of the season. Failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] was viewed as merely a disappointment by fans of the club, given the success in reaching the semi-final.

Often, in Asimov's scenarios, Multivac comes to assume formal or informal world power - or even Galactic-wide power. In \"[[The Last Question]]\" (1956) Multivac ends up by effectively becoming [[God]]. Still, in line with Asimov's positive attitude towards Artificial Intelligence, manifested in the \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\", Multivac's rule is in general benevolent and is not resented by humans. Isaac Asimov popularized robotics in a series of short stories written from 1938 to 1942. He famously postulated the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], plot devices to impose order on his fictional robots.<ref name=surgery />\n\n== 1960s ==\n[[File:HAL9000 Case.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|One of HAL 9000's interfaces]]\n\nIn 1964 ''[[Playboy]]'' published [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s influential short story \"Dial F for Frankenstein\", about an increasingly powerful telephone network that takes over the world. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] has cited the story as one of his inspirations for the creation of the World Wide Web. On one day in 1975, all the phones in the world start ringing, a \"cry of pain\" from a newly born intelligence formed by satellite networks linked together, similar to a brain but with telephone switches playing the role of artificial neurons. After the AI flexes its control of military systems, the protagonists resolve to shut down the satellites, but it is too late: the satellites have stopped responding to the humans' ground control directives.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Youngs |first1=Ian |title=11 great authors who wrote for Playboy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41426419 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>Arthur C.

As more jobs were assigned to the computer, more capabilities were added: more memory, processors, neural networks, etc. Eventually, it just \"woke up\" and was given the name Mike (after Mycroft Holmes) by the technician who tended it. Mike sides with prisoners in a successful battle to free the moon. Mike is a sympathetic character, whom the protagonist regards as his best friend; however, his retaining his enormous power after the Moon became independent was bound to cause considerable problems in later time, which Heinlein resolved by killing him off near the end of the Lunar Revolution.
