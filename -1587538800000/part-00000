Created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character made his first appearance in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #109 (February 1978) which was co-plotted by Byrne and his long-time collaborator [[Chris Claremont]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=159}}</ref>\n\nThe character is a founding member and leader of [[Alpha Flight]].

When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet, which he built before coming to the company) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.\n\nHowever, Hudson's girlfriend, [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather MacNeil]], uses political connections in the [[Canadian government]] to persuade Am-Can to waive the charges against him. As a result, [[Department H]] is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Department of National Defence, and Hudson is named as head of operations. Inspired by the debut of the [[Fantastic Four]], James Hudson planned to create a superhero team for Canada.<ref name=\"X-Men #109\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #109</ref> He started out with a prototype superhero team called [[The Flight]] which had [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as one of its members.<ref>''Alpha Flight Special'' vol. 2 #1 (1992)</ref>\n\nFollowing his prototype team the Flight, Hudson forms [[Alpha Flight]] as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exoskeleton into a battle suit. As Weapon Alpha, Hudson sought to capture Wolverine, who had left Canada and joined the [[X-Men]]. He accidentally injured [[Moira MacTaggert]] in the process.<ref name=\"X-Men #109\"/> He then led Alpha Flight in battle against the X-Men to capture Wolverine.<ref>''X-Men'' #120-121</ref> After that mission failed, he made no further attempts to forcibly return Wolverine to Canada.\n\nWith the cancellation of Department H and its funding, Alpha Flight is temporarily disbanded. Hudson laments this for a time, but then is called to action by the arrival of the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]] [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]]. He sets out alone, but Heather takes it upon herself to summon the rest of Alpha Flight, plus two recently \"gold-striped\" members. The team defeats Tundra, and then summarily decides to reform, albeit without direct Government support.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>\n\nHudson and Alpha Flight retain their security clearances and status as RCMP Auxiliaries. They have a series of adventures, both as a team and as individuals. Early on, Hudson expresses a lack of confidence in himself, but he slowly gains some over time. For example, his initial reaction to the imposing creature the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] has him expressing fear. Nevertheless, he confronts the creature \"like a super-hero borne\"<ref>''X-Men'' #140</ref>.\n\nThough Hudson and his wife initially struggle as any Canadian middle-class couple do, he is soon offered a plum job with the large corporation Roxxon in New York City. Relocated to New York, Hudson is almost immediately trapped and set upon by an evil incarnation of [[Omega Flight]] and an old foe: his old boss from Am-Can, [[Jerry Jaxon]]. The battle is soon joined by the rest of Alpha Flight, though it does not end well for Hudson. Although seemingly killed when his battle suit explodes due to the strain of energizing a multiple teleportation matrix system (thanks to Jaxon), he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. There he meets an alien race known as the Q`wrrlln. In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Q`wrrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25</ref> (This is originally posed as a ruse by [[Delphine Courtney]] to confuse and deceive Heather Hudson and the surviving members of Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #26</ref>)\n\nHudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name Vindicator, leaving the title of \"Guardian\" (and position of leadership) with his wife, Heather. Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Q'wrrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against [[Galactus]]. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension. After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhile again working for Department H, Hudson becomes caught up in the plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke. Scientists working for Clarke clone Hudson, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in [[Antarctica]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nA seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Hudson is eventually found by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while the clone becomes leader of [[Beta Flight]]. Later, both Hudsons are captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the clone is killed in the escape.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #143</ref>\n\nAlong with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of [[Plodex]] eggs to their homeworld. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight from a time before Hudson's first \"death\" to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight while the original ones are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nAlpha Flight (Sasquatch, [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck Jr.]], Guardian, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]) is brutally attacked by [[Xorn|The Collective]],<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> resulting in the deaths of Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Puck. Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Guardian suit was worn by [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] during his run in [[Omega Flight]] before joining [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]] as Weapon Omega.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Guardian (alongside Vindicator, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Marrina Smallwood]]) are among the heroes that return from the dead following what happened to the death realms. He reunites Alpha Flight to fight the Great Beasts.<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight''</ref> James Hudson remains among the living after the defeat of the Chaos King.<ref>''Chaos War #5''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFormerly, Guardian used a skin-tight technological \"battle suit\" composed of steel mesh which served as an exoskeleton; it allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and had a personal force field for defense. The suit design stems from a geological/oil-exploration exo-suit designed by Hudson during his early career. The original suit was clunky, over-large and awkward, though it did have an energy beam \"weapon\" system, ostensibly used for drilling/tunneling. The skin-tight suit is considered to be a later, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation, evolution of the original design. The battle suit is cybernetically controlled and contains a high resolution navigation system. The battle suit permits flight by directing beams of force towards the ground, propelling the wearer forward at up to Mach 1.\n\nGuardian could cause the battle suit computers to trigger and release gravitons, canceling the Earth's rotation relative to himself, propelling himself forward at up to about 1000 miles per hour (at the equator). This effect would suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his [[latitude]] positioning.\n\nWhen he returned from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as a separate part of him was incorporated into his body. The alien Q`wrrlln converted James Hudson into a cyborg incorporating much of his battle suit; some of his mechanical parts were visible on the surface of his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced. Hudson's cyborg brain was half-organic (portions of his original brain) and half-mechanical. Hudson could control his mechanical systems by mental command, though he was vulnerable to being controlled by the Q`wrrlln through the mechanical portion of his brain. With great effort the human portion of his brain could override this control.\n\nGuardian's power suit allows for:\n*increased strength and durability;\n*[[cybernetic]] link-up and hacking abilities;\n*advanced weapons systems, including (but not limited to) [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] pulse projectors, beams of concussive energy from the gauntlets, bolts of plasma, [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] beams, and a graviton beam;\n*increased intelligence due to the fusion of his battle suit to his neural network;\n*increased speed, reaching [[Mach number|Mach]] 1;\n*ability to create and travel through a wormhole.\n* the ability to lock himself relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field. Essentially, he cancels out the effects of the Earth's rotation upon himself. This allowed him to apparently \"vanish\", while actually being whisked westward at the speed of the planet's rotation.\n*the creation of a protective force field that dampens inertia and absorbs energy;\n*force shields that also deflect outside pressure, such as in the ocean depths;\n\nHudson has earned a Ph.D. in engineering. He is a brilliant engineer, inventor, and a good battle strategist and leader.\n\n==Other versions==\n*On [[Marvel Zombies (series)|Earth-2149]], a zombified Guardian can be seen attacking the X-Men alongside zombified versions of Alpha Flight. He is killed when [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] scalps him with a metal blade. His body can later be seen being examined by [[Reed Richards]] on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]].\n*On Earth-3240, where the Cold War never ended, Guardian was Heather Hudson's second husband. (Her previous husband was [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], whom she had killed while under the control of Weapon X.) This Guardian has much the same powers as the [[Earth-616]] Guardian.\n* On [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth 1610]], the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Hudson is a non-powered Gulf war veteran and sheriff of Port St. Lucie, Florida, and was acquainted with [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], who also introduced him to his wife Heather. Wolverine entrusted him with raising his son from Magda a.k.a. \"The Witch of [[Wundagore]]\". Hudson named him ''James Hudson'' (which later became James Howlett, after James discovered his true father). James eventually manifested a healing factor and claws in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X]]''.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Hudson appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series under the code name Vindicator, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]]. He conspired with the head of Alpha Flight to force Wolverine's return to Canada so they can conduct experiments on how he was able to survive the [[adamantium]] bonding process and, if possible, extract the adamantium from his skeleton, regardless of the possibility of killing Wolverine. He felt heavily betrayed by Wolverine leaving Alpha Flight and used that as justification for his actions. He also deceived his team into believing he was bringing Wolverine back to the team. Throughout his battle with Logan, he was able to use his force field to protect himself from Wolverine's claws. However, when it failed, he was at Logan's mercy. Wolverine told him that the only reason he was still breathing after the battle is that he loved Vindicator's wife Heather. He also threatened that, if he or Alpha Flight came after him again, all bets were off.\n\n===Video games===\n* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. He and Vindicator are encountered in an abandoned Weapon X facility. He has special dialogue with Wolverine.\n* Guardian appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n*In 2008, Hasbro released an action figure of Guardian in its Marvel Legends line which was exclusive to Walmart.\n*In 2019, Hasbro released another Marvel Legends figure which came with a Build-A-Figure piece of another Canadian character, [[Wendigo (comics)|the Wendigo]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://alphaflight.net/showwiki/Guardian_I AlphaFlight.Net Alphanex Entry on - Guardian]\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Guardian_%28James_Hudson%29 Guardian] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guardian Guardian (Marvel Comics)}}\n[[Category:Canadian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Canadian-themed superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Ontario]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Powered exoskeletons in fiction]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=[[File:Alpha flight 89 guardian.jpg|250px|]]\n|caption=Guardian in a cover detail to<br>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #89.<br>Art by [[Jim Lee]].\n|character_name=Guardian\n|real_name=James MacDonald Hudson\n|species=Human Cyborg\n|homeworld=[[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] ([[Earth-616]])\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=[[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #109 (February, 1978)\n|creators=[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]\n|alliances=[[Alpha Flight]]<br>[[Beta Flight]]<br>[[Department H]]<br>[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]\n|aliases=Weapon Alpha, Vindicator, Jamie, Jimmy, Mac, Jimmy Hudson, Dr. Hudson, Antiguard, Major Maple-Leaf\n|powers=\n*Physical attributes enhanced to peak of human potential\n*Flight\n*Personal force field\n*Ability to fire energy blasts\n|cat=super\n|subcat=Marvel Comics\n|hero=y\n|sortkey=Guardian\n}}\n'''Guardian''' ('''James Hudson'''), also known as '''Weapon Alpha''' and '''Vindicator''', is a [[fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

This Guardian has much the same powers as the [[Earth-616]] Guardian.\n* On [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth 1610]], the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Hudson is a non-powered Gulf war veteran and sheriff of Port St. Lucie, Florida, and was acquainted with [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], who also introduced him to his wife Heather. Wolverine entrusted him with raising his son from Magda a.k.a. \"The Witch of [[Wundagore]]\". Hudson named him ''James Hudson'' (which later became James Howlett, after James discovered his true father). James eventually manifested a healing factor and claws in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X]]''.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Hudson appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series under the code name Vindicator, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]]. He conspired with the head of Alpha Flight to force Wolverine's return to Canada so they can conduct experiments on how he was able to survive the [[adamantium]] bonding process and, if possible, extract the adamantium from his skeleton, regardless of the possibility of killing Wolverine. He felt heavily betrayed by Wolverine leaving Alpha Flight and used that as justification for his actions. He also deceived his team into believing he was bringing Wolverine back to the team. Throughout his battle with Logan, he was able to use his force field to protect himself from Wolverine's claws. However, when it failed, he was at Logan's mercy. Wolverine told him that the only reason he was still breathing after the battle is that he loved Vindicator's wife Heather. He also threatened that, if he or Alpha Flight came after him again, all bets were off.\n\n===Video games===\n* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. He and Vindicator are encountered in an abandoned Weapon X facility. He has special dialogue with Wolverine.\n* Guardian appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n*In 2008, Hasbro released an action figure of Guardian in its Marvel Legends line which was exclusive to Walmart.\n*In 2019, Hasbro released another Marvel Legends figure which came with a Build-A-Figure piece of another Canadian character, [[Wendigo (comics)|the Wendigo]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://alphaflight.net/showwiki/Guardian_I AlphaFlight.Net Alphanex Entry on - Guardian]\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Guardian_%28James_Hudson%29 Guardian] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guardian Guardian (Marvel Comics)}}\n[[Category:Canadian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Canadian-themed superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Ontario]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Powered exoskeletons in fiction]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]\n", "name_user": "TCB297", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_(Marvel_Comics)"}

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \\Lambda_{ij}, U_0,  t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD)<ref>Vysotsky, M.

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus<ref>A.

This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in [[statistical thermodynamics]] has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy ''E'' over ''N'' identical systems.\n[[Carath\u00e9odory]] linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn 1865, Clausius named the concept of {{mvar|S}}, \"the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system,\" ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) after the Greek word for 'transformation'.<ref name=Gil399>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |authorlink1=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill |url-access=registration |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |p=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill/page/399 399]}}</ref>  He gives \"transformational content\" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" ({{lang|de|W\u00e4rme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of the word ''energy'', as he found the concepts nearly \"analogous in their physical significance.\"<ref name=Gil399/> This term was formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} ('work') by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae]]}} ('transformation').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene f\u00fcr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant.

For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \\Lambda_{ij}, U_0,  t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S.

The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD)<ref>Vysotsky, M.

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

Military brats move an average of 10 times while growing up; some have moved as many as 36 times,<ref name=\"bojh\"/> often thousands of miles in distance, including spending years overseas.<ref name=\"bojh\"/>'' '']]\n\nStudies show that this group is shaped by several forces. A major influence is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being hundreds or thousands of miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture of resilience and adaptivity, constant loss of friendship ties, a facility or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or to a wide range of regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in [[war]], stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline).<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /><ref name=\"morton\" /><ref name=\"interview\">Britten, Samuel L.

Studies show that growing up immersed in military culture can have long-lasting effects on children, both in positive and also some negative ways.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" />\n\n===Life on base===\n[[Image:Amarillo Air Force Base - Front Gate - Postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Base gate and checkpoint at the since-closed [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo AFB]]. Life inside of military bases differs significantly from the civilian world, giving many military brats a feeling of difference from civilian culture.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>]]\n\nMilitary bases are often small cities with 10,000 or more people, and are self-contained worlds where military culture is primary and [[civilian]] culture is secondary.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\">Wertsch (1991)</ref> Military families do not always live on base, but often do.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Military towns, the areas immediately surrounding a base, are also often highly influenced by military culture.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> While the general public uses the term \"base\" to refer any military installation, within the US military the term \"base\" primarily applies to Air Force or Navy installations while Army installations are called \"posts.\"\n\nMilitary brats grow up moving from base to base as they follow their parent or parents to new assignments.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Sometimes living on base, sometimes off, the base in both cases is often the center of military brat life, where shopping, recreation, schools and the military community form a string of temporary towns for military brats as they grow up.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\n[[Image:US Navy 020813-N-3235P-520 shopping at the commissary.jpg|left|thumb|Two military brats shopping at the [[Defense Commissary Agency|commissary]], located in the military base. Bases are often self-contained towns, with shopping, schools, hospitals, recreation centers, movie theaters, etc.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>]]\n\nStudies show that the culture on military bases is perceived by most current and former military brats as significantly different from civilian culture.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> It is widely experienced as being pervaded by military cultural norms and expectations, as well as the presence of military police or their other military security forces equivalents, armed guards, high security zones and some degree of surveillance. Some bases also contain unique features, such as air bases with numerous aircraft and attendant noise, or seaports with large numbers of naval vessels. Balancing this are extensive areas which are more relaxed in character, for on-base housing, shopping, dining, recreation, sports and entertainment, as well as base chapels which host diverse religious services.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> However, military regulations, laws and social codes of conduct are in force throughout the base, which can be very different from local, state or national laws, regulations and customs.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\nMilitary language also has differences from standard American English and is often peppered with [[military slang]] and [[List of U.S. government and military acronyms|military acronyms]].<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> There are many words and phrases that are unique to the military world and which make up a part of everyday conversation on bases.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> For example, time is measured in 24-hour rather than 12-hour segments as in the civilian world, and distances, primarily on stateside Army bases or on many U.S. bases of all services overseas, often described in meters and kilometers (or \"Clicks\" in military slang) instead of yards or miles.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Consequently, many military brats report feelings of cultural identity that have a military flavor and a feeling of difference from local civilian culture, even on bases in the United States.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> These feelings of difference can also be made more complex by virtue of having absorbed varying degrees of overseas cultures and also different regional American cultures while living in different places as a part of the military brat lifestyle.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\nBases do form communities, but due to most of them experiencing frequent 100% turnover in just a few years, an adult military brat can never return and find old friends, neighbors or even former teachers, on bases where they grew up. Base schools usually have an even higher turnover rate, reaching 100% turnover in as little as two years.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Due to revocation of base privileges upon reaching the age of 18 (or 23 if one attends college), access to bases to reminisce or reconnect with one's places of growing up can also be difficult.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\n===Size of population===\nAlthough no exact figures are available, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] estimates that approximately 15 million Americans are former or current military brats, including those who spent all or part of their childhood and/or adolescence in the lifestyle.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> This population includes an age range from less than 1 years old to over 90 years of age, since there have been military brats for generations.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> Many military brats spent all of their growing up years in the active lifestyle, some for only part, although military family issues, dynamics and influences may continue nevertheless. Also, not all military brats grow up moving all the time, although many do.\n\n==Studies==\nMilitary brats have been studied extensively, both from the perspective of [[social psychology]] and as a distinct and unique American subculture, although less so in terms of long-term impact of the lifestyle. There are also some gaps in studies of more recent (post-[[Cold War]]-era) military brats. Collectively these studies paint a fairly consistent picture of how the lifestyle tends to influence the population (on average) in various aspects of life. These studies look at overall patterns and individual experiences may vary widely:\n\n===Positive patterns in overall study results===\nSome strong positives that have been identified in studies of military brat populations are a high occurrence of very resilient personalities, exceptional social skills, a high level of multicultural or international awareness, proficiency in foreign languages, and a statistically very strong affinity for careers that entail service to others.<ref name=\"morton\" /><ref name=\"Wertsch-p385, 386\">{{cite book\n | last = Wertsch\n | first = Mary Edwards\n | authorlink = Mary Edwards Wertsch\n | title = Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress\n | edition = 1st hardcover\n | date = April 23, 1991\n | publisher = Harmony\n | isbn = 978-0-517-58400-2\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/militarybratsleg00wert/page/385 385\u2013386]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/militarybratsleg00wert/page/385\n }}</ref> Studies show that ex-military kids end up pursuing service-related careers in very high numbers: military service, teaching, counseling, police, nursing and foreign service work being highly represented in military brat career statistics (in comparison to statistics on non-military brat patterns of employment choices).<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /><ref name=\"morton\" /> [[Mary Edwards Wertsch]] also identified a pattern (for those military brats who do not choose military service) of work that is more independent (self-employment / avoidance of direct subservience to authority figures) and along those lines also favoring creative and artistic professions that offer more independence.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/> She also reported that for those military brats who did choose military service there was a tendency to go through a phase of bucking or testing authority during military service, or a pattern of resenting authority, represented in her study population.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/> However, military brats who become soldiers also tend to do well overall in the profession.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/>\n\nAs adults, military brats can share many of the same positive and negative traits identified in other populations that experienced very mobile childhoods. Having had the opportunity to live around the world, military brats can have a breadth of experiences unmatched by most teenagers.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> Regardless of race, religion, nationality, or gender, brats might identify more with other highly mobile children than with non-mobile ones.<ref>Williams, Rudi (2001) and also Williams (2002) p 79.</ref> Military brats also graduate from college at a higher rate than the civilian population and divorce at a lower rate.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" />\n\n===Negative patterns in overall study results===\n\nOn the negative side, studies show that some former military brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places,<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /> as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /> In some cases there is also the loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed).

The comfort, or sense of restriction, (or both) that can be found on military bases is not limited to the physical trappings, but can be fortified via some of the consistent [[ritual]]s common to them. When moving around the world, these rituals can help brats feel at home in their new community. Even though the faces and geography change, the \"base\" can remain recognizable because the rituals are often uniform. The underlying principle of these rituals is consistent: to promote patriotism.<ref name=\"incengine1\"/>\n\nIt has been claimed by Samuel Britten on the basis of anecdotal evidence that life on military bases is associated with comparatively greater patriotic sentiments.<ref>Britten, Samuel (November 30, 1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20061119025737/http://www.tckworld.com/comparisons.html \"TCK World: A Comparison of Different \"Versions\" Of TCKs\"] Third Culture Kid World.

Family members know that their actions and behavior can have a direct impact on the military service member's career.<ref name = \"career\">Wertsch (1991), p. 30. Truscott (1989), p. 107. \"Military brats were aware that their behavior or misbehavior was a direct reflection on their parents, and specifically on their fathers\".</ref> The consequences of misbehavior for a military brat are generally greater than for civilian children. A military person's career and [[social identity]] can be dashed in seconds by a willful or careless child.<ref name=\"Wertsch3132\">Wertsch (1991), pp. 31\u201332</ref> For example, when a military brat gets in trouble, the authorities may call the parent's [[Commanding Officer]] or the [[base commander|Base Commander]] before, or instead of, calling the brat's parents.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p 31. Wertsch records numerous examples of this occurring in her book. Two of the more egregious examples: A \"teenage boy committed the unpardonable sin of teeing off on the golf course at 5:00 p.m., while [[Sunset (bugle call)|Retreat]] was being blown, instead of standing respectfully at attention as the base's flag was lowered for the day. An officer reported him, and his father got a call from high up in the base hierarchy. The incident went down on the father's permanent record. The same thing happens to another father whose twelve-year-old son knocked over a trash can in front of the base teen club. The son was picked up by the military police, who called not the father, but the father's commanding officer.\" Wertsch also describes a child who was misbehaving at the Base Exchange. An adult the child did not know recognized him and contacted the child's parents.</ref> If the commanding officer or base commander is contacted, the brat's behavior may become a part of the military member's [[service record|record]], and adversely affect his or her ability to be promoted or the duty assignments (particularly overseas) that lead to advancement.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p. 28. Prior to 1987, Commanding Officers were required to comment on an army officer's spouse on the officer's annual evaluation. Even though the spaces for spousal review were removed in 1987, \"there is widespread feeling that a spouse's conduct is still taken into consideration and may influence a service member's career.\" Spouses were evaluated on how well behaved their children were and how clean they maintained their houses.</ref>\n\nResearch into military brats has consistently shown them to be better behaved than their civilian counterparts.<ref name=\"Watanabe106\" /> Sociologist Phoebe Price posed three possible hypotheses as to why brats are better behaved: firstly, military parents have a lower threshold for misbehavior in their children; secondly, the [[Social mobility|mobility]] of [[teenagers]] might make them less likely to attract attention to themselves, as many want to fit in and are less secure with their surroundings; and thirdly, normative constraints are greater, with brats knowing that their behavior is under scrutiny and can affect the military member's career.<ref>Price (2002) p 44\u201345. Price also noted previous studies that showed that military brats had \"a lower level of some childhood disorders such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD.)\"</ref>\n\nTeenage years are typically a period when people establish independence by taking some risks away from their parents. When the teenager lives in a \"fish-bowl community,\" a small self-contained community such as a base, challenging boundaries may be more difficult. Brats know that misbehavior or rebellious activity will be reported to their parents.<ref name = \"eakin 25\">Eakin (1998) p 25</ref> Brats are sometimes under constant pressure to conform to what military culture expects; this means they are sometimes seen as being more mature in their youth than their peers. If they grow up overseas or on military bases, they might have limited opportunities to see a wide range of role models in different professions.<ref name=\"Eakin1\">Eakin (1998) p 20</ref>\n\nStrict discipline can have the opposite effect: brats may rebel or behave in adolescent manners well beyond what is normally considered acceptable.<ref name=\"Cottrell1993\">Cottrell, Ann and Ruth Hill Useem (1993).

And the exercise of that most certainly extends to spouses.\"</ref> the facilities provided for officers and enlisted personnel differ dramatically. The officers' housing will generally be more accessible to base activities, larger in size, and better [[landscape architecture|landscaped]]. On larger bases, the officers' housing may be broken down into different categories, with senior officers receiving larger and more opulent housing; sometimes, the highest-ranking officers live in a row of large houses often referred to as \"Colonels'/Captains' Row\" or \"Generals'/Admirals' Row,\" as the case may be.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Officer Clubs are more elegant than the Enlisted Clubs. Officers have cleaner, more elaborate recreational facilities than their enlisted counterparts. Historically, base [[chapel]]s and movie theaters would have designated seating for officers and their families. For a part of the 20th century, some bases had two [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and two [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]] troops\u2014one for officer children and one for enlisted children.<ref name=\"Wertsch 290\">Wertsch (1991), p. 290.</ref>\n\nThese differences are not merely external, but a core aspect of military life.<ref name=\"Wertsch 290\" /> Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers are afraid to upset the officers.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p 297. One interviewee said \"You could always tell the son of the [Commanding Officer]. He was the [[American football|football]] star, he had good grades.\"</ref> The physical separation and differences between available activities make it very difficult.<ref>Truscott (1989) p 168. \"Privileges accorded by rank were highly visible ... And all military brats, no matter where their father had fit in the hierarchy of rank, emphasized, over and over, that rank was pervasive and clearly defined.\"</ref> Most military brats on a personal level do not let this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's pay grade or rank.\n\nThe separation by rank has the intended purpose of maintaining military discipline among service members. According to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, it can be illegal for an officer to [[fraternize]] with an enlisted person because it would erode the military hierarchy. This is often conveyed to the children of military personnel. Two brats whose parents have a subordinate-supervisory relationship can cause problems for both their parents.<ref>Wertsch (1991), pp. 285\u2013288.</ref>\n\nTo a lesser degree, military classism also includes the branch of service to which the military parent belongs. If asked to name \"the best branch of service,\" military brats will almost invariably name the one to which their parent belonged. They will be able to articulate many reasons why \"their\" branch of the service is the best. These biases are maintained well past the time they cease to be [[military dependent]]s. When brats grow up, these boundaries are replaced by a shared identity based upon that of being a military brat.<ref>Wertsch (1991), pp. 314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nWhile a class hierarchy is reflected in stratified housing structures, military classism differs from traditional class structures in some significant ways \u2013 namely, schooling and access to quality healthcare. Children of military personnel attend the same base schools regardless of rank, creating peer cultures that are usually not class-based, and providing equal access to educational resources. Similarly, all military personnel receive the same quality of healthcare by the same providers.\n\n===Anti-racism===\nIn 1948, nearly 20 years before the [[civil rights movement]] swept through the non-military segments of U.S. society, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. It outlawed segregation in the military and made it illegal, per military law, to make a [[racism|racist]] remark.<ref name=\"bojh\"/> Fifteen years later, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] issued Department of Defense [[Directive 5120.36]]. \"Every military commander,\" the Directive mandates, \"has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off-duty hours.\"<ref>Department of Defense Directive 5120.36</ref> The directive was issued in 1963, but it was not until 1967 that the first non-military installation was declared off-limits to military personnel due to its discriminatory practices.<ref>Antecol, Heather and Deborah Cobb-Clark, [http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/spring06/ped/HeatherAntecol5-1-2006.pdf Racial and Ethnic Harassment in Local Communities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830080558/http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/spring06/ped/HeatherAntecol5-1-2006.pdf |date=2006-08-30 }} Oct 4, 2005. p 8.

The bonds of the military community are normally seen by military dependents as being stronger bonds than the differences of race.

These are echoed in other literature of the Cold War, such as [[Pat Conroy]]'s ''[[The Great Santini (novel)|The Great Santini]]''. In the 1980s and 1990s the U.S. military focused on the issues of abuse and alcoholism. The impact on the military's efforts remains inconclusive. Some studies report higher rates of abuse in military families, while others report lower rates.<ref name = \"rentz\" />\n\nThe studies that conclude abuse is a bigger problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse because of the potential impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members are more likely to be ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.<ref name = \"rentz\">{{cite journal | pmid =  16534146 | doi=10.1177/1524838005285916 | volume=7 | title=Family violence in the military: a review of the literature | date=April 2006 | journal=Trauma Violence Abuse | pages=93\u2013108  | last1 = Rentz | first1 = ED | last2 = Martin | first2 = SL | last3 = Gibbs | first3 = DA | last4 = Clinton-Sherrod | first4 = M | last5 = Hardison | first5 = J | last6 = Marshall | first6 = SW}} p 94\u201395</ref>\n\n==Current military brats==\nIn 2010, the U.S. Defense Department reported that there were currently 2 million American children and teenagers who have had at least one parent deployed in a war zone in the then-current [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] conflicts.<ref name=\"wilson\">Wilson, Elaine, \"Military Teens Cope With Wartime Challenges\", American Forces Press Service, Department of Defense, FORT CAMPBELL, Ky., April 22, 2010 http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0410_military child/military-teens.html</ref> Over 900,000 have had a parent deployed multiple times.<ref name=\"wilson\" />\n\nMost of the research into military brats has been conducted on the long-term effects on adults who grew up during the Cold War and also during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Korean War|Korean]] wars. As the Cold War came to an end, the role of the United States Armed Forces changed. The U.S. military realized that there was distinct correlation between the quality of life and retention and operational effectiveness. To this end, the military started to change the living standards that most Cold War brats grew up with. The demographics of the military changed. The modern military has a larger proportion of married military members. Since base housing is designed for fewer families, more families are forced to live off-base.\n\nMilitary personnel are now being supplemented by more civilians filling essential roles, and the introduction of large megabases that intermesh different service branches and their individual cultures has also affected the demographics.<ref name=\"McClure473\">McClure, Peggy and Walter Broughton (2000) \"Measuring the Cohesion of Military Communities.\" ''Armed Forces & Society,'' Vol 26 No 3, Spring 2000. p. 473</ref> Finally, during the post-Cold War period, the United States has been involved in three extended military engagements (two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan).

With the advent of the [[Internet]] it is possible for family members to communicate with servicemen in combat zones. This allows brats to remain in closer contact with their military parent(s), but it also increases tension as more details reach the military families. Round-the-clock news agencies, such as [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]], spread news faster than the military bureaucracy can process the details. This means that military families know that servicemen have died before official word reaches the family. Military psychiatrist Colonel Stephen Cozza says that a \"sense of fear\" accompanies news of the death of a service member until confirmation that the service member was not a loved one.<ref name=\"Cozza 377\">{{cite journal | pmid =  16217632 | doi=10.1007/s11126-005-4973-y | volume=76 | title=Military families and children during operation Iraqi freedom | year=2005 | journal=Psychiatr Q | pages=371\u20138  | last1 = Cozza | first1 = SJ | last2 = Chun | first2 = RS | last3 = Polo | first3 = JA}} p 377</ref>\n\nWertsch has pointed out, however, that during the Vietnam War, televised news war coverage was also very intense and constant, and that similar issues of military family fear being intensified by television coverage were also present for military brats and spouses of that era with a family member in the war.<ref name=Wertsch/>\n\nDespite these facts, studies show only a slight increase in immediate stressors among military brats whose parents serve in a combat zone, although no studies on the longer-term effects have ever been done. Boys and younger children do show the most risk when a parent is deployed, but rarely does this require clinical intervention. However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid =  16217632 | doi=10.1007/s11126-005-4973-y | volume=76 | title=Military families and children during operation Iraqi freedom | year=2005 | journal=Psychiatr Q | pages=371\u20138  | last1 = Cozza | first1 = SJ | last2 = Chun | first2 = RS | last3 = Polo | first3 = JA}} p 373.

Military brats can feel a \"sense of euphoria\" when they discover that other brats share the same feelings and emotions. According to the study, brats share a bond with one another through common experiences that transcends race, religion, and nationality.<ref name=\"The Military Brats Seal\"/> Another common theme behind their joining brat organizations is to stay connected or reconnect with their old friends.\nWith all the focus on veterans, the children are left to grow up in sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help.

Military brats move an average of 10 times while growing up; some have moved as many as 36 times,<ref name=\"bojh\"/> often thousands of miles in distance, including spending years overseas.<ref name=\"bojh\"/>'' '']]\n\nStudies show that this group is shaped by several forces. A major influence is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being hundreds or thousands of miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture of resilience and adaptivity, constant loss of friendship ties, a facility or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or to a wide range of regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in [[war]], stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline).<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /><ref name=\"morton\" /><ref name=\"interview\">Britten, Samuel L.

Studies show that growing up immersed in military culture can have long-lasting effects on children, both in positive and also some negative ways.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" />\n\n===Life on base===\n[[Image:Amarillo Air Force Base - Front Gate - Postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Base gate and checkpoint at the since-closed [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo AFB]]. Life inside of military bases differs significantly from the civilian world, giving many military brats a feeling of difference from civilian culture.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>]]\n\nMilitary bases are often small cities with 10,000 or more people, and are self-contained worlds where military culture is primary and [[civilian]] culture is secondary.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\">Wertsch (1991)</ref> Military families do not always live on base, but often do.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Military towns, the areas immediately surrounding a base, are also often highly influenced by military culture.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> While the general public uses the term \"base\" to refer any military installation, within the US military the term \"base\" primarily applies to Air Force or Navy installations while Army installations are called \"posts.\"\n\nMilitary brats grow up moving from base to base as they follow their parent or parents to new assignments.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Sometimes living on base, sometimes off, the base in both cases is often the center of military brat life, where shopping, recreation, schools and the military community form a string of temporary towns for military brats as they grow up.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\n[[Image:US Navy 020813-N-3235P-520 shopping at the commissary.jpg|left|thumb|Two military brats shopping at the [[Defense Commissary Agency|commissary]], located in the military base. Bases are often self-contained towns, with shopping, schools, hospitals, recreation centers, movie theaters, etc.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>]]\n\nStudies show that the culture on military bases is perceived by most current and former military brats as significantly different from civilian culture.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> It is widely experienced as being pervaded by military cultural norms and expectations, as well as the presence of military police or their other military security forces equivalents, armed guards, high security zones and some degree of surveillance. Some bases also contain unique features, such as air bases with numerous aircraft and attendant noise, or seaports with large numbers of naval vessels. Balancing this are extensive areas which are more relaxed in character, for on-base housing, shopping, dining, recreation, sports and entertainment, as well as base chapels which host diverse religious services.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> However, military regulations, laws and social codes of conduct are in force throughout the base, which can be very different from local, state or national laws, regulations and customs.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\nMilitary language also has differences from standard American English and is often peppered with [[military slang]] and [[List of U.S. government and military acronyms|military acronyms]].<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> There are many words and phrases that are unique to the military world and which make up a part of everyday conversation on bases.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> For example, time is measured in 24-hour rather than 12-hour segments as in the civilian world, and distances, primarily on stateside Army bases or on many U.S. bases of all services overseas, often described in meters and kilometers (or \"Clicks\" in military slang) instead of yards or miles.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Consequently, many military brats report feelings of cultural identity that have a military flavor and a feeling of difference from local civilian culture, even on bases in the United States.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> These feelings of difference can also be made more complex by virtue of having absorbed varying degrees of overseas cultures and also different regional American cultures while living in different places as a part of the military brat lifestyle.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\nBases do form communities, but due to most of them experiencing frequent 100% turnover in just a few years, an adult military brat can never return and find old friends, neighbors or even former teachers, on bases where they grew up. Base schools usually have an even higher turnover rate, reaching 100% turnover in as little as two years.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/> Due to revocation of base privileges upon reaching the age of 18 (or 23 if one attends college), access to bases to reminisce or reconnect with one's places of growing up can also be difficult.<ref name=\"Wertsch 1991\"/>\n\n===Size of population===\nAlthough no exact figures are available, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] estimates that approximately 15 million Americans are former or current military brats, including those who spent all or part of their childhood and/or adolescence in the lifestyle.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> This population includes an age range from less than 1 years old to over 90 years of age, since there have been military brats for generations.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> Many military brats spent all of their growing up years in the active lifestyle, some for only part, although military family issues, dynamics and influences may continue nevertheless. Also, not all military brats grow up moving all the time, although many do.\n\n==Studies==\nMilitary brats have been studied extensively, both from the perspective of [[social psychology]] and as a distinct and unique American subculture, although less so in terms of long-term impact of the lifestyle. There are also some gaps in studies of more recent (post-[[Cold War]]-era) military brats. Collectively these studies paint a fairly consistent picture of how the lifestyle tends to influence the population (on average) in various aspects of life. These studies look at overall patterns and individual experiences may vary widely:\n\n===Positive patterns in overall study results===\nSome strong positives that have been identified in studies of military brat populations are a high occurrence of very resilient personalities, exceptional social skills, a high level of multicultural or international awareness, proficiency in foreign languages, and a statistically very strong affinity for careers that entail service to others.<ref name=\"morton\" /><ref name=\"Wertsch-p385, 386\">{{cite book\n | last = Wertsch\n | first = Mary Edwards\n | authorlink = Mary Edwards Wertsch\n | title = Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress\n | edition = 1st hardcover\n | date = April 23, 1991\n | publisher = Harmony\n | isbn = 978-0-517-58400-2\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/militarybratsleg00wert/page/385 385\u2013386]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/militarybratsleg00wert/page/385\n }}</ref> Studies show that ex-military kids end up pursuing service-related careers in very high numbers: military service, teaching, counseling, police, nursing and foreign service work being highly represented in military brat career statistics (in comparison to statistics on non-military brat patterns of employment choices).<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /><ref name=\"morton\" /> [[Mary Edwards Wertsch]] also identified a pattern (for those military brats who do not choose military service) of work that is more independent (self-employment / avoidance of direct subservience to authority figures) and along those lines also favoring creative and artistic professions that offer more independence.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/> She also reported that for those military brats who did choose military service there was a tendency to go through a phase of bucking or testing authority during military service, or a pattern of resenting authority, represented in her study population.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/> However, military brats who become soldiers also tend to do well overall in the profession.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/>\n\nAs adults, military brats can share many of the same positive and negative traits identified in other populations that experienced very mobile childhoods. Having had the opportunity to live around the world, military brats can have a breadth of experiences unmatched by most teenagers.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> Regardless of race, religion, nationality, or gender, brats might identify more with other highly mobile children than with non-mobile ones.<ref>Williams, Rudi (2001) and also Williams (2002) p 79.</ref> Military brats also graduate from college at a higher rate than the civilian population and divorce at a lower rate.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" />\n\n===Negative patterns in overall study results===\n\nOn the negative side, studies show that some former military brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places,<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /> as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents.<ref name=\"Wertsch-p350\"/><ref name=\"bojh\" /> In some cases there is also the loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability.<ref name=\"bojh\" /> A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[avoidant personality disorder]], [[separation anxiety disorder]], etc.<ref name=Wertsch>Wertsch, Mary Edwards (April 23, 1991).

The comfort, or sense of restriction, (or both) that can be found on military bases is not limited to the physical trappings, but can be fortified via some of the consistent [[ritual]]s common to them. When moving around the world, these rituals can help brats feel at home in their new community. Even though the faces and geography change, the \"base\" can remain recognizable because the rituals are often uniform. The underlying principle of these rituals is consistent: to promote patriotism.<ref name=\"incengine1\"/>\n\nIt has been claimed by Samuel Britten on the basis of anecdotal evidence that life on military bases is associated with comparatively greater patriotic sentiments.<ref>Britten, Samuel (November 30, 1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20061119025737/http://www.tckworld.com/comparisons.html \"TCK World: A Comparison of Different \"Versions\" Of TCKs\"] Third Culture Kid World.

Family discipline was a personal matter, to be handled behind the closed doors of the neat rows of houses on military posts, but the implication that fathers who fit into the orderly world of the military should be able to control small children was clear.\"</ref> They described their military parent as rigid in discipline, inflexible, intolerant of dissent, disapproving of non-conforming behavior, insensitive to their emotions, and not accepting of personal privacy.<ref>Wertsch (1991), pp. 10\u201323</ref> A Cold War era military [[psychologist]], publishing in the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'', reviewed the parents of patients who came to his clinic, and concluded that 93% of patients came from military families that were overly authoritarian.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p. 24.</ref>\n\nDisciplinary expectations extend beyond the military family. Family members know that their actions and behavior can have a direct impact on the military service member's career.<ref name = \"career\">Wertsch (1991), p. 30. Truscott (1989), p. 107. \"Military brats were aware that their behavior or misbehavior was a direct reflection on their parents, and specifically on their fathers\".</ref> The consequences of misbehavior for a military brat are generally greater than for civilian children. A military person's career and [[social identity]] can be dashed in seconds by a willful or careless child.<ref name=\"Wertsch3132\">Wertsch (1991), pp. 31\u201332</ref> For example, when a military brat gets in trouble, the authorities may call the parent's [[Commanding Officer]] or the [[base commander|Base Commander]] before, or instead of, calling the brat's parents.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p 31. Wertsch records numerous examples of this occurring in her book. Two of the more egregious examples: A \"teenage boy committed the unpardonable sin of teeing off on the golf course at 5:00 p.m., while [[Sunset (bugle call)|Retreat]] was being blown, instead of standing respectfully at attention as the base's flag was lowered for the day. An officer reported him, and his father got a call from high up in the base hierarchy. The incident went down on the father's permanent record. The same thing happens to another father whose twelve-year-old son knocked over a trash can in front of the base teen club. The son was picked up by the military police, who called not the father, but the father's commanding officer.\" Wertsch also describes a child who was misbehaving at the Base Exchange. An adult the child did not know recognized him and contacted the child's parents.</ref> If the commanding officer or base commander is contacted, the brat's behavior may become a part of the military member's [[service record|record]], and adversely affect his or her ability to be promoted or the duty assignments (particularly overseas) that lead to advancement.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p. 28. Prior to 1987, Commanding Officers were required to comment on an army officer's spouse on the officer's annual evaluation. Even though the spaces for spousal review were removed in 1987, \"there is widespread feeling that a spouse's conduct is still taken into consideration and may influence a service member's career.\" Spouses were evaluated on how well behaved their children were and how clean they maintained their houses.</ref>\n\nResearch into military brats has consistently shown them to be better behaved than their civilian counterparts.<ref name=\"Watanabe106\" /> Sociologist Phoebe Price posed three possible hypotheses as to why brats are better behaved: firstly, military parents have a lower threshold for misbehavior in their children; secondly, the [[Social mobility|mobility]] of [[teenagers]] might make them less likely to attract attention to themselves, as many want to fit in and are less secure with their surroundings; and thirdly, normative constraints are greater, with brats knowing that their behavior is under scrutiny and can affect the military member's career.<ref>Price (2002) p 44\u201345. Price also noted previous studies that showed that military brats had \"a lower level of some childhood disorders such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD.)\"</ref>\n\nTeenage years are typically a period when people establish independence by taking some risks away from their parents. When the teenager lives in a \"fish-bowl community,\" a small self-contained community such as a base, challenging boundaries may be more difficult. Brats know that misbehavior or rebellious activity will be reported to their parents.<ref name = \"eakin 25\">Eakin (1998) p 25</ref> Brats are sometimes under constant pressure to conform to what military culture expects; this means they are sometimes seen as being more mature in their youth than their peers. If they grow up overseas or on military bases, they might have limited opportunities to see a wide range of role models in different professions.<ref name=\"Eakin1\">Eakin (1998) p 20</ref>\n\nStrict discipline can have the opposite effect: brats may rebel or behave in adolescent manners well beyond what is normally considered acceptable.<ref name=\"Cottrell1993\">Cottrell, Ann and Ruth Hill Useem (1993).

Retrieved January 5, 2007.</ref> Others develop psychological problems due to the intense stress of always being on their best behavior.<ref name=\"Wertsch3132\" />\n\n===Military classism===\n\nMilitary life is strictly [[Geographical segregation|segregated]] by [[Military rank|rank]];<ref name = \"protocol\">Cline (1995) p 82. \"Protocol is not intended to promote snobbery; it is a courtesy designed to recognize official status and give respect to those who, by their achievements, time in service, and experience, deserve it. And the exercise of that most certainly extends to spouses.\"</ref> the facilities provided for officers and enlisted personnel differ dramatically. The officers' housing will generally be more accessible to base activities, larger in size, and better [[landscape architecture|landscaped]]. On larger bases, the officers' housing may be broken down into different categories, with senior officers receiving larger and more opulent housing; sometimes, the highest-ranking officers live in a row of large houses often referred to as \"Colonels'/Captains' Row\" or \"Generals'/Admirals' Row,\" as the case may be.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Officer Clubs are more elegant than the Enlisted Clubs. Officers have cleaner, more elaborate recreational facilities than their enlisted counterparts. Historically, base [[chapel]]s and movie theaters would have designated seating for officers and their families. For a part of the 20th century, some bases had two [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and two [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]] troops\u2014one for officer children and one for enlisted children.<ref name=\"Wertsch 290\">Wertsch (1991), p. 290.</ref>\n\nThese differences are not merely external, but a core aspect of military life.<ref name=\"Wertsch 290\" /> Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers are afraid to upset the officers.<ref>Wertsch (1991), p 297. One interviewee said \"You could always tell the son of the [Commanding Officer]. He was the [[American football|football]] star, he had good grades.\"</ref> The physical separation and differences between available activities make it very difficult.<ref>Truscott (1989) p 168. \"Privileges accorded by rank were highly visible ... And all military brats, no matter where their father had fit in the hierarchy of rank, emphasized, over and over, that rank was pervasive and clearly defined.\"</ref> Most military brats on a personal level do not let this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's pay grade or rank.\n\nThe separation by rank has the intended purpose of maintaining military discipline among service members. According to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, it can be illegal for an officer to [[fraternize]] with an enlisted person because it would erode the military hierarchy. This is often conveyed to the children of military personnel. Two brats whose parents have a subordinate-supervisory relationship can cause problems for both their parents.<ref>Wertsch (1991), pp. 285\u2013288.</ref>\n\nTo a lesser degree, military classism also includes the branch of service to which the military parent belongs. If asked to name \"the best branch of service,\" military brats will almost invariably name the one to which their parent belonged. They will be able to articulate many reasons why \"their\" branch of the service is the best. These biases are maintained well past the time they cease to be [[military dependent]]s. When brats grow up, these boundaries are replaced by a shared identity based upon that of being a military brat.<ref>Wertsch (1991), pp. 314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nWhile a class hierarchy is reflected in stratified housing structures, military classism differs from traditional class structures in some significant ways \u2013 namely, schooling and access to quality healthcare. Children of military personnel attend the same base schools regardless of rank, creating peer cultures that are usually not class-based, and providing equal access to educational resources. Similarly, all military personnel receive the same quality of healthcare by the same providers.\n\n===Anti-racism===\nIn 1948, nearly 20 years before the [[civil rights movement]] swept through the non-military segments of U.S. society, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. It outlawed segregation in the military and made it illegal, per military law, to make a [[racism|racist]] remark.<ref name=\"bojh\"/> Fifteen years later, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] issued Department of Defense [[Directive 5120.36]]. \"Every military commander,\" the Directive mandates, \"has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off-duty hours.\"<ref>Department of Defense Directive 5120.36</ref> The directive was issued in 1963, but it was not until 1967 that the first non-military installation was declared off-limits to military personnel due to its discriminatory practices.<ref>Antecol, Heather and Deborah Cobb-Clark, [http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/spring06/ped/HeatherAntecol5-1-2006.pdf Racial and Ethnic Harassment in Local Communities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830080558/http://www.economics.ucr.edu/seminars/spring06/ped/HeatherAntecol5-1-2006.pdf |date=2006-08-30 }} Oct 4, 2005. p 8. Retrieved on January 1, 2007.</ref> While these directives did not eliminate all racism in the military, they continue to affect the culture in which children of military personnel grow up.<ref name=\"bojh\"/>\n\nWhen families go overseas, minority students rarely experience overt racism from their [[expatriate]] neighbors.<ref>Eakin (1998) p 56</ref> This is also true on military bases within the U.S.; as the diverse and more integrated military base community is isolated from the off-base community, and seen as the primary community, outside communities being secondary, military dependents are less likely to resort to racist notions. The bonds of the military community are normally seen by military dependents as being stronger bonds than the differences of race. Military brats grow up in a setting that actively condemns racist comments. This results in brats who \"aren't just non-racist, but anti-racist.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Growing up military==\n\n===Effect of mobile lifestyle on friendships===\n[[Image:Yokota cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|right|American military brat cheerleaders at a game at [[Yokota High School]], a U.S. Department of Defense school on an American Air Force base in [[Yokota Air Base|Yokota]], Japan]]\n\nBecause military brats are constantly making new friends to replace the ones that they have lost,<ref>Quigley, Samantha (25 April 2006). \"Author Explains Culture for Fellow Military Brats.\" American Forces Press Service</ref><ref>Pinzur, Matthew (Feb 19, 2000) [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/022000/met_2186291.html \"Adult 'Brats' Wander: Military Lifestyle Becomes Ingrained.\"] ''The Florida Times-Union''.

He interviewed and sent questionnaires to over 600 brats who belonged to various brat organizations and responded to his newspaper and internet ads. His study revealed that 97% lived in at least one foreign country, 63% in two, 31% in three. They averaged eight moves before graduating from high school and spent an average of seven years in foreign countries.

These are echoed in other literature of the Cold War, such as [[Pat Conroy]]'s ''[[The Great Santini (novel)|The Great Santini]]''. In the 1980s and 1990s the U.S. military focused on the issues of abuse and alcoholism. The impact on the military's efforts remains inconclusive. Some studies report higher rates of abuse in military families, while others report lower rates.<ref name = \"rentz\" />\n\nThe studies that conclude abuse is a bigger problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse because of the potential impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members are more likely to be ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.<ref name = \"rentz\">Rentz ED, Martin SL, Gibbs DA, et al. \"Family Violence in the Military: A review of the Literature.\" ''Trauma Violence, and Abuse.'' 2006 Apr;7(2):93\u2013108. {{DOI|10.1177/1524838005285916}} {{PMID|16534146}} p 94\u201395</ref>\n\n==Current military brats==\nIn 2010, the U.S. Defense Department reported that there were currently 2 million American children and teenagers who have had at least one parent deployed in a war zone in the then-current [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] conflicts.<ref name=\"wilson\">Wilson, Elaine, \"Military Teens Cope With Wartime Challenges\", American Forces Press Service, Department of Defense, FORT CAMPBELL, Ky., April 22, 2010 http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0410_military child/military-teens.html</ref> Over 900,000 have had a parent deployed multiple times.<ref name=\"wilson\" />\n\nMost of the research into military brats has been conducted on the long-term effects on adults who grew up during the Cold War and also during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Korean War|Korean]] wars. As the Cold War came to an end, the role of the United States Armed Forces changed. The U.S. military realized that there was distinct correlation between the quality of life and retention and operational effectiveness. To this end, the military started to change the living standards that most Cold War brats grew up with. The demographics of the military changed. The modern military has a larger proportion of married military members. Since base housing is designed for fewer families, more families are forced to live off-base.\n\nMilitary personnel are now being supplemented by more civilians filling essential roles, and the introduction of large megabases that intermesh different service branches and their individual cultures has also affected the demographics.<ref name=\"McClure473\">McClure, Peggy and Walter Broughton (2000) \"Measuring the Cohesion of Military Communities.\" ''Armed Forces & Society,'' Vol 26 No 3, Spring 2000. p. 473</ref> Finally, during the post-Cold War period, the United States has been involved in three extended military engagements (two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan).

For example, it is estimated that approximately 50,000 military families have both parents serving in the armed forces; this creates the possibility that both parents may be deployed at the same time.<ref name=\"Lamberg1541\">Lamberg, Lynne (2004) \"When Military Parents are sent to War, Children Left Behind Need Ample Support\".

With the advent of the [[Internet]] it is possible for family members to communicate with servicemen in combat zones. This allows brats to remain in closer contact with their military parent(s), but it also increases tension as more details reach the military families. Round-the-clock news agencies, such as [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]], spread news faster than the military bureaucracy can process the details. This means that military families know that servicemen have died before official word reaches the family. Military psychiatrist Colonel Stephen Cozza says that a \"sense of fear\" accompanies news of the death of a service member until confirmation that the service member was not a loved one.<ref name=\"Cozza 377\">Cozza SJ, Chun RS, Polo JA.

Boys and younger children do show the most risk when a parent is deployed, but rarely does this require clinical intervention. However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.<ref>Cozza SJ, Chun RS, Polo JA.

Military brats can feel a \"sense of euphoria\" when they discover that other brats share the same feelings and emotions. According to the study, brats share a bond with one another through common experiences that transcends race, religion, and nationality.<ref name=\"The Military Brats Seal\"/> Another common theme behind their joining brat organizations is to stay connected or reconnect with their old friends.\nWith all the focus on veterans, the children are left to grow up in sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one might think that there would be inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book ''Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress''.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted. New numbers were published once a day in the afternoon. Starting 17 March 2020, new numbers are published at midnight (0:00) for the previous day.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Germany medical

without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March.

Local ([[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]]e / [[Districts of Germany|Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte]]) health departments initially reported data to the federal country health department which transferred data to the nations federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal country health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

He recorded many studio albums under that record label from 1951 through 1956, as well as ''[[Blue Moods]]'', issued by [[Debut Records]] in 1955, and three sessions for [[Blue Note Records]]. The earliest Davis music released was recorded from April 4, 1945 through August 14, 1947, and reissued in CD format by [[Savoy Records]] under the title ''[[First Miles]]''.\nFrom 1949 through 1950, Davis recorded twelve tunes with a [[nonet (music)|nonet]] consisting of other noted jazz musicians including arranger [[Gil Evans]], [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Lee Konitz]], John Lewis, Max Roach and [[Kenny Clarke]]. The arrangements for that group were scored for instruments rarely used in jazz such as [[French horn]] and [[tuba]]. These recordings, which were labeled [[cool jazz]] and eventually appeared on the album ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' in 1957 by [[Capitol Records]], marked an important influence on the future jazz.<ref name=\"Birth of the Cool\">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/birth-of-the-cool-r104727|publisher=Rovi Corporation|work=Allmusic|accessdate=June 18, 2011|title=Birth of the Cool \u2013 Allmusic}}</ref> He later signed to [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and released ''[['Round About Midnight]]'' on March 18, 1957.
