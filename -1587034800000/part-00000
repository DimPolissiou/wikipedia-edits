Since 1974, Block has worked as [[director of photography]] on more than a hundred [[Cinematography|cinema]] and television [[Video production|productions]], and lectured on film [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] at several academies. From 1997 to 2015, Block held the position of applied visual arts professor at the [[University of Television and Film Munich]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\nHe was already interested in cinematography at the age of 13, and making amateur movies.<ref>[https://www.kameramann.de/technik/geehrt-fuer-das-lebenswerk-axel-block/ ''Geehrt f\u00fcr das Lebenswerk: Axel Block'']. Retrieved January 16, 2019.</ref> Upon successful completion of his school-leaving qualifications, Block served an apprenticeship as a photographer. In 1968, he was offered admission to the newly founded University of Television and Film in [[M\u00fcnchen]] to train as a film director. Due to his photography expertise, Block was employed as a cameraman whilst still at college.\n\nShortly after graduation, Block started working as associate and [[assistant director]]. He began his collaboration with the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] in 1974 on the feature ''No Reason to Worry'', which reinforced his decision to pursue a career as a cinematographer. In the following years, Block continued working for television studios; he filmed ''[[Out of the Hitler Time|When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit]]'' directed by {{Ill|Ilse Hofmann|de}} and the ''[[Auf Achse (TV series)|Auf Achse]]'' series. In 1981, Block was nominated a principal cinematographer for ''[[Tatort]]: {{Interlanguage link multi|Duisburg-Ruhrort (Tatort)|de|3=Tatort: Duisburg-Ruhrort|lt=Duisburg-Ruhrort}}'' thriller, in which [[Horst Schimanski]], a detective chief inspector, made his first appearance. Subsequently, Block was involved in the production of six more ''Tatort'' movies, three episodes of the ''Schimanski'' crime series from 1987 to the late 1990s, and a cinema film ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Zabou (film)|de|3=Zabou (Film)|lt=Tatort: Zabou}}'' in 1987.\n\nFrom the early 1980s, Block was increasingly involved in film productions. Some of his most popular works include:\n\n*The film adaptation of Klaus Mann's novel ''[[Flight North]]'' (1986; director: {{ill|Ingemo Engstr\u00f6m|de}})\n*''[[The Passenger \u2013 Welcome to Germany]]'' (1988; director: [[Thomas Brasch]])\n*''[[Go Trabi Go]]'' (1991; director: {{ill|Peter Timm|de}})\n*''[[Der Kinoerz\u00e4hler]]'' (\u2018\u2019The Movie Teller\u2019\u2019; 1993; director: [[Bernhard Sinkel]])\n*''[[I Am the Other Woman]]'' (2006; director: [[Margarethe von Trotta]])\n*''[[Vision (film)|Vision \u2013 From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen]]'' (2009; director: Margarethe von Trotta)\n\nIn 1990, Axel Block won the [[Deutscher Filmpreis|German Movie Award]] and [[Bavarian Film Awards|Bavarian Film Award]] for his cinematography in the 1989 documentary ''[[American Beauty Ltd.]]''. Having already received the Promotional German Cinematography Award in 1984, Block was honored for his lifetime achievement in 2011.<ref>''[http://www.presseportal.de/pm/7899/2047546/wdr_westdeutscher_rundfunk \"Unverwechselbare Bildsprache\": Der DEUTSCHE KAMERAPREIS 2011 ehrt Axel Block]'', WDR press release, May 19, 2011.</ref>\n\nBesides his freelance work as a cinematographer, Block served as an associate professor from 1975 onwards. He taught at the [[University of Television and Film Munich]], the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|German Film and Television Academy Berlin]], and the [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]]. In addition, Block held a professorship at the [[Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts]] from 1994 to 1997. In 1997, he returned to the University of Television and Film Munich as a professor of applied aesthetics, pictoral design, and camera technology, holding the chair of \"Applied Visual Arts\" until his retirement in 2015.<ref>[https://www.digitalproduction.com/2014/12/03/hff-muenchen-sucht-professorin-fuer-kinematographie/ \u201cHFF M\u00fcnchen sucht Professor/in f\u00fcr Kinematographie\u201d].

He graduated in 1987. In addition to his main subject, [[drama]], he also took courses in [[tap dancing]], [[ballet]], and [[singing]].\n\nBetween 1987 and 2006, Ferch lived in [[Berlin]], a city whose division after [[World War II]] and reunification in 1989 is repeatedly reflected in his work as a movie actor (''Menteurs, \u201eThe Tunnel, Mord am Meer, The Airlift, The Wall - Berlin 1961'' and ''The Miracle of Berlin''). After his wedding in 2005, he moved his main residence to [[Bavaria]].\n \nUntil 1999, he was in a nine-year relationship with actress [[Suzanne von Borsody]] but in 2000 he met Dr. Julia von Pufendorf, the daughter of the former under-secretary of state for cultural affairs for the city of Berlin.

As a member of the stage ballet company in the musical [[Can-Can]], he performed the tumbling acrobatics at the [[Stadttheater Bremerhaven]] in his home town. During this time, he also traveled through Europe as a federal member of the National League of Gymnastics.\n\nFerch studied acting at the University of Music and Performing Arts \"[[Mozarteum]]\" in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. He graduated in 1987. In addition to his main subject, [[drama]], he also took courses in [[tap dancing]], [[ballet]], and [[singing]].\n\nBetween 1987 and 2006, Ferch lived in [[Berlin]], a city whose division after [[World War II]] and reunification in 1989 is repeatedly reflected in his work as a movie actor (''Menteurs, \u201eThe Tunnel, Mord am Meer, The Airlift, The Wall - Berlin 1961'' and ''The Miracle of Berlin''). After his wedding in 2005, he moved his main residence to [[Bavaria]].\n \nUntil 1999, he was in a nine-year relationship with actress [[Suzanne von Borsody]] but in 2000 he met Dr. Julia von Pufendorf, the daughter of the former under-secretary of state for cultural affairs for the city of Berlin. From this relationship, he fathered a daughter (Louisa, born 2000).\n\nIn 2002, Ferch met Marie-Jeanette Steinle, a National League Member of the military eventing squad, at the Bavarian Television Award celebration.\n\nThree years later, in 2005, Ferch and Steinle married during the world's biggest sailing ship unification event, ''Sail 2005''. The ceremony took place in the captain's lounge of the three-mast sailing ship [[Dar M\u0142odzie\u017cy]] in Bremerhaven. A church wedding followed ten days later in Munster ''St. Maria Ascension'' in Die\u00dfen, Bavarian Ammersee. On 10 November 2008 Marie-Jeanette and Heino Ferch became parents to a daughter named Ava Vittoria Merced\u00e8s.

He became experienced in the radical extended [[Wertheim-Meigs operation|Wertheim hysterectomy]] for treating [[cervical cancer]], performing more than 500 of these in his lifetime.\n\nPersonal tragedy directed Bonney towards conservative surgery and he became a pioneer in the field of the less drastic procedures of [[ovarian cyst#Surgery|ovarian cystectomy]] for removing [[ovarian cysts]] and the [[myomectomy]] for removing [[uterine fibroids]]. Its preference over [[hysterectomy]] preserved the [[fertility]] of many women of reproductive age. He developed a surgical clamp to reduce [[Myomectomy#Complications and risks|post-myomectomy]] [[haemorrhage]], established operative techniques to reduce [[Postoperative hematoma|post-operative haematomas]] and modified the Reverdin needle.\n\nIn addition, he wrote more than 200 medical papers and co-authored and illustrated ''A Textbook of Gynaecological Surgery'' (1911), still in print in 2004 as ''Bonney's Gynaecological Surgery''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nVictor Bonney was born on 17 December 1872 at Chelsea.

Sir [[John Bland-Sutton]] then invited him to the [[Chelsea Hospital for Women]], where he became a gynaecologist. He was awarded with [[MBBS]] in 1896, and [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] two years later. In 1899, he was awarded with the [[Master of Surgery]] and subsequently became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1899.<ref name=\"BJOGObit1953\" /> He was accepted as a fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] the following year.<ref name=Livesonline/>\n\n== Early surgical training ==\nIn 1901 he was an assistant physician and held residential posts at [[Queen Charlotte's Hospital]], the Middlesex Hospital and Chelsea hospitals. Subsequently, he studied [[anatomy]] at [[London University]] and achieved a BSc with first-class honours in 1904. A year later, he became obstetric registrar and tutor at the Middlesex and in 1908 he was elected assistant gynaecological surgeon.<ref name=Livesonline/>\n\n==Surgical career==\nBonney, subsequently spent the next four decades developing techniques in [[Gynecologic oncology|gynaecological cancer]] surgery, operations that conserved fertility, antiseptic techniques, after care of the [[bowel]] following pelvic surgery and advocating [[Lower segment Caesarean section]] as an alternative to traditional [[caesarian section]]. He was acknowledged for his speed and utilised two chauffeur driven cars when travelling to perform surgery in peoples private homes and nursing homes, with one car transporting the operating equipment ahead of his arrival. He also had his own operating clothing which was washed at home. His surgical operations were not merely confined to the pelvis; gynaecologist and historian, professor [[Geoffrey Chamberlain]], reported in his biography of Bonney in 2000 that Bonney had also performed fourteen [[mastectomies|breast removals]], eight [[cholecystectomies|gallbladder excisions]] and five varicose vein resections.<ref name=Siegler2001/> Bonney also had the experience, with his colleague Berkeley, of operating on thousands of wounded soldiers who arrived at Clacton, Essex throughout the [[First World War]], procedures including extracting bullets, and shrapnel.<ref name=\"Philipp2001\" />\n\nChamberlain also later described Bonney as \"a primary influence on world gynaecology in the years between the wars\".<ref name=\"Chamberlain2000\">Chamberlain, Victor.

He became experienced in the radical extended [[Wertheim-Meigs operation|Wertheim hysterectomy]] for treating [[cervical cancer]], performing more than 500 of these in his lifetime.\n\nPersonal tragedy directed Bonney towards conservative surgery and he became a pioneer in the field of the less drastic procedures of [[ovarian cyst#Surgery|ovarian cystectomy]] for removing [[ovarian cysts]] and the [[myomectomy]] for removing [[uterine fibroids]]. Its preference over [[hysterectomy]] preserved the [[fertility]] of many women of reproductive age. He developed a surgical clamp to reduce [[Myomectomy#Complications and risks|post-myomectomy]] [[haemorrhage]], established operative techniques to reduce [[Postoperative hematoma|post-operative haematomas]] and modified the Reverdin needle.\n\nIn addition, he wrote more than 200 medical papers and co-authored and illustrated ''A Textbook of Gynaecological Surgery'' (1911), still in print in 2004 as ''Bonney's Gynaecological Surgery''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nVictor Bonney was born on 17 December 1872 at Chelsea.

Sir [[John Bland-Sutton]] then invited him to the [[Chelsea Hospital for Women]], where he became a gynaecologist. He was awarded with [[MBBS]] in 1896, and [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] two years later.

A year later, he became obstetric registrar and tutor at the Middlesex and in 1908 he was elected assistant gynaecological surgeon.<ref name=Livesonline/>\n\n==Surgical career==\nBonney, subsequently spent the next four decades developing techniques in [[Gynecologic oncology|gynaecological cancer]] surgery, operations that conserved fertility, antiseptic techniques, after care of the [[bowel]] following pelvic surgery and advocating [[Lower segment Caesarean section]] as an alternative to traditional [[caesarian section]]. He was acknowledged for his speed and utilised two chauffeur driven cars when travelling to perform surgery in peoples private homes and nursing homes, with one car transporting the operating equipment ahead of his arrival. He also had his own operating clothing which was washed at home. His surgical operations were not merely confined to the pelvis; gynaecologist and historian, professor [[Geoffrey Chamberlain]], reported in his biography of Bonney in 2000 that Bonney had also performed fourteen [[mastectomies|breast removals]], eight [[cholecystectomies|gallbladder excisions]] and five varicose vein resections.<ref name=Siegler2001/> Bonney also had the experience, with his colleague Berkeley, of operating on thousands of wounded soldiers who arrived at Clacton, Essex throughout the [[First World War]], procedures including extracting bullets, and shrapnel.<ref name=\"Philipp2001\" />\n\nChamberlain also later described Bonney as \"a primary influence on world gynaecology in the years between the wars\".<ref name=\"Chamberlain2000\">Chamberlain, Victor.
