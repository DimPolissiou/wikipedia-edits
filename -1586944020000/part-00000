In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Garbo fifth on their list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema]]. For most of her career she was known for her melancholy and somber persona due her many portrayals of tragic characters in her films.\n\nGarbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film ''[[The Saga of G\u00f6sta Berling]]''. Her performance caught the attention of [[Louis B. Mayer]], chief executive of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She stirred interest with her first American silent film, ''[[Torrent (1926 film)|Torrent]]'' (1926). Garbo\u2019s performance in ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1927), her third movie, made her an international star.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=38}}\n\nGarbo's first talking film was ''[[Anna Christie (1930 English-language film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930). MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline \"Garbo talks!\" That same year, she starred in ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]''. For her performances in these films, she received the first of three [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] nominations for best actress. Academy rules at the time allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for his or her work in more than one film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1377809209073|title=Session Timeout \u2013 Academy Awards\u00ae Database \u2013 AMPAS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103052915/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1377809209073|archivedate=3 November 2013}}</ref> In 1932, her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract, and she became increasingly selective about her roles. She continued in films such as ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931), ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1931), ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933), and ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935).\n\nMany critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan [[The Lady of the Camellias|Marguerite Gautier]] in ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) to be her finest. The role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. However, Garbo's career soon declined and she was one of the many stars labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]] in 1938. Her career revived upon her turn to comedy in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939) which earned her a third Academy Award nomination, but after the failure of ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), she retired from the screen, at the age of 35, after acting in 28 films.\n\nAfter retiring, Garbo declined all opportunities to return to the screen.

[[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m|Victor Seastrom]], a respected Swedish director at MGM, was a friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one,{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=72\u201374}} Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer, but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of ''G\u00f6sta Berling''. He was immediately struck by Garbo's magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. \"It was her eyes\", his daughter recalled him saying, \"I can make a star out of her.\" In the second version,{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=80\u201383}} Mayer had already seen ''G\u00f6sta Berling'' before his Berlin trip, and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter: \"This director is wonderful, but what we really ought to look at is the girl...

She was paired opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] in ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1931), and her profile was used to boost the career of the relatively unknown [[Clark Gable]] in ''[[Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)]]'' (1931). Although the films did not match Garbo's success with her sound debut, she was ranked as the most popular female star in the United States in 1930 and 1931.\n\nGarbo followed with two of her best-remembered roles. She played the [[Mata Hari|World War I German spy]] in the lavish production of ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931), opposite [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]].

The film's screenplay had been written by [[Salka Viertel]]; although reluctant to make the movie, MGM relented at Garbo's insistence. For her leading man, MGM suggested [[Charles Boyer]] or [[Laurence Olivier]], but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]].

The movie, however, met with controversy upon its release; censors objected to the scenes in which Garbo disguised herself as a man and kissed a female co-star.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=572\u201373}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}}\n\nAlthough her domestic popularity was undiminished in the early 1930s, high profits for Garbo's films after ''Queen Christina'' depended on the foreign market for their success.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=572\u201373}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}} The type of historical and melodramatic films she began to make on the advice of Viertel were highly successful abroad, but considerably less so in the United States. In the midst of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], American screen audiences seemed to favor \"home-grown\" screen couples, such as [[Clark Gable]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. [[David O. Selznick]] wanted to cast Garbo as the dying heiress in ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (eventually released in 1939 with other leads), but she chose [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935), in which she played another of her renowned roles.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|pp=207\u201310}} Her performance won her the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]]. The film was successful in international markets, and had better domestic rentals than MGM anticipated.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=172, 571}} Still, its profit was significantly diminished because of Garbo's exorbitant salary.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=216}}\n\nGarbo selected [[George Cukor]]'s romantic drama ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) as her next project. Thalberg cast her opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and former co-star, [[Lionel Barrymore]]. Cukor carefully crafted Garbo's portrayal of Marguerite Gautier, a lower-class woman, who becomes the world-renowned mistress Camille. Production was marred, however, by the sudden death of Thalberg, then only thirty-seven, which plunged the Hollywood studios into a \"state of profound shock\", writes [[David Bret]].<ref name=Bret/>{{rp|272}} Garbo had grown close to Thalberg and his wife, [[Norma Shearer]], and had often dropped by their house unannounced. Her grief for Thalberg, some believe, was more profound than for [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], who died earlier that same year.<ref name=Bret>Bret, David. ''Greta Garbo: Divine Star'', Robson Press (2012)</ref>{{rp|272}} His death also added to the sombre mood required for the closing scenes of ''Camille''. When the film premiered in New York on 12 December 1936, it became an international success, Garbo's first major success in three years. She won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] for her performance, and she was nominated once more for an Academy Award.\n[[File:Modern Screen 1937 Conquest.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Garbo and [[Charles Boyer]] in ''[[Conquest (1937 film)|Conquest]]'' (1937)]]\nGarbo's follow-up project was [[Clarence Brown]]'s lavish production of ''[[Conquest (1937 film)|Conquest]]'' (1937), opposite [[Charles Boyer]]. The plot was the dramatized romance between [[Napoleon]] and [[Marie Walewska]]. It was MGM's biggest and most-publicized movie of its year, but upon its release, it lost more than  million at the box-office, becoming one of the studio's biggest failures of the decade.{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}} Garbo's popularity had declined, and when her contract expired soon thereafter, she returned briefly to Sweden. On 3 May 1938, Garbo was among the many stars\u2014including [[Joan Crawford]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Mae West]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Fred Astaire]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], among others\u2014dubbed to be \"[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]\" in an article published by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners of America.\n\nAfter the box-office failure of ''Conquest'', MGM decided a change of pace was needed to resurrect Garbo's career. For her next movie, the studio teamed her with producer-director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] to film ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939), her first comedy. The film was one of the first Hollywood movies which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]] as being rigid and gray when compared to its pre-war years. ''Ninotchka'' premiered in October 1939, publicized with the catchphrase \"Garbo laughs!\", commenting on the departure of Garbo's serious and melancholy image as she transferred to comedy. Favoured by critics and box-office success in the United States and abroad, it was banned in the Soviet Union.\n\n===Last work, and early retirement (1941\u20131948)===\n[[File:twofaced woman.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Garbo and [[Melvyn Douglas]] in ''Two-Faced Woman'' (1941)]]With [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo's success in ''Ninotchka'' by re-teaming her with Melvyn Douglas in another romantic comedy which sought to transform her into a chic, modern woman. She played a \"double\" role that featured her dancing the [[rhumba]], swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical failure, but, contrary to popular belief, it performed reasonably well at the box office.{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=573}} Garbo referred to the film as \"my grave\".{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=129}} ''Two-Faced Woman'' was her last film; she was thirty-six, and had made twenty-eight feature films in 16 years.\n\nAlthough Garbo was humiliated by the negative reviews of ''Two-Faced Woman'', she did not intend to retire at first.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=381}}{{Sfn|Vieira|1994|p=267}} But her films depended on the European market, and when it fell through because of the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=281}} Garbo signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make ''The Girl from Leningrad'', but the project quickly dissolved.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}} She still thought she would continue when the war was over,{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=383}} though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. [[Salka Viertel]], Garbo's close friend and collaborator, said in 1945: \"Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she's afraid of it.\"{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=270}} Garbo also worried about her age. \"Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It's not the same anymore, being able to pull it off.\"{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=270}} George Cukor, director of ''Two-Faced Woman'', and often blamed for its failure, said: \"People often glibly say that the failure of ''Two-Faced Woman'' finished Garbo's career. That's a grotesque over-simplification. It certainly threw her, but I think that what really happened was that she just gave up. She didn't want to go on.\"{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=383}}\n\nStill, Garbo signed a contract in 1948 with producer [[Walter Wanger]], who had produced ''Queen Christina'', to shoot a picture based on [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''La Duchesse de Langeais''. [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] was slated to adapt and direct.<ref name=\"Reid2006p44\" /><ref name=\"Kellow2004p338\" /><ref name=\"ForrestKoos2002p151-152\" /> She made several [[screen test]]s, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize, and the project was abandoned.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=130}} The screen tests\u2014the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera\u2014were thought to have been lost for 41 years until they were re-discovered in 1990 by film historians [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Jeanine Basinger]].{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=426}} Parts of the footage were included in the 2005 [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] documentary ''Garbo''.<ref name=\"TCM-GarboDoc\" />\n\nIn 1949, she was offered the role of fictional silent-film star Norma Desmond in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

In the few instances when she did accept them, the slightest problem led her to drop out.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=271}} Although she refused to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring throughout her life, four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: \"I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio... I really wanted to live another life.\"{{Sfn|Broman|1990|p=271}}\n\n===Public persona===\nFrom the early days of her career, Garbo avoided industry social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}}<ref name=\"NYT-GarboBack-smokinglounge\" /> Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated.{{Sfn|Krutzen|1992|p=46}} Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine,{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=129, 156\u201357, 243}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=196}} and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating, \"As early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, don't like many people.\"<ref>Biery, April 1928</ref>\n\nBecause Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood's publicity rules. She was routinely referred to by the press as the \"Swedish Sphinx\". Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique that she projected both on screen and in real life. MGM eventually capitalized on it, for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=179}}{{Sfn|Krutzen|1992|p=46}}{{Sfn|Swensen|1997|pp=196\u201397}} In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century's most publicized women in the world.{{sfn|NYTimes|1990}}{{sfn|Barnes|1990}} She is closely associated with a line from ''Grand Hotel'', one which the [[American Film Institute]] in 2005 voted the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|30th-most memorable movie quote of all time]],<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> \"I want to be alone; I just want to be alone.\" The theme was a running gag that began during the period of her silent movies.<ref name=\"NYT-Obit-let-alone\">{{Harvnb|NYTimes|1990}}.

I liked history best, but I was afraid of the map\u2014geography you call it. But I had to go to school like other children. The public school, just as you have in this country.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biery1928a-noplay\">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. I didn't play much. Except skating and skiing and throwing snowballs. I did most of my playing by thinking. I played a little with my brother and sister, pretending we were in shows. Like other children. But usually, I did my own pretending. I was up and down. Very happy one moment, the next moment \u2013 there was nothing left for me.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biery1928a-sixorseven\">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. Then I found a theater. I must have been six or seven. Two theaters, really. One was a cabaret; one a regular theater, \u2013 across from one another. And there was a back porch to both of them. A long plank on which the actors and actresses walked to get in the back door. I used to go there at seven o'clock in the evening, when they would be coming in, and wait until eight-thirty. Watch them come in; listen to them getting ready. The big back door was always open even in the coldest weather. Listen to their voices doing their parts in the productions. Smell the greasepaint! There is no smell in the world like the smell of the backyard of a theater. No smell that will mean as much to me\u2014ever. Night after night, I sat there dreaming. Dreaming when I would be inside\u2014getting ready.</ref><ref name=\"Biery1928c-Stiller-artist\">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928c|p=}}. Mr. Stiller is an artist. He does not understand the American factories. He has always made his own pictures in Europe, where he is the master. In our country it is always the small studio. He does not understand the American Business. He could speak no English. So he was taken off the picture. It was given to Mr. Niblo. How I was broken to pieces, nobody knows. I was so unhappy I did not think I could go on.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Brown1965\">{{Cite book|first=John Mason|last=Brown|title=The worlds of Robert E.

In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Garbo fifth on their list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema]]. For most of her career she was known for her melancholy and somber persona due her many portrayals of tragic characters in her films.\n\nGarbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film ''[[The Saga of G\u00f6sta Berling]]''. Her performance caught the attention of [[Louis B. Mayer]], chief executive of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She stirred interest with her first American silent film, ''[[Torrent (1926 film)|Torrent]]'' (1926). Garbo\u2019s performance in ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1927), her third movie, made her an international star.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=38}}\n\nGarbo's first talking film was ''[[Anna Christie (1930 English-language film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930). MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline \"Garbo talks!\" That same year, she starred in ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]''. For her performances in these films, she received the first of three [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] nominations for best actress. Academy rules at the time allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for his or her work in more than one film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1377809209073|title=Session Timeout \u2013 Academy Awards\u00ae Database \u2013 AMPAS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103052915/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1377809209073|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1932, her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract, and she became increasingly selective about her roles. She continued in films such as ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931), ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1931), ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933), and ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935).\n\nMany critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan [[The Lady of the Camellias|Marguerite Gautier]] in ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) to be her finest. The role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. However, Garbo's career soon declined and she was one of the many stars labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]] in 1938. Her career revived upon her turn to comedy in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939) which earned her a third Academy Award nomination, but after the failure of ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), she retired from the screen, at the age of 35, after acting in 28 films.\n\nAfter retiring, Garbo declined all opportunities to return to the screen. Shunning publicity, she led a private life. Garbo was an art collector whose collection, including works from [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], and [[Kees van Dongen]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/19/arts/garbo-s-collection-and-a-van-gogh-are-to-be-sold.html |title=Garbo's Collection and a van Gogh Are to Be Sold |last=Reif |first=Rita |work=The New York Times |date=July 19, 1990 |accessdate=October 11, 2015}}</ref> was worth millions of dollars when she died.\n\n==Childhood and youth==\n[[File:Greta Garbo, S\u00f6dermalm.JPG|thumb|200px|Monument on the building which now stands where Greta Garbo was born in [[S\u00f6dermalm]].]]\nGreta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in [[S\u00f6dermalm]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

[[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m|Victor Seastrom]], a respected Swedish director at MGM, was a friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one,{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=72\u201374}} Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer, but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of ''G\u00f6sta Berling''. He was immediately struck by Garbo's magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. \"It was her eyes\", his daughter recalled him saying, \"I can make a star out of her.\" In the second version,{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=80\u201383}} Mayer had already seen ''G\u00f6sta Berling'' before his Berlin trip, and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter: \"This director is wonderful, but what we really ought to look at is the girl... The girl, look at the girl!\" After the screening, his daughter reported, he was unwavering: \"I'll take her without him. I'll take her ''with'' him.

Sixteen minutes into the film, she famously utters her first line, \"Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side, and don't be stingy, baby.\" The film premiered in [[New York City]] on 21 February 1930, publicized with the catchphrase \"Garbo talks!\", and was the highest-grossing film of the year.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=111}} Garbo received her first [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] nomination for her performance, although she lost to MGM colleague [[Norma Shearer]]. Her nomination that year included her performance in ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]'' (1930).After filming ended, Garbo\u2014along with a different director and cast\u2014filmed a [[German language|German-language]] version of ''[[Anna Christie (1931 film)|Anna Christie]]'' that was released in December 1930.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=570}} The film's success certified Garbo's successful transition to [[Sound film|talkies]]. In her follow-up film, ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]'' (1930), she portrayed an [[Italy|Italian]] [[opera]] star, opposite [[Lewis Stone]]. She was paired opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] in ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1931), and her profile was used to boost the career of the relatively unknown [[Clark Gable]] in ''[[Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)]]'' (1931). Although the films did not match Garbo's success with her sound debut, she was ranked as the most popular female star in the United States in 1930 and 1931.\n\nGarbo followed with two of her best-remembered roles. She played the [[Mata Hari|World War I German spy]] in the lavish production of ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931), opposite [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]]. When the film was released, it \"caused panic, with police reserves required to keep the waiting mob in order\".{{Sfn|qtd in Swenson|1997|p=266}} The following year, she played a [[Russia]]n ballerina in ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), opposite an ensemble cast, including [[John Barrymore]], [[Joan Crawford]], and [[Wallace Beery]], among others. The film won that year's [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Both films were MGM's highest-earning films of 1931 and 1932, respectively, and Garbo was dubbed \"the greatest money-making machine ever put on screen\".{{sfn|NYTimes|1990}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=244}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=284}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}Garbo's close friend [[Mercedes de Acosta]] then penned a screenplay for her to portray [[Joan of Arc]],{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=269\u201370}} but MGM rebuffed the idea, and the project was shelved. After appearing in ''[[As You Desire Me (film)|As You Desire Me]]'' (1932), the first of three films in which Garbo starred opposite [[Melvyn Douglas]], her MGM contract expired, and she returned to Sweden.\n\nAfter nearly a year of negotiations, Garbo agreed to renew her contract with MGM on the condition that she would star in ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933), and her salary would be increased to  per film. The film's screenplay had been written by [[Salka Viertel]]; although reluctant to make the movie, MGM relented at Garbo's insistence. For her leading man, MGM suggested [[Charles Boyer]] or [[Laurence Olivier]], but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]. The studio balked at the idea of casting Gilbert, fearing his declining career would hurt the film's box-office, but Garbo prevailed.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=183}}{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=181}}''Queen Christina'' was a lavish production, becoming one of the studio's biggest productions at the time. Publicized as \"Garbo returns\", the film premiered in December 1933 to positive reviews and box-office triumph, and became the highest-grossing film of the year. The movie, however, met with controversy upon its release; censors objected to the scenes in which Garbo disguised herself as a man and kissed a female co-star.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=572\u201373}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}}\n\nAlthough her domestic popularity was undiminished in the early 1930s, high profits for Garbo's films after ''Queen Christina'' depended on the foreign market for their success.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=572\u201373}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}} The type of historical and melodramatic films she began to make on the advice of Viertel were highly successful abroad, but considerably less so in the United States. In the midst of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], American screen audiences seemed to favor \"home-grown\" screen couples, such as [[Clark Gable]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. [[David O. Selznick]] wanted to cast Garbo as the dying heiress in ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (eventually released in 1939 with other leads), but she chose [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935), in which she played another of her renowned roles.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|pp=207\u201310}} Her performance won her the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]]. The film was successful in international markets, and had better domestic rentals than MGM anticipated.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=172, 571}} Still, its profit was significantly diminished because of Garbo's exorbitant salary.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=216}}\n\nGarbo selected [[George Cukor]]'s romantic drama ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) as her next project. Thalberg cast her opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and former co-star, [[Lionel Barrymore]]. Cukor carefully crafted Garbo's portrayal of Marguerite Gautier, a lower-class woman, who becomes the world-renowned mistress Camille. Production was marred, however, by the sudden death of Thalberg, then only thirty-seven, which plunged the Hollywood studios into a \"state of profound shock\", writes [[David Bret]].<ref name=Bret/>{{rp|272}} Garbo had grown close to Thalberg and his wife, [[Norma Shearer]], and had often dropped by their house unannounced. Her grief for Thalberg, some believe, was more profound than for [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], who died earlier that same year.<ref name=Bret>Bret, David. ''Greta Garbo: Divine Star'', Robson Press (2012)</ref>{{rp|272}} His death also added to the sombre mood required for the closing scenes of ''Camille''. When the film premiered in New York on 12 December 1936, it became an international success, Garbo's first major success in three years. She won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] for her performance, and she was nominated once more for an Academy Award.\n[[File:Modern Screen 1937 Conquest.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Garbo and [[Charles Boyer]] in ''[[Conquest (1937 film)|Conquest]]'' (1937)]]\nGarbo's follow-up project was [[Clarence Brown]]'s lavish production of ''[[Conquest (1937 film)|Conquest]]'' (1937), opposite [[Charles Boyer]]. The plot was the dramatized romance between [[Napoleon]] and [[Marie Walewska]]. It was MGM's biggest and most-publicized movie of its year, but upon its release, it lost more than  million at the box-office, becoming one of the studio's biggest failures of the decade.{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}} Garbo's popularity had declined, and when her contract expired soon thereafter, she returned briefly to Sweden. On 3 May 1938, Garbo was among the many stars\u2014including [[Joan Crawford]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Mae West]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Fred Astaire]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], among others\u2014dubbed to be \"[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]\" in an article published by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners of America.\n\nAfter the box-office failure of ''Conquest'', MGM decided a change of pace was needed to resurrect Garbo's career. For her next movie, the studio teamed her with producer-director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] to film ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939), her first comedy. The film was one of the first Hollywood movies which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]] as being rigid and gray when compared to its pre-war years. ''Ninotchka'' premiered in October 1939, publicized with the catchphrase \"Garbo laughs!\", commenting on the departure of Garbo's serious and melancholy image as she transferred to comedy. Favoured by critics and box-office success in the United States and abroad, it was banned in the Soviet Union.\n\n===Last work, and early retirement (1941\u20131948)===\n[[File:twofaced woman.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Garbo and [[Melvyn Douglas]] in ''Two-Faced Woman'' (1941)]]With [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo's success in ''Ninotchka'' by re-teaming her with Melvyn Douglas in another romantic comedy which sought to transform her into a chic, modern woman. She played a \"double\" role that featured her dancing the [[rhumba]], swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical failure, but, contrary to popular belief, it performed reasonably well at the box office.{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=573}} Garbo referred to the film as \"my grave\".{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=129}} ''Two-Faced Woman'' was her last film; she was thirty-six, and had made twenty-eight feature films in 16 years.\n\nAlthough Garbo was humiliated by the negative reviews of ''Two-Faced Woman'', she did not intend to retire at first.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=381}}{{Sfn|Vieira|1994|p=267}} But her films depended on the European market, and when it fell through because of the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=281}} Garbo signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make ''The Girl from Leningrad'', but the project quickly dissolved.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}} She still thought she would continue when the war was over,{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=383}} though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. [[Salka Viertel]], Garbo's close friend and collaborator, said in 1945: \"Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she's afraid of it.\"{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=270}} Garbo also worried about her age. \"Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It's not the same anymore, being able to pull it off.\"{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=270}} George Cukor, director of ''Two-Faced Woman'', and often blamed for its failure, said: \"People often glibly say that the failure of ''Two-Faced Woman'' finished Garbo's career. That's a grotesque over-simplification. It certainly threw her, but I think that what really happened was that she just gave up. She didn't want to go on.\"{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=383}}\n\nStill, Garbo signed a contract in 1948 with producer [[Walter Wanger]], who had produced ''Queen Christina'', to shoot a picture based on [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''La Duchesse de Langeais''. [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] was slated to adapt and direct.<ref name=\"Reid2006p44\" /><ref name=\"Kellow2004p338\" /><ref name=\"ForrestKoos2002p151-152\" /> She made several [[screen test]]s, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize, and the project was abandoned.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=130}} The screen tests\u2014the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera\u2014were thought to have been lost for 41 years until they were re-discovered in 1990 by film historians [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Jeanine Basinger]].{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=426}} Parts of the footage were included in the 2005 [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] documentary ''Garbo''.<ref name=\"TCM-GarboDoc\" />\n\nIn 1949, she was offered the role of fictional silent-film star Norma Desmond in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

In the few instances when she did accept them, the slightest problem led her to drop out.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=271}} Although she refused to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring throughout her life, four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: \"I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio... I really wanted to live another life.\"{{Sfn|Broman|1990|p=271}}\n\n===Public persona===\nFrom the early days of her career, Garbo avoided industry social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}}<ref name=\"NYT-GarboBack-smokinglounge\" /> Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated.{{Sfn|Krutzen|1992|p=46}} Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine,{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=129, 156\u201357, 243}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=196}} and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating, \"As early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, don't like many people.\"<ref>Biery, April 1928</ref>\n\nBecause Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood's publicity rules. She was routinely referred to by the press as the \"Swedish Sphinx\". Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique that she projected both on screen and in real life. MGM eventually capitalized on it, for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=179}}{{Sfn|Krutzen|1992|p=46}}{{Sfn|Swensen|1997|pp=196\u201397}} In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century's most publicized women in the world.{{sfn|NYTimes|1990}}{{sfn|Barnes|1990}} She is closely associated with a line from ''Grand Hotel'', one which the [[American Film Institute]] in 2005 voted the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|30th-most memorable movie quote of all time]],<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> \"I want to be alone; I just want to be alone.\" The theme was a running gag that began during the period of her silent movies.<ref name=\"NYT-Obit-let-alone\">{{Harvnb|NYTimes|1990}}.

When I wasn't thinking, wasn't wondering what it was all about, this living; I was dreaming. Dreaming how I could become a player.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biery1928a-hatesc\">\n{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. I hated school. I hated the bonds they put on me. There were so many things outside. I liked history best, but I was afraid of the map\u2014geography you call it. But I had to go to school like other children. The public school, just as you have in this country.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biery1928a-noplay\">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. I didn't play much. Except skating and skiing and throwing snowballs. I did most of my playing by thinking. I played a little with my brother and sister, pretending we were in shows. Like other children. But usually, I did my own pretending. I was up and down. Very happy one moment, the next moment \u2013 there was nothing left for me.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biery1928a-sixorseven\">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. Then I found a theater. I must have been six or seven. Two theaters, really. One was a cabaret; one a regular theater, \u2013 across from one another. And there was a back porch to both of them. A long plank on which the actors and actresses walked to get in the back door. I used to go there at seven o'clock in the evening, when they would be coming in, and wait until eight-thirty. Watch them come in; listen to them getting ready. The big back door was always open even in the coldest weather. Listen to their voices doing their parts in the productions. Smell the greasepaint! There is no smell in the world like the smell of the backyard of a theater. No smell that will mean as much to me\u2014ever. Night after night, I sat there dreaming. Dreaming when I would be inside\u2014getting ready.</ref><ref name=\"Biery1928c-Stiller-artist\">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928c|p=}}. Mr. Stiller is an artist. He does not understand the American factories. He has always made his own pictures in Europe, where he is the master. In our country it is always the small studio. He does not understand the American Business. He could speak no English. So he was taken off the picture. It was given to Mr. Niblo. How I was broken to pieces, nobody knows. I was so unhappy I did not think I could go on.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Brown1965\">{{Cite book|first=John Mason|last=Brown|title=The worlds of Robert E.

He made wide-ranging reforms and mounted a comprehensive nation-building program in government, but his controversial handling of industrial relations led to a dramatic [[1929 Australian federal election|defeat at the polls in 1929]]. Bruce later pursued a long and influential diplomatic career as [[List of High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] (1933\u20131945) and chairman of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (1946\u20131951).\n\nBorn into a briefly wealthy [[Melbourne]] family, Bruce studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] and spent his early life tending to the importing and exporting business of his late father. He served on the front lines of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesperson for government recruitment efforts. He gained the attention of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], who encouraged a political career. He was elected to [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]] in 1918, becoming [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] in 1921 and then prime minister in 1923, at the head of a coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]].\n\nIn office Bruce pursued an energetic and diverse agenda. He comprehensively overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital city of [[Canberra]]. He implemented various reforms to the [[Federalism in Australia|Australian federal system]] to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth, and helped develop the forerunners of the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the [[CSIRO]]. Bruce's \"men, money and markets\" scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia's population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the [[British Empire]]. However, his endeavours to overhaul Australia's industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with the labour movement, and his radical proposal to abolish [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration|Commonwealth arbitration]] in 1929 prompted members of his own party to [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] to defeat the government. In the resounding loss at the [[1929 Australian federal election|subsequent election]] the prime minister lost his own seat, an event unprecedented in Australia and one that would not occur again until [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]].\n\nAlthough he returned to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the [[Lyons Government]] was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the [[League of Nations]], emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the [[developing world]]. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the [[House of Lords]], as well as the first Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]]. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Paterson, Laing and Bruce.jpg|thumb|left|The firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, 1900. John Bruce sits at the centre.]]\nStanley Melbourne Bruce was born on 15 April 1883 in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], a suburb of Melbourne, and was the youngest of five children.{{sfn|Carroll|p=105}} He disliked his given name and throughout his life preferred to be known by his initials \"S.M.\", even among close friends. His wife called him simply \"S\".{{sfn|Cumpston|p=1}}\n\nBruce's father, [[John Munro Bruce]], was born to Scottish parents in [[County Leitrim]], Ireland, and had emigrated to Australia in 1858 at the age of 18. His mother, Mary Ann Henderson, was Irish and had married her cousin John after emigrating to Australia in 1872 at the age of 24.{{sfn|Lee|pp=1\u20132}}  John Bruce became a talented businessman with \"a flair for buying and selling\",{{sfn|Lee|p=2}} which would secure him a partnership in an established Melbourne importing firm that in 1868 became known as Paterson, Laing and Bruce.{{sfn|Edwards|p=8}} As his wealth grew, John Bruce became influential in colonial Victoria's social and political life. An avid golfer, he was one of the founders of the [[Royal Melbourne Golf Club]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=9\u201310}} He was prominent in the [[Protectionist Party|liberal protectionist]] political movement within the state and an early supporter of future prime minister [[Alfred Deakin]]. John Bruce's success ensured that Stanley Bruce, his sister Mary and his brothers Ernest, William and Robert were born into affluence. Shortly after Stanley Bruce's birth the family relocated to the stately Wombalano manor, built by John Bruce, in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=8\u20139}} However, John Bruce was an aloof and remote figure in the lives of his children, as his son Stanley later recounted.{{sfn|Lee|p=3}} Despite their family's [[Presbyterian]] back-ground, Stanley Bruce was sent to Melbourne Church of England Grammar School (now [[Melbourne Grammar School]]) and subsequently Stanley Bruce would come to identify principally as [[Anglican]].{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}} Bruce was an average student but extremely active in the sporting life of the school and captain of its [[Australian rules football|football]] team, and then of the school itself in 1901. Today, the school honours him with his own house, Bruce House, the colours of which are scarlet and white. The house's mascot is a lion, symbolising Bruce's bravery.<ref>mgs.vic.edu.au</ref>{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s hit the Bruce family fortunes hard. John Bruce lost much of his fortune in the Victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in the importing business in 1897.{{sfn|Stirling|p=162}} The family suffered a great deal more tragedy over the coming decades. Stanley's brother William committed suicide in 1899, shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness.{{sfn|Lee|p=4}} Just two years later John Bruce took his own life during a business trip to Paris; he had suffered from depression as a result of the great pressures on his business and finances.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}  His sister Mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908, and his mother died too in 1912. Finally, Bruce's beloved brother Ernest shot himself in 1919, suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in World War I.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of S.M. Bruce.png|left|upright|thumb|Bruce in the 1910s]]\nIn the aftermath of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1902.{{sfn|Lee|p=6}} He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1904.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard D. Burnell|title=One Hundred and Fifty Years of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race: An Official History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_2BAAAAMAAJ&q|year=1979|publisher=Precision Press|location=Marlow, UK|page=104|isbn=978-0-9500638-7-4}}</ref> Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]) and write on the subject for much of his life.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=15\u201328}} Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered.{{sfn|Lee|pp=6\u20137}} During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a [[barrister]] in the London with the firm of [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=16\u201317}} His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and [[Colombia]] in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}}\n\nBy 1912 Bruce was a businessman and a successful barrister, and it was in this year [[Ethel Bruce|Ethel Dunlop Anderson]] traveled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatter]] family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}} Theirs was a close-knit relationship{{spaced ndash}} they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion.{{sfn|Lee|pp=8\u20139}} But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, and the fact that the Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest's daughter, Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life and was to become the main beneficiary of his Will but Bruce \"was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Military service==\n[[File:Sbruce.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Captain Bruce of the Royal Fusiliers during World War I]]\nBruce returned briefly to Australia in 1914, swapping positions within the company with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but all three of them would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and for many of them, long periods of residency in) Great Britain.{{sfn|Lee|p=9}} Bruce enlisted and received a commission as [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 7 February 1915<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=19 February 1915|issue=29079|page=1823|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29079/supplements/1823|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>  and was attached to the [[Royal Fusiliers|2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]] in Egypt, which was then assigned to the [[British 29th Division]]. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] (MEF).{{sfn|Lee|p=10}} [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] had devised a strategy of capturing the [[Dardanelles]] from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However [[Allies of World War I|allied naval forces]] were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This was the beginning of the now infamous [[Gallipoli Campaign]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Moorehead|title=Gallipoli|year=2002|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Sydney|isbn=0-06-093708-4|pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\nBruce's regiment landed at [[Cape Helles]] in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished himself in the [[Trench warfare|construction of trenches]] and as an able commander.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=31\u201332}} His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose.{{sfn|Stirling|p=485}} He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at [[Suvla Bay]], where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his service during these months,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=1 February 1916|issue=29460|page=1337|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29460/supplements/1337|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=22 February 1916|issue=29486|page=2068|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29486/supplements/2068|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> and rose to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 5 August.{{sfn|Lee|p=12}} He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}}\n\nAlthough it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business.{{sfn|Edwards|p=33}} The [[War Office]] refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]],{{sfn|Carroll|p=106}} who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Third Supplement|issue=30123|page=5710|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/30123/supplement/5710|journal=London Gazette |date=9 June 1917}}</ref>\n\nHaving served with many of his countrymen he returned to Australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in the country of his birth.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}} But having borne witness to the catastrophic loss of life in the Gallipoli Campaign and the death of most of his army comrades, as well as having suffered through the loss of most of his family, at age 34 Bruce was imbued with \"a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Early years in politics==\n\nBruce's popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} As Sir [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]] had recently resigned from parliament to become [[Chief Justice of Victoria]], there was to be [[1918 Flinders by-election|a by-election]] for his seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for.{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} The Nationalist [[preselection]] for the seat attracted many candidates, and [[Edward Fancourt Mitchell|Sir Edward Mitchell]], one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]] prevented the newly formed [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from [[Dandenong]] out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flinders By-Election: Declaration of Poll|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1660514|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=20 May 1918}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking to the delegates in Dandenong, Bruce summed up his political philosophy:\n<blockquote>A plain soldier and business man. I am no politician, nor have I any desire to be one. In the course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by the vast majority of the population.{{sfn|Lee|p=18}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and Billy Hughes, 1925.png|right|thumb|Billy Hughes, [[Herbert Pratten]] and Stanley Bruce]]\nBruce's early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the [[Commonwealth Line]]. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies.{{sfn|Sawer|p=156}} The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable. However its post-war existence was extensively criticised by Bruce as inappropriate and inefficient, and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed.{{sfn|Fitzhardinge|pp=500\u2013501}} Bruce also distinguished himself as one of Australia's two representatives to the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 in [[Geneva]], at which he passionately advocated for [[disarmament]] and greater international cooperation, despite his general scepticism with regards to the League's mission and potential for success.{{sfn|Lee|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Treasurer, 1921\u20131923===\nReturning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Minister for Trade and Customs]]. Bruce was not interested{{spaced ndash}} he was the head of one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious [[conflict of interest]] with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to [[Walter Massy-Greene]]. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=57\u201358}} Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=59\u201360}} Influential party figures such as Senator [[George Pearce]] and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=George Foster |title=Carpenter to Cabinet: Thirty-Seven Years of Parliament. |year=1951 |publisher=Hutchinson & Company Limited |location=London, UK |page=156}}</ref>\n\nBruce and Hughes clashed in both style and ideology. Bruce found Hughes' management of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=63\u201365}} But he served as a strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas.{{sfn|Treasury of Australia}} His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mr. Bruce and his Critics |author= |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1858670 |newspaper=The Argus |date=30 November 1922|page=8}}</ref> The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the [[1922 Australian federal election|1922 elections]] in December.{{sfn|Edwards|p=67}} Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=69\u201371}}\n\n==Prime Minister, 1923\u20131929==\n[[File:Nla1ndBruceMinistry.jpg|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Bruce's newly assembled ministry, 1923]]\nThe Nationalists lost eleven seats and their majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1922 Australian federal election|election of 1922]]. Only three of these seats were picked up by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] though, and Labor still lacked the numbers to form government in their own right. Rather, a breakaway anti-Hughes [[Liberal Party (1922)|Liberal Party]] took five government seats, while the Country Party increased their number to 14 and now held the balance of power.{{sfn|Barber|p=27}} The only politically realistic option for the Nationalists to stay in office was to come to an agreement with the Country Party.

New industrial action led by the [[Maritime Union of Australia|Waterside Workers Federation]] broke out. In Melbourne these turned to riots, claiming casualties and at least one fatality. Reviving the \"red scare\" pitch for the [[1928 Australian federal election|1928 election]] campaign, Bruce pushed the ''[[Transport Workers Act 1928|Transport Workers Act]]'' through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations.{{sfn|Sawer|p=265}} All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or \"dog collars\" as they were derisively known, to work.{{sfn|Lee|p=79}} The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among organised labour.\n\nAt the 1928 election Bruce's government was returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine{{spaced ndash}} a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections.{{sfn|Barber|p=29}}{{sfn|Murray|p=119}} Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out.

Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government failed to produce a settlement.

Bruce assumed the presidency of the League of Nations Council in 1936 at the height of the crisis and after the failure of the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact]] between France, Italy and Britain, but further attempts to forestall the invasion failed. He presided as League Council President during the [[Rhineland Crisis]], although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed. Although this did not shake his conviction in the potential of the League, he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=128\u2013129}} He was nominated by Turkey to chair the 1936 [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits|Montreux Conference]], which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through the [[Turkish Straits]]{{spaced ndash}} an issue of particular relevance to Bruce as a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=129\u2013130}} Despite the turmoil of his presidency, the League historian F.P.

Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=122\u2013123}} In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential.

He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|partition of Czechoslovakia]] by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's [[appeasement]] policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clavin|first=Patricia|authorlink=Patricia Clavin|title=Securing the World Economy: The Reinvention of the League of Nations, 1920\u20131946|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0-19-957793-5|pages=233\u2013251}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\nIn the events leading up to World War II, Bruce and Lyons had been supporters of the British under Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement exercised with regards to the [[reoccupation of the Rhineland]], the [[Anschluss]] and the [[Munich Crisis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bird|first=David|title=The 'Tame Tasmanian': Appeasement and Rearmament in Australia, 1932\u20131939|year=1993|publisher=A.W.Martin|isbn=1-74097-157-4|location=Melbourne|pages=262\u2013268}}</ref> Even during the \"[[phoney war]]\", Bruce continued to advocate the implementation of a more durable international system to enforce peace through mutual disarmament, the expansion of transnational trade, and global organizations capable of addressing the pressing social and economic questions that he felt were the recurrent causes of international conflict.{{sfn|Lee|p=138}} He had become a close confidant of senior Conservative Party figures [[Anthony Eden]] and Neville Chamberlain in this period,{{sfn|Stirling|p=60}} and was strident in advancing the opinion of Australia (and the dominions more broadly) that negotiation and compromise with Nazi Germany was preferable to war.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=157\u2013167}} Bruce actively participated in the negotiations for the [[Munich Agreement]]. When Lyons died in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey personally appealed for Bruce to return to Australia and take over once more as prime minister at the head of the UAP. Bruce demurred, however, and made it the condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and lead an all-party [[unity government]]. Such conditions were politically impossible to meet, and Robert Menzies [[1939 United Australia Party leadership election|was elected as the new leader of the UAP]].{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and the Troops.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|High Commissioner Bruce drinking tea with Australian troops in London during World War II]]\n[[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|Britain's declaration of war]] against Germany on 3 September 1939 was followed within hours by Australia's Prime Minister Menzies stating that because of Britain's declaration Australia too was now at war with Germany.

He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure.{{sfn|P.G. Edwards|p = 52}} With the fear of [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|Japanese invasion]] mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill on a number of occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 275\u2013285}} Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Joe|title=The Commonwealth Office, 1925\u201368|year=1978|publisher=Heinemann|location=London, UK|isbn=0-435-32355-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217 217]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217}}</ref> Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 220}} In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers [[Clement Attlee]] and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from [[John Curtin]] and the other dominion prime ministers.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013176}}\n\n==Food and Agriculture Organization, 1946\u20131951==\n[[File:Pius XIII and the World Food Council 1950.JPG|thumb|[[Pope Pius XII]] with chairman Bruce and members of the World Food Council in Rome, 1950]]\nBy the war's end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's successor [[Ben Chifley]] that he would not object to being replaced in the position.{{sfn|Lee|p=162}} In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers{{spaced ndash}} the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]]{{spaced ndash}} that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters.{{sfn|Lee|pp=166\u2013168}} Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=280\u2013283}} The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that [[Franklin Roosevelt]] convened in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nAs the war in Europe drew to a close and the [[United Nations Charter]] was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being considered to become the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], with American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and [[British Foreign Minister]] Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions.{{sfn|Hasluck|p=246}} In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a \"world food board\" to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a [[Food bank|world food reserve]] and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, [[International aid|international development aid]], commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=January 1947 |title=PR.54}}</ref> The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.{{sfn|Lee|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nUndeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute [[fertiliser]] and [[agricultural machinery]], as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 252}} More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=13\u201324 June 1949 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=5\u201317 April 1948 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-war population boom]].<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=12\u201315 November 1951 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and [[Cold War]] conflicts multiplied.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 253}} Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 422\u2013423}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne.svg|thumb|Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne ''Or, a saltire gules cantoned between four mullets sable, on a chief of the second a pale argent charged with a saltire of the third''<ref>{{cite book |title=Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage |date=1963 |publisher=Kelly's Directories |page=199 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nBruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia. He had been Chairman of the Finance Corporation of Industry since 1946 and continued in the role until 1957, providing finance to projects of benefit to the British national economy. Bruce helped establish the program in Australia in 1954 and on a Commonwealth basis in 1956.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=253\u2013256}} He became the first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the newly established [[Australian National University]] in 1952, and took an active interest in its development, especially as a research centre for the study of Asia and the Pacific.{{sfn|Lee|pp=180\u2013184}} Bruce concluded that Australia's position in the world had changed as a result of World War II, commenting:\n<blockquote>[Australia] has become a bridgehead between East and West.

Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=259\u2013262}} He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of [[Leander Club]], while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=448\u2013452}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Stanley Bruce bust.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Stanley Bruce by sculptor Wallace Anderson located in the [[Prime Ministers Avenue]] in the [[Ballarat Botanical Gardens]] in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]]]\nBruce remained active and in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of [[deafness]], but the death of his wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him.

In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world's poorest.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=458\u2013461}}\n\nBruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda{{spaced ndash}} as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition for these efforts.{{sfn|Henderson|p=352}} Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas.

August 1967) was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by time in office|8th]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]], in office from 1923 to 1929. He made wide-ranging reforms and mounted a comprehensive nation-building program in government, but his controversial handling of industrial relations led to a dramatic [[1929 Australian federal election|defeat at the polls in 1929]]. Bruce later pursued a long and influential diplomatic career as [[List of High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] (1933\u20131945) and chairman of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (1946\u20131951).\n\nBorn into a briefly wealthy [[Melbourne]] family, Bruce studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] and spent his early life tending to the importing and exporting business of his late father. He served on the front lines of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesperson for government recruitment efforts. He gained the attention of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], who encouraged a political career. He was elected to [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]] in 1918, becoming [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] in 1921 and then prime minister in 1923, at the head of a coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]].\n\nIn office Bruce pursued an energetic and diverse agenda. He comprehensively overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital city of [[Canberra]]. He implemented various reforms to the [[Federalism in Australia|Australian federal system]] to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth, and helped develop the forerunners of the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the [[CSIRO]]. Bruce's \"men, money and markets\" scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia's population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the [[British Empire]]. However, his endeavours to overhaul Australia's industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with the labour movement, and his radical proposal to abolish [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration|Commonwealth arbitration]] in 1929 prompted members of his own party to [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] to defeat the government. In the resounding loss at the [[1929 Australian federal election|subsequent election]] the prime minister lost his own seat, an event unprecedented in Australia and one that would not occur again until [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]].\n\nAlthough he returned to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the [[Lyons Government]] was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the [[League of Nations]], emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the [[developing world]]. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the [[House of Lords]], as well as the first Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]]. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Paterson, Laing and Bruce.jpg|thumb|left|The firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, 1900. John Bruce sits at the centre.]]\nStanley Melbourne Bruce was born on 15 April 1883 in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], a suburb of Melbourne, and was the youngest of five children.{{sfn|Carroll|p=105}} He disliked his given name and throughout his life preferred to be known by his initials \"S.M.\", even among close friends. His wife called him simply \"S\".{{sfn|Cumpston|p=1}}\n\nBruce's father, [[John Munro Bruce]], was born to Scottish parents in [[County Leitrim]], Ireland, and had emigrated to Australia in 1858 at the age of 18. His mother, Mary Ann Henderson, was Irish and had married her cousin John after emigrating to Australia in 1872 at the age of 24.{{sfn|Lee|pp=1\u20132}}  John Bruce became a talented businessman with \"a flair for buying and selling\",{{sfn|Lee|p=2}} which would secure him a partnership in an established Melbourne importing firm that in 1868 became known as Paterson, Laing and Bruce.{{sfn|Edwards|p=8}} As his wealth grew, John Bruce became influential in colonial Victoria's social and political life. An avid golfer, he was one of the founders of the [[Royal Melbourne Golf Club]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=9\u201310}} He was prominent in the [[Protectionist Party|liberal protectionist]] political movement within the state and an early supporter of future prime minister [[Alfred Deakin]]. John Bruce's success ensured that Stanley Bruce, his sister Mary and his brothers Ernest, William and Robert were born into affluence. Shortly after Stanley Bruce's birth the family relocated to the stately Wombalano manor, built by John Bruce, in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=8\u20139}} However, John Bruce was an aloof and remote figure in the lives of his children, as his son Stanley later recounted.{{sfn|Lee|p=3}} Despite their family's [[Presbyterian]] back-ground, Stanley Bruce was sent to Melbourne Church of England Grammar School (now [[Melbourne Grammar School]]) and subsequently Stanley Bruce would come to identify principally as [[Anglican]].{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}} Bruce was an average student but extremely active in the sporting life of the school and captain of its [[Australian rules football|football]] team, and then of the school itself in 1901. Today, the school honours him with his own house, Bruce House, the colours of which are scarlet and white. The house's mascot is a lion, symbolising Bruce's bravery.<ref>mgs.vic.edu.au</ref>{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s hit the Bruce family fortunes hard. John Bruce lost much of his fortune in the Victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in the importing business in 1897.{{sfn|Stirling|p=162}} The family suffered a great deal more tragedy over the coming decades. Stanley's brother William committed suicide in 1899, shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness.{{sfn|Lee|p=4}} Just two years later John Bruce took his own life during a business trip to Paris; he had suffered from depression as a result of the great pressures on his business and finances.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}  His sister Mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908, and his mother died too in 1912. Finally, Bruce's beloved brother Ernest shot himself in 1919, suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in World War I.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of S.M. Bruce.png|left|upright|thumb|Bruce in the 1910s]]\nIn the aftermath of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1902.{{sfn|Lee|p=6}} He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1904.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard D. Burnell|title=One Hundred and Fifty Years of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race: An Official History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_2BAAAAMAAJ&q|year=1979|publisher=Precision Press|location=Marlow, UK|page=104|isbn=978-0-9500638-7-4}}</ref> Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]) and write on the subject for much of his life.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=15\u201328}} Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered.{{sfn|Lee|pp=6\u20137}} During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a [[barrister]] in the London with the firm of [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=16\u201317}} His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and [[Colombia]] in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}}\n\nBy 1912 Bruce was a businessman and a successful barrister, and it was in this year [[Ethel Bruce|Ethel Dunlop Anderson]] traveled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatter]] family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}} Theirs was a close-knit relationship{{spaced ndash}} they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion.{{sfn|Lee|pp=8\u20139}} But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, and the fact that the Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest's daughter, Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life and was to become the main beneficiary of his Will but Bruce \"was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Military service==\n[[File:Sbruce.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Captain Bruce of the Royal Fusiliers during World War I]]\nBruce returned briefly to Australia in 1914, swapping positions within the company with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but all three of them would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and for many of them, long periods of residency in) Great Britain.{{sfn|Lee|p=9}} Bruce enlisted and received a commission as [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 7 February 1915<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=19 February 1915|issue=29079|page=1823|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29079/supplements/1823|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>  and was attached to the [[Royal Fusiliers|2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]] in Egypt, which was then assigned to the [[British 29th Division]]. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] (MEF).{{sfn|Lee|p=10}} [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] had devised a strategy of capturing the [[Dardanelles]] from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However [[Allies of World War I|allied naval forces]] were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This was the beginning of the now infamous [[Gallipoli Campaign]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Moorehead|title=Gallipoli|year=2002|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Sydney|isbn=0-06-093708-4|pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\nBruce's regiment landed at [[Cape Helles]] in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished himself in the [[Trench warfare|construction of trenches]] and as an able commander.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=31\u201332}} His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose.{{sfn|Stirling|p=485}} He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at [[Suvla Bay]], where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his service during these months,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=1 February 1916|issue=29460|page=1337|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29460/supplements/1337|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=22 February 1916|issue=29486|page=2068|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29486/supplements/2068|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> and rose to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 5 August.{{sfn|Lee|p=12}} He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}}\n\nAlthough it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business.{{sfn|Edwards|p=33}} The [[War Office]] refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]],{{sfn|Carroll|p=106}} who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Third Supplement|issue=30123|page=5710|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/30123/supplement/5710|journal=London Gazette |date=9 June 1917}}</ref>\n\nHaving served with many of his countrymen he returned to Australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in the country of his birth.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}} But having borne witness to the catastrophic loss of life in the Gallipoli Campaign and the death of most of his army comrades, as well as having suffered through the loss of most of his family, at age 34 Bruce was imbued with \"a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Early years in politics==\n\nBruce's popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} As Sir [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]] had recently resigned from parliament to become [[Chief Justice of Victoria]], there was to be [[1918 Flinders by-election|a by-election]] for his seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for.{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} The Nationalist [[preselection]] for the seat attracted many candidates, and [[Edward Fancourt Mitchell|Sir Edward Mitchell]], one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]] prevented the newly formed [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from [[Dandenong]] out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flinders By-Election: Declaration of Poll|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1660514|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=20 May 1918}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking to the delegates in Dandenong, Bruce summed up his political philosophy:\n<blockquote>A plain soldier and business man. I am no politician, nor have I any desire to be one. In the course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by the vast majority of the population.{{sfn|Lee|p=18}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and Billy Hughes, 1925.png|right|thumb|Billy Hughes, [[Herbert Pratten]] and Stanley Bruce]]\nBruce's early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the [[Commonwealth Line]]. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies.{{sfn|Sawer|p=156}} The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable.

Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government failed to produce a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at [[Pelaw Main, New South Wales|Pelaw Main]] and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner|first=J.W.|title=Brown, John (1850\u20131930)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brown-john-5388|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref> Attorney-General [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate an end to the dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.{{sfn|Lee|pp=83\u201385}}\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and John Latham.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce with [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], his Attorney-General and eventual successor as leader of the Nationalist Party]]\nBruce and the conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that \"economic deterioration [was] the product, rather than the possible cause, of worsening industrial relations.\"{{sfn|Plowman|p=54}} Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or the federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration.{{sfn|Lee|p=85}} The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration.

He opposed action against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] following the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] in 1933, concerned as to [[Australia\u2013Japan relations|Australia's trading relationship with Japan]] and the potential future threat it posed to peace in the Pacific.{{sfn|Hudson|pp=67\u201370}}  He also attempted to steer the League away from sanctioning member nations, believing it yet lacked the military or economic sway to do so effectively and feared the breakdown of the League{{spaced ndash}} a prospect that loomed after [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and Japan departed the body in 1933.{{sfn|Hudson|pp=74\u201377}} During the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], Bruce again counselled against partial sanctions, believing them the worst option as they would not stop the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Ethiopian invasion]] and yet would alienate Italy{{spaced ndash}} then a [[Stresa Front|potential ally]] against a rearming Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Hudson|pp=74\u201377}} He further argued for much greater rearmament efforts in the United Kingdom and France to provide greater military capacity to enforce future decisions by the League. Bruce assumed the presidency of the League of Nations Council in 1936 at the height of the crisis and after the failure of the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact]] between France, Italy and Britain, but further attempts to forestall the invasion failed. He presided as League Council President during the [[Rhineland Crisis]], although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed. Although this did not shake his conviction in the potential of the League, he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=128\u2013129}} He was nominated by Turkey to chair the 1936 [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits|Montreux Conference]], which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through the [[Turkish Straits]]{{spaced ndash}} an issue of particular relevance to Bruce as a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=129\u2013130}} Despite the turmoil of his presidency, the League historian F.P. Walters would later describe Bruce as \"the best, perhaps, of the many first-rate chairmen who presided over the Council, Conferences, or Committees of the League\".<ref>F.P. Walters, ''A History of the League of Nations'', 1952, 833 pages, freely available on the site of the United Nations Office in Geneva [https://libraryresources.unog.ch/c.php?g=462663&p=3163196 online]</ref>\n\nBy 1937 Bruce's attention had shifted to social and economic cooperation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=129\u2013130}} He had taken a leading role in promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic cooperation through the League of Nations, working intensively with [[Frank McDougall]] and [[John Boyd Orr]] throughout the decade.{{sfn|Lee|pp=112\u2013113}} In 1937 he presented a plan of \"economic appeasement\", which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=122\u2013123}} In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the [[Marshall Plan]], Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Speech to the Second Committee of the League of Nations |author=Bruce, Stanley |date=19 September 1935 |location=Geneva}}</ref> [[File:Bruce chairing the Montreaux Conference.jpg|thumb|Bruce as Chairman of the Montreux Conference, 1938]]\n\n<blockquote>I feel very strongly that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position&nbsp;... it is vital for the prestige and future wellbeing of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=150}}</blockquote>\n\nThe plan was supported by Secretary-General [[Joseph Louis Anne Avenol]], who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan.{{sfn|Stirling|p=131}}{{sfn|Hudson|pp=172\u2013173}} Critically, new British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into the development of the League, and the body began to lose its political impetus as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|partition of Czechoslovakia]] by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's [[appeasement]] policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clavin|first=Patricia|authorlink=Patricia Clavin|title=Securing the World Economy: The Reinvention of the League of Nations, 1920\u20131946|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0-19-957793-5|pages=233\u2013251}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\nIn the events leading up to World War II, Bruce and Lyons had been supporters of the British under Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement exercised with regards to the [[reoccupation of the Rhineland]], the [[Anschluss]] and the [[Munich Crisis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bird|first=David|title=The 'Tame Tasmanian': Appeasement and Rearmament in Australia, 1932\u20131939|year=1993|publisher=A.W.Martin|isbn=1-74097-157-4|location=Melbourne|pages=262\u2013268}}</ref> Even during the \"[[phoney war]]\", Bruce continued to advocate the implementation of a more durable international system to enforce peace through mutual disarmament, the expansion of transnational trade, and global organizations capable of addressing the pressing social and economic questions that he felt were the recurrent causes of international conflict.{{sfn|Lee|p=138}} He had become a close confidant of senior Conservative Party figures [[Anthony Eden]] and Neville Chamberlain in this period,{{sfn|Stirling|p=60}} and was strident in advancing the opinion of Australia (and the dominions more broadly) that negotiation and compromise with Nazi Germany was preferable to war.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=157\u2013167}} Bruce actively participated in the negotiations for the [[Munich Agreement]]. When Lyons died in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey personally appealed for Bruce to return to Australia and take over once more as prime minister at the head of the UAP. Bruce demurred, however, and made it the condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and lead an all-party [[unity government]]. Such conditions were politically impossible to meet, and Robert Menzies [[1939 United Australia Party leadership election|was elected as the new leader of the UAP]].{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and the Troops.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|High Commissioner Bruce drinking tea with Australian troops in London during World War II]]\n[[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|Britain's declaration of war]] against Germany on 3 September 1939 was followed within hours by Australia's Prime Minister Menzies stating that because of Britain's declaration Australia too was now at war with Germany. Winston Churchill's accession as British Prime Minister in May 1940 brought Bruce into frequent conflict with the British government. Churchill saw the dominions as still semi-dependent colonies who were at London's command<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Andrew|title=Empire Lost: Britain, the dominions and the Second World War|year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=1-84725-244-3|location=London, UK|page=41}}</ref> whereas Bruce saw the Empire as a kind of international partnership and the dominions as rightful parties to the decision-making process.{{sfn|Lee|p=137}} Britain's preoccupation with the European theatre alarmed Australian politicians, given the tenuous position of Far Eastern possessions and the looming possibility of Japanese invasion.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=180\u2013184}} After [[Pacific War|a string of defeats in the Far East]], particularly the [[Fall of Singapore]], the Australian government was finally successful in having Bruce accredited to the [[British War Cabinet]] and [[Pacific War Council]] as an Australian (and dominion) representative.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=196\u2013198}} \nHowever, Bruce soon became embroiled in the disputes over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and his lack of consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure.{{sfn|P.G. Edwards|p = 52}} With the fear of [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|Japanese invasion]] mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill on a number of occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 275\u2013285}} Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Joe|title=The Commonwealth Office, 1925\u201368|year=1978|publisher=Heinemann|location=London, UK|isbn=0-435-32355-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217 217]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217}}</ref> Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 220}} In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers [[Clement Attlee]] and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from [[John Curtin]] and the other dominion prime ministers.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013176}}\n\n==Food and Agriculture Organization, 1946\u20131951==\n[[File:Pius XIII and the World Food Council 1950.JPG|thumb|[[Pope Pius XII]] with chairman Bruce and members of the World Food Council in Rome, 1950]]\nBy the war's end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's successor [[Ben Chifley]] that he would not object to being replaced in the position.{{sfn|Lee|p=162}} In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers{{spaced ndash}} the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]]{{spaced ndash}} that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters.{{sfn|Lee|pp=166\u2013168}} Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=280\u2013283}} The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that [[Franklin Roosevelt]] convened in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nAs the war in Europe drew to a close and the [[United Nations Charter]] was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being considered to become the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], with American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and [[British Foreign Minister]] Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions.{{sfn|Hasluck|p=246}} In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a \"world food board\" to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a [[Food bank|world food reserve]] and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, [[International aid|international development aid]], commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=January 1947 |title=PR.54}}</ref> The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.{{sfn|Lee|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nUndeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute [[fertiliser]] and [[agricultural machinery]], as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 252}} More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=13\u201324 June 1949 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=5\u201317 April 1948 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-war population boom]].<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=12\u201315 November 1951 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and [[Cold War]] conflicts multiplied.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 253}} Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 422\u2013423}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne.svg|thumb|Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne ''Or, a saltire gules cantoned between four mullets sable, on a chief of the second a pale argent charged with a saltire of the third''<ref>{{cite book |title=Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage |date=1963 |publisher=Kelly's Directories |page=199 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nBruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia. He had been Chairman of the Finance Corporation of Industry since 1946 and continued in the role until 1957, providing finance to projects of benefit to the British national economy. Bruce helped establish the program in Australia in 1954 and on a Commonwealth basis in 1956.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=253\u2013256}} He became the first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the newly established [[Australian National University]] in 1952, and took an active interest in its development, especially as a research centre for the study of Asia and the Pacific.{{sfn|Lee|pp=180\u2013184}} Bruce concluded that Australia's position in the world had changed as a result of World War II, commenting:\n<blockquote>[Australia] has become a bridgehead between East and West.

Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=259\u2013262}} He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of [[Leander Club]], while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=448\u2013452}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Stanley Bruce bust.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Stanley Bruce by sculptor Wallace Anderson located in the [[Prime Ministers Avenue]] in the [[Ballarat Botanical Gardens]] in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]]]\nBruce remained active and in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of [[deafness]], but the death of his wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him.

In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world's poorest.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=458\u2013461}}\n\nBruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda{{spaced ndash}} as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition for these efforts.{{sfn|Henderson|p=352}} Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas.
