As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Palermo|first=Giulia|last2=Ricci|first2=Clarisse G.|last3=McCammon|first3=J. Andrew|date=April 2019|title=The invisible dance of CRISPR-Cas9.

These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognize the foreign insert and cleaves it.<ref name=\":23\" /> This discovery was very crucial because now the Cas protein can be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process.\n\nBy using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist.<ref name=\":32\"/> However, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging.\n\n=== Back breeding ===\nBack breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|title=Pathways to de\u2010extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996\u20131002|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|year=2017|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d9fdfbc55d587550d295dc38e4f9d1423922d6f|doi-access=free}}</ref> This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.<ref name=\":122\"/> Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the species still being in the population in any frequency.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Iterative evolution===\nA natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the [[white-throated rail]]. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species.

While it was abundant up to the [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]], over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park|Ordesa National Park]]. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having been crushed by a fallen tree. In 2003, scientists used the tissue sample to attempt to clone Celia and resurrect the extinct subspecies. Despite having successfully transferred nuclei from her cells into [[domestic goat]] egg cells and impregnating 208 female goats, only one came to term. The baby ibex that was born had a lung defect, and lived for only 7 minutes before suffocating from being incapable of breathing oxygen. Nevertheless, her birth was seen as a triumph and has been considered to have been the first de-extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2009-02-10}}</ref> In late 2013, scientists announced that they would again attempt to recreate the Pyrenean ibex. A problem to be faced, in addition to the many challenges of reproduction of a mammal by cloning, is that only females can be produced by cloning the female individual Celia, and no males exist for those females to reproduce with. This could potentially be addressed by breeding female clones with the closely related [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]], and gradually creating a hybrid animal that will eventually bear more resemblance to the Pyrenean ibex than the Southeastern Spanish ibex.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25052233|title=BBC News \u2013 Fresh effort to clone extinct animal|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2013-11-22|last1=Rincon|first1=Paul}}</ref>\n[[File:Aurochs1.png|thumb|The Auroch size compared to the size of a human.]]\n\n=== Aurochs ===\nThe [[aurochs]] was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the [[Pleistocene]], but only the European aurochs (''[[Aurochs|Bos primigenius primigenius]]'') survived into historic times.<ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0|title=Bos primigenius|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as [[Lascaux cave|Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet cave|Chauvet]] cave in France,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|title=BBC Nature \u2013 Cattle and aurochs videos, news and facts|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> and was still widespread during the [[Roman era]].

The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.nyls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&=&context=fac_other_pubs&=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C10%2526q%253Dde%252Bextinction%2526oq%253Ddeext#search=%22de%20extinction%22|title=What If Extinction Is Not Forever?|last=Sherkow|first=Jacob|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> There are both pros and cons to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues.\n\n==Methods==\n===Cloning===\n[[File:Pyrenean ibex Cloning.svg|thumb|left|Pictured above is the process used to clone the [[Pyrenean ibex]] in 2003. The tissue culture was taken from the last living, female Pyrenean ibex named Celia. The egg was taken from a [[goat]] (''Capra hircus'') and the nuclei removed to ensure the offspring was purely Pyrenean ibex. The egg was implanted into a surrogate goat mother for development.]]\n\n[[Cloning]] is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species' nearest living relative.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|date=2016-08-09|title=Pathways to de-extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996\u20131002|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|issn=0269-8463|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d9fdfbc55d587550d295dc38e4f9d1423922d6f|doi-access=free}}</ref> The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species\u2019 nearest living relative.

Dolly was born in the mid 1990s and lived a normal life until she experienced health complications that led to her death.<ref name=\":5\" /> Other animal species known to have been cloned include dogs, pigs, and horses.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Genome editing ===\nGenome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Palermo|first=Giulia|last2=Ricci|first2=Clarisse G.|last3=McCammon|first3=J. Andrew|date=April 2019|title=The invisible dance of CRISPR-Cas9.

These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within the chromosome, it gets transcribed into RNA. Once this occurs, the Cas9 binds to the RNA. Cas9 can recognize the foreign insert and cleaves it.<ref name=\":23\" /> This discovery was very crucial because now the Cas protein can be viewed as a scissor in the genome editing process.\n\nBy using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because it is possible to sequence and assemble the genome of extinct organisms from highly degraded tissues, this technique enables scientists to pursue de-extinction in a wider array of species, including those for which no well-preserved remains exist.<ref name=\":32\"/> However, the more degraded and old the tissue from the extinct species is, the more fragmented the resulting DNA will be, making genome assembly more challenging.\n\n=== Back breeding ===\nBack breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|title=Pathways to de\u2010extinction: how close can we get to resurrection of an extinct species?|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=31|issue=5|pages=996\u20131002|last=Shapiro|first=Beth|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12705|year=2017|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d9fdfbc55d587550d295dc38e4f9d1423922d6f|doi-access=free}}</ref> This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.<ref name=\":122\"/> Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the species still being in the population in any frequency.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Iterative evolution===\nA natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the [[white-throated rail]]. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels dropped, allowing the bird to evolve once again as a flightless species on the island of [[Aldabra]], where it is found to the present day.<ref name=\"The bird that came back from the dead2\">[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/uop-tbt050919.php The bird that came back from the dead]</ref><ref name=\"Extinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists find2\">[https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/africa/white-throated-rail-extinction-scli-intl-scn/index.html Extinct species of bird came back from the dead, scientists find]</ref><ref name=\"This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again2\">[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb9bpm/this-bird-went-extinct-and-then-evolved-into-existence-again This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again]</ref> Also see [[Elvis taxon]].\n\n== Advantages of de-extinction ==\n\nRevived species may support conservation initiatives by acting as \"[[flagship species]]\" to generate public enthusiasm and funds for conserving entire ecosystems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=Joseph|date=25 March 2015|title=Biodiversity gains from efficient use of private sponsorship for flagship species conservation|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|volume=282|issue=1805|pages=20142693|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2693|pmc=4389608|pmid=25808885}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Whittle|first1=Patrick|display-authors=et al|date=12 Dec 2014|title=Re-creation tourism: de-extinction and its implications for nature-based recreation|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|volume=18|issue=10|pages=908\u2013912|doi=10.1080/13683500.2015.1031727}}</ref>\n\n== Current candidates for de-extinction ==\n[[File:Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) - Mauricio Ant\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|The woolly mammoth (''Mammuthus primigenius'') is a candidate for de-extinction using either cloning or genome editing.]]\n\n=== Woolly mammoth ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\n{{main|Mammoth cloning}}\nThe existence of preserved soft tissue remains and [[DNA]] from [[woolly mammoth]]s has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means.

The first would be to use the cloning process, because even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough DNA intact to guide the production of an embryo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/07/woolly-mammoths-extinction-cloning-genetics/|title=We Could Resurrect the Woolly Mammoth.

The resulting offspring would be an elephant\u2013mammoth hybrid. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth could be produced. However, sperm cells of modern mammals are typically potent for up to 15 years after deep-freezing, which could hinder this method.<ref name=\":42\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/welcome-pleistocene-park-russian-scientists-say-high-chance-cloning-woolly-mammoth/|title=Welcome to Pleistocene Park: Russian scientists say they have a 'high chance' of cloning a woolly mammoth|date=2014-03-14|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> In 2008, a Japanese team found usable DNA in the brains of mice that had been frozen for 16 years.

While it was abundant up to the [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]], over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park|Ordesa National Park]]. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having been crushed by a fallen tree. In 2003, scientists used the tissue sample to attempt to clone Celia and resurrect the extinct subspecies. Despite having successfully transferred nuclei from her cells into [[domestic goat]] egg cells and impregnating 208 female goats, only one came to term. The baby ibex that was born had a lung defect, and lived for only 7 minutes before suffocating from being incapable of breathing oxygen. Nevertheless, her birth was seen as a triumph and has been considered to have been the first de-extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2009-02-10}}</ref> In late 2013, scientists announced that they would again attempt to recreate the Pyrenean ibex. A problem to be faced, in addition to the many challenges of reproduction of a mammal by cloning, is that only females can be produced by cloning the female individual Celia, and no males exist for those females to reproduce with. This could potentially be addressed by breeding female clones with the closely related [[Southeastern Spanish ibex]], and gradually creating a hybrid animal that will eventually bear more resemblance to the Pyrenean ibex than the Southeastern Spanish ibex.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25052233|title=BBC News \u2013 Fresh effort to clone extinct animal|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=2013-11-22|last1=Rincon|first1=Paul}}</ref>\n[[File:Aurochs1.png|thumb|The Auroch size compared to the size of a human.]]\n\n=== Aurochs ===\nThe [[aurochs]] was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the [[Pleistocene]], but only the European aurochs (''[[Aurochs|Bos primigenius primigenius]]'') survived into historic times.<ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0|title=Bos primigenius|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as [[Lascaux cave|Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet cave|Chauvet]] cave in France,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Aurochs#p00fc2yh|title=BBC Nature \u2013 Cattle and aurochs videos, news and facts|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> and was still widespread during the [[Roman era]].

However, evidence discovered in the mid-20th century shows it one of Aeschylus' last plays, definitely after ''[[The Persians]]'' and possibly after ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.<blockquote>\"Those at least who judge by the style, the simplicity of the plot, the paucity of the characters, and the predominance of choric action, will be reluctant to believe that the ''Suppliants'' was composed more than ten years after the ''Prometheus'', ''Persians'', and ''Seven against Thebes''. It may be remarked, though not as an evidence of date, that the play is rather a melodrama than a tragedy. It ends happily, and has no other claim to the latter title than from the pathos excited and sustained by the helpless condition of the fugitive maidens in a foreign land. On the whole, it is rather a good play; and though it has obtained a bad name among scholars on the score of its many corruptions, yet there is a grace and a dignity in the choruses, and a general tenderness, virtue, and artlessness in the characters, that impart a very pleasing tone to the whole composition.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n== Plot ==\n\nThe [[Dana\u00efdes|Danaids]] form the chorus and serve as the protagonists.  They flee a forced marriage to their [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] cousins.  When the Danaids reach [[Argos]], they entreat King [[Pelasgus]] to protect them.  He refuses pending the decision of the Argive people, who decide in the favour of the Danaids.  [[Danaus]] rejoices the outcome, and the Danaids praise the Greek gods.  Almost immediately, a herald of the Egyptians comes to attempt to force the Danaids to return to their cousins for marriage.  Pelasgus arrives, threatens the herald, and urges the Danaids to remain within the walls of Argos.  The play ends with the Danaids retreating into the Argive walls, protected.\n\n[[Frederick Apthorp Paley|Paley's]] version of the plot:\n\n\"The argument is briefly this: Danaus and Aegyptus, sons of Belus, had settled, as the descendants of lo and Epaphus, in the vicinity of Canopus at the mouth of the Nile (''Prometheus'' 870). In consequence of Aegyptus' wish to unite his fifty sons to the fifty daughters of Danaus, the latter fly from Egypt to Argos in order to escape from a union at once incestuous and detested. Arriving with their father at Argos, the land of their ancestress, they appeal to the country for protection on the plea of their descent, to the national gods and heroes, and especially to Zeus as the patron of Suppliants and the author of their race. The king, by name Pelasgus, tardily grants them a refuge with the consent of the people, and in a spirited scene at the conclusion, repels the insolent attempt of the Herald to seize them in the name of the sons of Aegyptus.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Themes ==\n\"The political as well as the theological views of the poet are well set forth in the ''Suppliants''. The decision of the people being supreme over the mere will of the monarch, though uniting in his own person the offices of both king and high priest, and the constant assertion that the real strength of a state is the will of the citizens, form what may be called the Moral of the play, and harmonize with that of the ''Prometheus''.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[George Derwent Thomson|George Thomson]], expanding on D.S. Robertson, interpreted the tetralogy as a defence of the Athenian law requiring widows to marry a brother or cousin of their deceased husband in some circumstances in order to keep his property within the family.<ref name=\"thomson\">{{cite book|author=[[George Derwent Thomson|Thomson, G.]]|title=Aeschylus and Athens|publisher=Lawrence & Wishart|year=1973|edition=4th|pages=285\u2013295}}</ref>  According to this interpretation, the Danaids' predicament of being forced into a marriage with their cousins would not have generated as much sympathy with the initial audience, which was accustomed to such marriages, as it might today.<ref name=\"thomson\" />  This is reflected in the question Pelasgus asks of the Danaids' in ''The Suppliants'' which echoes Athenian law on the subject: \"If the sons of Aigyptos are your masters by the law of the land, claiming to be your next-of-kin, who would wish to oppose them?\"<ref name=\"thomson\" />  Thomson speculates that as ''Oresteia'' ends by validating the contemporary Athenian law regarding trial for murder by the court of [[Areopagus]], the Danaid plays may have ended by validating the contemporary Athenian law regarding marriage of next-of-kin when the husband dies without an heir.<ref name=\"thomson\" />  Thomson further suggests the possibility that as ''Oresteia's'' ending dramatizes the establishment of the court of Areopagus, the Danaid plays may have ended by dramatizing the establishment of the festival of the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival reserved for women which was based on the cult of [[Demeter]] which, according to [[Herodotus]], was brought to Greece from Egypt by the Danaids.<ref name=\"thomson\" />\n\nRidgeway, on the other hand, interpreted the plays as a dramatization of the conflict between [[matrilineal]] and [[patrilineal]] inheritance.<ref name=\"thomson\" />\n\n== Manuscripts ==\n\"The extant MSS.

However, evidence discovered in the mid-20th century shows it one of Aeschylus' last plays, definitely after ''[[The Persians]]'' and possibly after ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.<blockquote>\"Those at least who judge by the style, the simplicity of the plot, the paucity of the characters, and the predominance of choric action, will be reluctant to believe that the ''Suppliants'' was composed more than ten years after the ''Prometheus'', ''Persians'', and ''Seven against Thebes''. It may be remarked, though not as an evidence of date, that the play is rather a melodrama than a tragedy. It ends happily, and has no other claim to the latter title than from the pathos excited and sustained by the helpless condition of the fugitive maidens in a foreign land. On the whole, it is rather a good play; and though it has obtained a bad name among scholars on the score of its many corruptions, yet there is a grace and a dignity in the choruses, and a general tenderness, virtue, and artlessness in the characters, that impart a very pleasing tone to the whole composition.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n== Plot ==\n\nThe [[Dana\u00efdes|Danaids]] form the chorus and serve as the protagonists.  They flee a forced marriage to their [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] cousins.  When the Danaids reach [[Argos]], they entreat King [[Pelasgus]] to protect them.  He refuses pending the decision of the Argive people, who decide in the favour of the Danaids.  [[Danaus]] rejoices the outcome, and the Danaids praise the Greek gods.  Almost immediately, a herald of the Egyptians comes to attempt to force the Danaids to return to their cousins for marriage.  Pelasgus arrives, threatens the herald, and urges the Danaids to remain within the walls of Argos.  The play ends with the Danaids retreating into the Argive walls, protected.\n\n[[Frederick Apthorp Paley|Paley's]] version of the plot:\n\n\"The argument is briefly this: Danaus and Aegyptus, sons of Belus, had settled, as the descendants of lo and Epaphus, in the vicinity of Canopus at the mouth of the Nile (''Prometheus'' 870). In consequence of Aegyptus' wish to unite his fifty sons to the fifty daughters of Danaus, the latter fly from Egypt to Argos in order to escape from a union at once incestuous and detested. Arriving with their father at Argos, the land of their ancestress, they appeal to the country for protection on the plea of their descent, to the national gods and heroes, and especially to Zeus as the patron of Suppliants and the author of their race. The king, by name Pelasgus, tardily grants them a refuge with the consent of the people, and in a spirited scene at the conclusion, repels the insolent attempt of the Herald to seize them in the name of the sons of Aegyptus.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Themes ==\n\"The political as well as the theological views of the poet are well set forth in the ''Suppliants''. The decision of the people being supreme over the mere will of the monarch, though uniting in his own person the offices of both king and high priest, and the constant assertion that the real strength of a state is the will of the citizens, form what may be called the Moral of the play, and harmonize with that of the ''Prometheus''.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[George Derwent Thomson|George Thomson]], expanding on D.S. Robertson, interpreted the tetralogy as a defence of the Athenian law requiring widows to marry a brother or cousin of their deceased husband in some circumstances in order to keep his property within the family.<ref name=\"thomson\">{{cite book|author=[[George Derwent Thomson|Thomson, G.]]|title=Aeschylus and Athens|publisher=Lawrence & Wishart|year=1973|edition=4th|pages=285\u2013295}}</ref>  According to this interpretation, the Danaids' predicament of being forced into a marriage with their cousins would not have generated as much sympathy with the initial audience, which was accustomed to such marriages, as it might today.<ref name=\"thomson\" />  This is reflected in the question Pelasgus asks of the Danaids' in ''The Suppliants'' which echoes Athenian law on the subject: \"If the sons of Aigyptos are your masters by the law of the land, claiming to be your next-of-kin, who would wish to oppose them?\"<ref name=\"thomson\" />  Thomson speculates that as ''Oresteia'' ends by validating the contemporary Athenian law regarding trial for murder by the court of [[Areopagus]], the Danaid plays may have ended by validating the contemporary Athenian law regarding marriage of next-of-kin when the husband dies without an heir.<ref name=\"thomson\" />  Thomson further suggests the possibility that as ''Oresteia's'' ending dramatizes the establishment of the court of Areopagus, the Danaid plays may have ended by dramatizing the establishment of the festival of the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival reserved for women which was based on the cult of [[Demeter]] which, according to [[Herodotus]], was brought to Greece from Egypt by the Danaids.<ref name=\"thomson\" />\n\nRidgeway, on the other hand, interpreted the plays as a dramatization of the conflict between [[matrilineal]] and [[patrilineal]] inheritance.<ref name=\"thomson\" />\n\n== Manuscripts ==\n\"The extant MSS. of the Supplices are very few.

It is a {{circa}} {{convert|30|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} mountain with an up-to-{{convert|8|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} [[caldera]] and [[parasitic vent]]s. Most of the volcano is formed by [[trachytic]] [[lava flow]]s, but [[hyaloclastite]] is also found. Snow, ice, and [[glacier]]s cover most of Mount Takahe; formerly it was thought that it had formed below ice. With a volume of {{Convert|780|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}, it is a massive volcano; the parts of the edifice that are buried underneath the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] are probably even larger. It is within the [[West Antarctic Rift System]] along with eighteen other known volcanoes.\n\nThe volcano was active in the [[Quaternary]]. [[Radiometric dating]] has yielded ages of 300,000{{nbsp}}years and less for its rocks. The fast-growing volcano reached its present height about 200,000 years ago. A number of [[tephra]] layers encountered in [[ice core]]s at [[Mount Waesche]] and [[Byrd Station]] have been attributed to Mount Takahe, although some of them were later linked to eruptions of [[Mount Berlin]] instead. The tephra layers were formed by [[explosive eruption|explosive]] or [[phreatomagmatic]] eruptions. Major eruptions took place around 17,700{{nbsp}}years ago\u2014which perhaps formed an [[ozone hole]] over Antarctica\u2014and in the early [[Holocene]], although late Holocene eruptions are also possible.

It is a {{circa}} {{convert|30|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} mountain with an up-to-{{convert|8|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide}} [[caldera]] and [[parasitic vent]]s. Most of the volcano is formed by [[trachytic]] [[lava flow]]s, but [[hyaloclastite]] is also found. Snow, ice, and [[glacier]]s cover most of Mount Takahe; formerly it was thought that it had formed below ice. With a volume of {{Convert|780|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}, it is a massive volcano; the parts of the edifice that are buried underneath the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] are probably even larger. It is within the [[West Antarctic Rift System]] along with eighteen other known volcanoes.\n\nThe volcano was active in the [[Quaternary]]. [[Radiometric dating]] has yielded ages of 300,000{{nbsp}}years and less for its rocks. The fast-growing volcano reached its present height about 200,000 years ago. A number of [[tephra]] layers encountered in [[ice core]]s at [[Mount Waesche]] and [[Byrd Station]] have been attributed to Mount Takahe, although some of them were later linked to eruptions of [[Mount Berlin]] instead.
