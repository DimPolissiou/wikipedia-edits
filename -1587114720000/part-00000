He had a goal disallowed later in the first half, when he was ruled offside after tapping in a cross by [[Ezequiel Lavezzi]] from the right wing. Germany responded when [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] raced into the penalty area and cut the ball back for Sch\u00fcrrle, who saw his first-time effort saved by a diving Argentine goalkeeper [[Sergio Romero]]. As the half ended Germany had a brief flurry of chances, the closest coming when [[Benedikt H\u00f6wedes|Benedikt H\u00f6wedes']] header hit the post from a corner during injury time.\n\nIn the second half [[Lionel Messi]] missed an early opportunity when he fired wide of the German goal from inside the penalty area after receiving a through pass, but the remainder of the half saw fewer chances with the closest coming from a Toni Kroos shot that went wide in the 81st minute. In the 88th minute, Germany\u2019s all-time leading scorer Miroslav Klose was substituted for [[Mario G\u00f6tze]]. This would be Klose\u2019s final appearance for Germany.\n\nEarly in the first half of [[extra time]] Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle received a pass in front of goal from G\u00f6tze, but his close-range shot was stopped by Romero.

He was replaced by [[Christoph Kramer]], who had made two brief substitute appearances during the tournament. Kramer himself suffered a head injury after a collision with [[Ezequiel Garay]] inside the penalty area, but was initially cleared to continue playing.  Fourteen minutes later in the 31st minute however, he collapsed to the ground, apparently suffering from concussion and was replaced by [[Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Germany\u2019s Christoph Kramer asked referee: \u2018Is this the final?\u2019|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/17/christoph-kramer-germany-concussion-world-cup-final-2014|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Messi in Germany and Argentina face off in the final of the World Cup 2014 -2014-07-13 (24).jpg|thumb|upright|Argentina's [[Lionel Messi]] (front) battles Germany's [[Mats Hummels]] for the ball.]]\n[[File:Germany and Argentina face off in the final of the World Cup 2014 -2014-07-13 (36).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentina striker [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] challenging Germany goalkeeper [[Manuel Neuer]].]]\nArgentina's [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] missed a good opportunity in the first half, dragging his shot wide after being put through on goal by a misjudged header from [[Toni Kroos]]. He had a goal disallowed later in the first half, when he was ruled offside after tapping in a cross by [[Ezequiel Lavezzi]] from the right wing. Germany responded when [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] raced into the penalty area and cut the ball back for Sch\u00fcrrle, who saw his first-time effort saved by a diving Argentine goalkeeper [[Sergio Romero]]. As the half ended Germany had a brief flurry of chances, the closest coming when [[Benedikt H\u00f6wedes|Benedikt H\u00f6wedes']] header hit the post from a corner during injury time.\n\nIn the second half [[Lionel Messi]] missed an early opportunity when he fired wide of the German goal from inside the penalty area after receiving a through pass, but the remainder of the half saw fewer chances with the closest coming from a Toni Kroos shot that went wide in the 81st minute. In the 88th minute, Germany\u2019s all-time leading scorer Miroslav Klose was substituted for [[Mario G\u00f6tze]]. This would be Klose\u2019s final appearance for Germany.\n\nEarly in the first half of [[extra time]] Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle received a pass in front of goal from G\u00f6tze, but his close-range shot was stopped by Romero. Minutes later, [[Rodrigo Palacio]]'s lob over [[Manuel Neuer]] went just wide after the forward jumped on a mistake by [[Mats Hummels]] in the German penalty area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28181689 |title=Germany 1 Argentina 0 |date=13 July 2014 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 July 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10959517/World-Cup-final-2014-Germany-vs-Argentina-as-it-happened.html |title=World Cup final 2014, Germany vs Argentina: as it happened |date=13 July 2014 |work=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=14 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of extra time [[Mario G\u00f6tze]] of Germany scored the winning goal in the 113th minute.

The church was originally a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church in Harrow, and was first mentioned in 1234. It was rebuilt in the early fourteenth-century, and rededicated in 1321. The parish became independent of St Mary's in 1766, when the first perpetual curate was appointed; not until the Wilberforce Act of 1868 did it appoint its first vicar, one William Hind.</ref> at the junction of the present day Grange Gardens, The High Street and Church Lane. The earliest surviving private dwelling, East End Farm Cottage, dates from the late fifteenth-century.<ref>Clarke, ''A History of Pinner'', p.18</ref>\n\nThe village expanded rapidly between 1923 and 1939 when a series of garden estates, including the architecturally significant Pinnerwood estate conservation area \u2013 encouraged by the [[Metropolitan Railway]] \u2013 grew around its historic core.<ref>Clarke, ''A History of Pinner'', pp.176\u2013184</ref> It was largely from this time onwards that the area (including [[Hatch End]], which forms the northeastern part of Pinner) assumed much of its present-day suburban character. The area is now continuous with neighbouring suburban districts including [[Rayners Lane]] and [[Eastcote]].\n\nPinner contains a large number of homes built in the 1930s Art Deco style, the most grand of which is the Grade II listed Elm Park Court at the junction of West End Lane and Elm Park Road.\n\nPinner has had an annual street [[fair]] held in May since 1336, when it was granted by [[Royal Charter]] by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]];.<ref>Clarke, ''A History of Pinner'', p.25</ref> Pinner is one of few places in the United Kingdom that still holds an annual fair, and it remains popular.\n\n==Governance==\n\nHarrow Council has been governed by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] since 2014. Pinner has two [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]], Pinner and Pinner South, each represented by three councillors.\nPinner is in the [[Brent and Harrow (London Assembly constituency)|Brent and Harrow]] constituency for the [[London Assembly]] which has been represented since 2008 by [[Navin Shah]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]).

The church was originally a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church in Harrow, and was first mentioned in 1234. It was rebuilt in the early fourteenth-century, and rededicated in 1321. The parish became independent of St Mary's in 1766, when the first perpetual curate was appointed; not until the Wilberforce Act of 1868 did it appoint its first vicar, one William Hind.</ref> at the junction of the present day Grange Gardens, The High Street and Church Lane. The earliest surviving private dwelling, East End Farm Cottage, dates from the late fifteenth-century.<ref>Clarke, ''A History of Pinner'', p.18</ref>\n\nThe village expanded rapidly between 1923 and 1939 when a series of garden estates, including the architecturally significant Pinnerwood estate conservation area \u2013 encouraged by the [[Metropolitan Railway]] \u2013 grew around its historic core.<ref>Clarke, ''A History of Pinner'', pp.176\u2013184</ref> It was largely from this time onwards that the area (including [[Hatch End]], which forms the northeastern part of Pinner) assumed much of its present-day suburban character. The area is now continuous with neighbouring suburban districts including [[Rayners Lane]] and [[Eastcote]].\n\nPinner contains a large number of homes built in the 1930s Art Deco style, the most grand of which is the Grade II listed Elm Park Court at the junction of West End Lane and Elm Park Road.\n\nPinner has had an annual street [[fair]] held in May since 1336, when it was granted by [[Royal Charter]] by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]];.<ref>Clarke, ''A History of Pinner'', p.25</ref> Pinner is one of few places in the United Kingdom that still holds an annual fair, and it remains popular.\n\n==Governance==\n\nHarrow Council has been governed by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] since 2014. Pinner has two [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]], Pinner and Pinner South, each represented by three councillors.\nPinner is in the [[Brent and Harrow (London Assembly constituency)|Brent and Harrow]] constituency for the [[London Assembly]] which has been represented since 2008 by [[Navin Shah]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]).
