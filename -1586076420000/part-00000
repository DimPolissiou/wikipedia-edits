Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth, transmitting the virus to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen. Cotillard, a fan of Soderbergh's work, first met with the director in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=dc/> The French actress was enthralled with the script because she was \"very concerned about germs.

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth, transmitting the virus to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.
