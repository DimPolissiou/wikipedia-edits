It was first released in Japan in March 1999, and was later released in June 1999 in North America and in September 2000 for [[PAL regions]]. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series, being one of the first console-based games for it, and featuring many Pok\u00e9mon rendered for the first time in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time 3D]]. The game was re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in December 2007 as well as [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2016.\n\nOriginally announced as a [[Nintendo 64DD]] title, development of ''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'' was moved to the Nintendo 64 due to the 64DD's delays. The gameplay is similar to other first-person games, viewing from the perspective of protagonist Todd Snap as he moves automatically on a rail. The objective of the game is to take pictures of Pok\u00e9mon, using items such as apples and \"pester balls\" to achieve better shots. After each round, players are judged based on the quality of their photos. The Virtual Console version features the ability to send pictures taken in the game to the [[Wii Message Board]] and send them to friends, whereas the Nintendo 64 cartridge could be taken to either [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] or [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] stores in North America and Japan to have pictures from the game printed on stickers.\n\nIts release was promoted heavily by Nintendo, including being featured in more than 86,000 hotels, and a contest to send the winner to [[Australia]]. By the end of 1999, ''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'' sold 1.5 million copies, and was a strong rental title in 1999 after its release. It was met with a mostly positive reception by critics, described as \"addictive\" by [[IGN]] and ''[[Boys' Life]]'', and \"innovative\" by ''[[Electric Playground]]''. It has also been compared to other video games with photography, such as ''[[Afrika (video game)|Afrika]]'', ''[[Dead Rising (video game)|Dead Rising]]'', and ''[[Beyond Good & Evil (video game)|Beyond Good & Evil]]''. It has also been used as a notable example of video games with photography.\n\n==Synopsis and gameplay==\n[[Image:POKEMON SNAP GAMEPLAY.jpg|thumb|left| Taking a picture of a [[Pikachu]] and [[Diglett]] in the \"Tunnel\" level]]\n{{nihongo|Todd Snap|\u30c8\u30aa\u30eb|Tooru}}, a Pok\u00e9mon [[photography|photographer]], is summoned by [[Professor Oak]] to [[Pok\u00e9mon Island]], a place with a variety of climatic and geographic regions where Pok\u00e9mon live relatively undisturbed by humans. Oak needs quality pictures to accompany his scientific findings, and knows from past experience that Todd is the right person for the job. Using a motorized, amphibious buggy named the Zero-One, Todd explores the island and takes photographs of the wide variety of Pok\u00e9mon that inhabit its environments.\n\nFrom Professor Oak's research hub, the player can select between the game's levels and features using a menu system. The Zero-One follows a linear path throughout the level, similar to a [[rail shooter]]. Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit. After completing a course, the player selects their best photos of each Pok\u00e9mon to be rated by Professor Oak and added to the Pok\u00e9mon Report. Scoring takes into account various aspects of the pictures, such as the Pok\u00e9mon's size, its pose, and keeping the Pok\u00e9mon in frame. Extra points are awarded for capturing a \"special\" pose or Pok\u00e9mon, such as a surfing [[Pikachu]], and if there are multiples of the same Pok\u00e9mon within the frame. Scoring well in the Pok\u00e9mon Report and photographing a wide variety of Pok\u00e9mon is required to make progress in the game. Players can also use an \"Album Mark\" to bookmark their favorite pictures; this adds the pictures to a personal in-game album to view at a later date or show to friends.\n\nPlayers start out with only a camera, but as they progress, Professor Oak will provide them with a number of special accessories used to obtain better photographs. The game features seven levels: Beach, Tunnel, Volcano, River, Cave, Valley, and the special course \"Rainbow Cloud\". However, the staggered acquisition of accessories ensures that the player must re-explore the courses to discover new material. Levels must be replayed after acquiring new accessories in order to locate hidden Pok\u00e9mon, alternate routes, or photographic opportunities that yield the best scores. The first accessory, apple-shaped Pok\u00e9mon food, can be thrown to either stun or attract Pok\u00e9mon. Another, \"Pester Balls\", are able to knock out Pok\u00e9mon or flush them out of hiding. The Pok\u00e9-Flute object is used in a variety of ways, such as awakening, irritating, or hatching Pok\u00e9mon. It can also cause Pok\u00e9mon to dance, and it can play three different songs, resulting in different dances from certain Pok\u00e9mon. Additionally, players can obtain a Dash Engine for the Zero One, allowing the vehicle to accelerate and move faster than normal.\n\nThe game features 63 of the [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|original generation]] of 151 Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n==Development==\n\n===''Jack and the Beanstalk''===\n''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'' originally started out as a non-Pok\u00e9mon game called ''Jack and the Beanstalk''. Named after [[Jack and the Beanstalk|the English fairy tale of the same name]], the game was intended for the [[64DD]], a peripheral for the Nintendo 64. The game was developed at HAL's office on the second floor of the Nintendo Kanda building in [[Sudach\u014d, Tokyo]], by a development team called \"Jack and Beans\".<ref name=\"Unseen64\">{{Cite web | author=U64 Staff & Contributors  | title=Jack and the Beanstalk [N64 DD \u2013 Cancelled] | url=https://www.unseen64.net/2010/10/29/jack-and-the-beanstalk-nintendo-64-dd-cancelled/ | date=29 October 2010 | website=Unseen64 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714164833/https://www.unseen64.net/2010/10/29/jack-and-the-beanstalk-nintendo-64-dd-cancelled/ | archive-date=14 July 2018 | url-status=live}}</ref> This name can be seen in the intro video of ''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'',<ref>{{Cite AV media | title=Pok\u00e9mon Snap \u2013 Intro | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK9FyJE4lU | date=2012-07-02 | format=[[YouTube]] video | publisher=cloudfangLP}}</ref> as well as in the credits.<ref>{{Cite AV media | title=[N64] Pok\u00e9mon Snap Credits ~ Version 1 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMy1BUhkA6E | date=30 January 2012 | publisher=Retroboxx}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title=Pok\u00e9mon Snap Credits | url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/pokmon-snap/credits | website=[[Moby Games]] | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818163708/https://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/pokmon-snap/credits | archive-date=18 August 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' was first revealed in February 1995, a year before the Japanese release of the N64, but the game was not heard from again.

It was first released in Japan in March 1999, and was later released in June 1999 in North America and in September 2000 for [[PAL regions]]. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series, being one of the first console-based games for it, and featuring many Pok\u00e9mon rendered for the first time in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time 3D]]. The game was re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] in December 2007 as well as [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2016.\n\nOriginally announced as a [[Nintendo 64DD]] title, development of ''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'' was moved to the Nintendo 64 due to the 64DD's delays. The gameplay is similar to other first-person games, viewing from the perspective of protagonist Todd Snap as he moves automatically on a rail. The objective of the game is to take pictures of Pok\u00e9mon, using items such as apples and \"pester balls\" to achieve better shots. After each round, players are judged based on the quality of their photos. The Virtual Console version features the ability to send pictures taken in the game to the [[Wii Message Board]] and send them to friends, whereas the Nintendo 64 cartridge could be taken to either [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] or [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] stores in North America and Japan to have pictures from the game printed on stickers.\n\nIts release was promoted heavily by Nintendo, including being featured in more than 86,000 hotels, and a contest to send the winner to [[Australia]]. By the end of 1999, ''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'' sold 1.5 million copies, and was a strong rental title in 1999 after its release. It was met with a mostly positive reception by critics, described as \"addictive\" by [[IGN]] and ''[[Boys' Life]]'', and \"innovative\" by ''[[Electric Playground]]''. It has also been compared to other video games with photography, such as ''[[Afrika (video game)|Afrika]]'', ''[[Dead Rising (video game)|Dead Rising]]'', and ''[[Beyond Good & Evil (video game)|Beyond Good & Evil]]''. It has also been used as a notable example of video games with photography.\n\n==Synopsis and gameplay==\n[[Image:POKEMON SNAP GAMEPLAY.jpg|thumb|left| Taking a picture of a [[Pikachu]] and [[Diglett]] in the \"Tunnel\" level]]\n{{nihongo|Todd Snap|\u30c8\u30aa\u30eb|Tooru}}, a Pok\u00e9mon [[photography|photographer]], is summoned by [[Professor Oak]] to [[Pok\u00e9mon Island]], a place with a variety of climatic and geographic regions where Pok\u00e9mon live relatively undisturbed by humans. Oak needs quality pictures to accompany his scientific findings, and knows from past experience that Todd is the right person for the job. Using a motorized, amphibious buggy named the Zero-One, Todd explores the island and takes photographs of the wide variety of Pok\u00e9mon that inhabit its environments.\n\nFrom Professor Oak's research hub, the player can select between the game's levels and features using a menu system. The Zero-One follows a linear path throughout the level, similar to a [[rail shooter]]. Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit. After completing a course, the player selects their best photos of each Pok\u00e9mon to be rated by Professor Oak and added to the Pok\u00e9mon Report. Scoring takes into account various aspects of the pictures, such as the Pok\u00e9mon's size, its pose, and keeping the Pok\u00e9mon in frame. Extra points are awarded for capturing a \"special\" pose or Pok\u00e9mon, such as a surfing [[Pikachu]], and if there are multiples of the same Pok\u00e9mon within the frame. Scoring well in the Pok\u00e9mon Report and photographing a wide variety of Pok\u00e9mon is required to make progress in the game. Players can also use an \"Album Mark\" to bookmark their favorite pictures; this adds the pictures to a personal in-game album to view at a later date or show to friends.\n\nPlayers start out with only a camera, but as they progress, Professor Oak will provide them with a number of special accessories used to obtain better photographs. The game features seven levels: Beach, Tunnel, Volcano, River, Cave, Valley, and the special course \"Rainbow Cloud\". However, the staggered acquisition of accessories ensures that the player must re-explore the courses to discover new material. Levels must be replayed after acquiring new accessories in order to locate hidden Pok\u00e9mon, alternate routes, or photographic opportunities that yield the best scores. The first accessory, apple-shaped Pok\u00e9mon food, can be thrown to either stun or attract Pok\u00e9mon. Another, \"Pester Balls\", are able to knock out Pok\u00e9mon or flush them out of hiding. The Pok\u00e9-Flute object is used in a variety of ways, such as awakening, irritating, or hatching Pok\u00e9mon. It can also cause Pok\u00e9mon to dance, and it can play three different songs, resulting in different dances from certain Pok\u00e9mon.

[[Satoru Iwata]], one of the producers of the game, explained in a 2010 interview: \"Originally, ''Pok\u00e9mon Snap'' for the Nintendo 64 system wasn't a Pok\u00e9mon game, but rather a normal game in which you took photos, but the motivation for playing the game wasn't clear. We wondered what players would enjoy taking pictures of, and later on we made a somewhat forced switch to taking pictures of Pok\u00e9mon.\" Masanobu Yamamoto, one of the character designers, initially had a negative reaction to the switch, since it meant that a lot of work he had put into the project had to be scrapped. He eventually realised the change was for the better though: \"That time, adopting the Pok\u00e9mon world clarified what we should do and the direction we should head, and I came to like Pok\u00e9mon, so I felt like that had saved us.\"<ref>{{Cite web | title=Three Themes: Surprise, Fun and Warmth | url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/kirbysepicyarn/0/3 | date=7 October 2010 | website=Nintendo.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118084247/http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/kirbysepicyarn/vol1_page4.jsp | archive-date=18 November 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | first=Thomas | last=East | title=Pok\u00e9mon Snap wasn't originally a Pok\u00e9mon game | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/20818/pokmon-snap-wasnt-originally-a-pokmon-game/ | date=25 October 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008133801/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/20818/pokmon-snap-wasnt-originally-a-pokmon-game/ | archive-date=2012-10-08 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, ''[[Mother (video game series)|Mother]]''/''[[EarthBound]]'' creator [[Shigesato Itoi]] posted a five-part article series about ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' on his site, 1101.com.

{"title_page": "Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony", "text_new": "[[File:Kitano Grand Tea Gathering monument.jpg|thumb|Grand Kitano Tea Gathering monument at Kitano Tenmangu shrine, Kyoto]]\nThe '''Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony''' (Japanese: \u5317\u91ce\u5927\u8336\u6e6f; ''Kitano \u014dchanoyu''), also known in English as the Grand Kitano Tea Gathering, was a large [[Japanese tea ceremony]] event that was hosted by the regent and chancellor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at [[Kitano Tenmang\u016b]] shrine in Kyoto on the first day of the tenth month in the year [[Tensh\u014d (Momoyama period)|Tensh\u014d]] 15 (1587). Japanese cultural historians view it as a major cultural event of the [[Momoyama period]]. Louise Cort points out these three reasons: The event was \"a key move in Hideyoshi's strategy to prove his cultural legitimacy; a turning point in the development of chanoyu style and theory; and a crisis in the personal relationship between its chief designers, two of the most influential figures of the Momoyama period, Hideyoshi and [[Sen no Riky\u016b]]\".<ref>Cort, Louise. \"The Grand Kitano Tea Gathering,\" Chanoyu Quarterly, no. 31 (Urasenke Foundation, Kyoto, 1982: {{ISSN|0009-1537}}), p. 15.</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\nToyotomi Hideyoshi, a warrior of humble background who rose to eventually become the national ruler, recognized cultural knowledge to be as important an attribute of leadership as military might and took up the practice of chanoyu as a means of demonstrating his cultivation. This had been the same with aspiring rulers before him, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]] in particular, whom Hideyoshi succeeded in the campaign to reunify the country after the fall of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]. To further enhance their image as legitimate rulers, Nobunaga and Hideyoshi after him sought to acquire works of art that had belonged to the Ashikaga sh\u014dguns. Nobunaga acquired some of those treasures as tokens of allegiance from warlords and merchants with whom he had formed political alliances. Others he ordered confiscated from their owners, often men whom he had defeated on the battlefield.<ref>Guth, Christine M.E., ''Art, Tea, and Industry: Masuda Takashi and the Mitsui Circle'', chapter 2, \"Art Collecting and Chanoyu,\" pp. 49-50. (Princeton Uni.

This was by prohibiting them from practicing chanoyu without his permission, and giving them esteemed art works for use in chanoyu as rewards for distinguished service.<ref>Murai, Yasuhiko. \"Biography of Sen Riky\u016b,\" pp. 28-29, in Chanoyu Quarterly no. 61.

He continued the course set by Nobunaga and, with respect to chanoyu, he took possession of Nobunaga's cherished art works for chanoyu use, symbols of his new wealth and culture.<ref>Kumakura, Isao. \"Sen no Riky\u016b: Inquiries into His Life and Tea\", in Varley, Paul and Kumakura, Isao (eds.), ''Tea in Japan: Essays on the History of Chanoyu'', pp. 34-35.

The visiting generals at that event followed custom by presenting him with art works for chanoyu use. On the 5th day of the 3rd month in 1585, he held a mammoth event at [[Daitoku-ji]], heartland of Zen power in the capital and training ground for many men who became lay monks as part of their chanoyu practice. The participants included twenty-five chanoyu practitioners from Sakai, fifty merchants from Kyoto, the monks of the temple, and Hideyoshi's commanders and allies. As the focal point of the event, Hideyoshi set up a display of his collection within the abbot's quarters of [[S\u014dken-in]], the subtemple which he himself had had built to commemorate Nobunaga's family. In the 5th month of 1587, Hideyoshi was victorious in his campaign against one of his last undefeated opponents, [[Shimazu Yoshihisa]], who had dominated most of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Hideyoshi had the support of the wealthy merchant, Kamiya S\u014dtan, and other prominent merchants in the port city of Hakata, and after his victory on the battlefield, he returned to Hakata, where he celebrated with a round of tea gatherings hosted by those influential merchants. The site for these tea gatherings was the seaside pine grove at Hakozaki. Then, just two weeks after his triumphant arrival back in Osaka, the notices went out announcing the Grand Kitano Tea Gathering.<ref>Cort, Louise. pp. 23-25.</ref> \n\nIt is especially notable that this grand event was intended to be impartial to social rank or wealth, and, together with Hideyoshi's own chanoyu venue, venues hosted by the three great chanoyu masters in Hideyoshi's service, who all were of the influential merchant class in the politically crucial city of Sakai, were designed as the special attractions.<ref>''Genshoku Chad\u014d Daijiten'' (Color-illustrated Chad\u014d Encyclopedia) entry, \"Kitano Daichakai\".

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.
