She is known for having walked {{convert|20|miles|km}} out of American-occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack.  Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime, but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada.  Though Laura Secord had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her with the [[Laura Secord Chocolates]] company, named after her on the centennial of her walk.\n\nLaura Secord's father, Thomas Ingersoll, lived in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] and fought on the side of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783).  In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of [[Upper Canada]] after he had applied for and received a land grant.  Shortly after, Laura married [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalist]] James Secord, who was later seriously wounded at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] early in the War of 1812.  While he was still recovering in 1813, the Americans invaded the [[Niagara Peninsula]], including [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]]. During the occupation, Secord acquired information about a planned American attack, and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant [[James FitzGibbon]] in the territory still controlled by the British.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots \u2013 A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women (Volume Two)|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=390}}</ref>  The information helped the British and their [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] warrior allies repel the invading Americans at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]].

Should it be assumed this is the British pound? -->\n\nThe story of Laura Secord has taken on mythic overtones in Canada.  Her tale has been the subject of books, plays, and poetry, often with many embellishments.  Since her death, Canada has bestowed honours on her, including schools named after her, monuments, a museum, a memorial stamp and coin, and a statue at the [[Valiants Memorial]] in [[Ottawa|the Canadian capital]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal history==\n\n===Family history and early life===\n\n[[Thomas Ingersoll]] (174<big>9\u20131812) married the</big> <small><sup>Small text</sup><sub>\u011e\u011e\u011e\u011e\u011e\u00e8\u00e3\u010c\u0118\u0118\u0118\u0124\u00ec\u013d\u0134\u0134\u0134\u0134\n== \n# Heading text\n* <br>\nBulleted list item<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n ==\n</sub></small>seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Dewey on 28 February 1775.

His paternal immigrant ancestor was Richard Ingersoll, who had arrived in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], from [[Bedfordshire]], England, in 1629.  Thomas was born in 1749 in [[Westfield, Massachusetts]].  Elizabeth, daughter of  Israel Dewey and his wife,{{sfn|Currie|1900|p=49}} was also born in Westfield,{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=16}} on 28 January 1758.{{sfnm|1a1=Currie|1y=1900|1p=49|2a1=Leavey|2y=2012|2p=16}}  Thomas moved to Great Barrington in 1774, where he settled into a house on a small piece of land by the [[Housatonic River]].  Over the next several years, his success as a [[Hatmaking|hatmaker]] allowed him to marry, increase his landholdings, and expand his house as his family grew.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=16\u201317}} He spent much time away from home, as he rose through the ranks in the military on the side of the [[patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Upon his return to Great Barrington, he was made a [[magistrate]].{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=25}}\n\nElizabeth gave birth to three more girls: Elizabeth Franks on 17 October 1779; Mira (or Myra) in 1781; and Abigail in September 1783.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=19}} They gave up Abigail for adoption in 1784 to an aunt with the surname Nash.{{sfnm|1a1=Currie|1y=1900|1pp=49\u201350|2a1=Leavey|2y=2012|2pp=15\u201316, 24}}  Elizabeth Ingersoll died 20 February 1784.{{sfn|Currie|1900|p=50}} Thomas remarried the following year to Mercy Smith, widow of Josiah Smith,{{sfn|Currie|1900|p=50}} on 26 May 1785.  Mercy had no children.  She has been credited with teaching her stepdaughters to read and do [[needlework]] before her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1789.  By adolescence, the eldest daughter Laura was caring for her sisters and looking after the household affairs.\n\nThomas remarried four months after Mercy's death, on 20 September 1789, to Sarah \"Sally\" Backus, a widow with a daughter, Harriet.  The couple had an additional four girls and three boys.  The first boy, Charles Fortescue, was born on 27 September 1791.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=24\u201326}}  Charlotte (born 1793) and Appolonia (born 1794) were the last members of this branch of the Ingersoll family to be born in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=31}}\n\nThomas helped suppress [[Shays' Rebellion]] in 1786, which earned him the rank of [[major (United States)|major]]. In the years following, he witnessed and was offended by the continuing [[Expulsion of the Loyalists#Attacks on Royal officials and Loyalists|persecution of Loyalists]] in Massachusetts.  He realized that in the depressed economic conditions that followed the Revolutionary War, and with his own deep debts, he was unlikely to see his former prosperity again.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=26\u201327}}  In 1793, Thomas met in [[New York City]] with [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leader [[Joseph Brant]], who offered to show him the best land for settlement in Upper Canada, where the Crown was encouraging development.  He and four associates travelled to [[Upper Canada]] to petition Lieutenant Governor [[John Graves Simcoe|John Simcoe]] for a land grant.  They received {{convert|66000|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} in the [[Thames Valley, Ontario|Thames Valley]], and founded Oxford-on-the-Thames (later known as [[Ingersoll, Ontario]]), on condition that they populate it with forty other families within seven years.  After winding up their affairs in Great Barrington, the Ingersoll family moved to Upper Canada in 1795.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=29\u201331}}\n\n===Upper Canada, marriage and children===\n\nThomas Ingersoll supported his family in their early years in Upper Canada by running a tavern in Queenston while land was being cleared and roads built in the settlement.  The family stayed in Queenston until a log cabin was completed on the settlement in 1796.  After Governor Simcoe returned to England in 1796, opposition grew in Upper Canada to the \"Late Loyalists\", such as Thomas, who had come to Canada for the land grants.  The grants were greatly reduced, and Thomas's contract was cancelled for not having all of its conditions fulfilled.  Feeling cheated, in 1805 he moved the family to [[Credit River]], close to York (present-day [[Toronto]]), where he successfully ran an inn until his 1812 death following a stroke.  Sally continued to run it until her own death in 1833.{{sfnm|1a1=Leavey|1y=2012|1pp=33, 35\u201337, 47|2a1=McKenzie|2y=1977|2p=29}}\n\nLaura Ingersoll remained in Queenston when the family moved.

Five Secord brothers, who were Protestant [[Huguenot]]s, fled from persecution in France and founded [[New Rochelle, New York]] in 1688.  At the time of the American Revolution, Loyalist members of the family [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] their surname to ''Secord''.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThe Secord couple lived in a house built in <!-- no apostrophe in St. Davids -->[[Niagara-on-the-Lake|{{not a typo|St. Davids}}]],<!-- no apostrophe in St. Davids --> the first floor of which was a shop.

He was among those who helped carry away Brock's body after Brock was killed in the first attack of the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] in October 1812.  James himself was severely wounded in the leg and shoulder during the battle.  Laura heard of his predicament and rushed to his side.  Some sources suggest that she found three American soldiers preparing to beat him to death with their gunstocks.  She begged them to save her husband's life, reportedly offering her own in return, when American Captain [[John E.

She told FitzGibbon that her husband had learned about it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord's informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with [[treason]] had Secord revealed her source.{{sfn|Berton|1981|p=63}}  In the 1860s, as Secord's story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her.{{sfn|Morgan|1994}}\n\nA number of historians have questioned Secord's account. [[William Stewart Wallace|W. Stewart Wallace]], in his 1932 book, ''The Story of Laura Secord: A Study in Historical Evidence'', concluded her story was mostly myth, and that she played no significant role in the outcome of the Battle of Beaver Dams.  Historian George Ingram contended in his 1965 book ''The Story of Laura Secord Revisited'' that Secord's debunking had been taken too far.  Ruth MacKenzie also burnished Secord's reputation with ''Laura Secord: The Legend and the Lady'' in 1971.{{sfn|Knowles|1997|p=206}}\n\nThe question of Secord's actual contribution to the British success has been contested.  In the early 1920s, historians suggested that Native scouts had already informed FitzGibbon of the coming attack well before Secord had arrived on 23 June.{{sfn|Wood|1920|pp=65\u201366}} Historian Ernest Cruikshank wrote in 1895 that \"Scarcely had Mrs Secord concluded her narrative, when [Ducharme's] scouts came in ... they had encountered the advance guard of the enemy.\"{{sfn|Cruikshank|1895|p=15}} Later, two testimonials were found which FitzGibbon wrote in 1820 and 1827, which supported Secord's claim.

She is known for having walked {{convert|20|miles|km}} out of American-occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack.  Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime, but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada.  Though Laura Secord had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her with the [[Laura Secord Chocolates]] company, named after her on the centennial of her walk.\n\nLaura Secord's father, Thomas Ingersoll, lived in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] and fought on the side of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783).  In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of [[Upper Canada]] after he had applied for and received a land grant.  Shortly after, Laura married [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalist]] James Secord, who was later seriously wounded at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] early in the War of 1812.  While he was still recovering in 1813, the Americans invaded the [[Niagara Peninsula]], including [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]]. During the occupation, Secord acquired information about a planned American attack, and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant [[James FitzGibbon]] in the territory still controlled by the British.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots \u2013 A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women (Volume Two)|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=390}}</ref>  The information helped the British and their [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] warrior allies repel the invading Americans at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]].  Her effort was forgotten until 1860, when [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] awarded the impoverished widow \u00a3100 for her service on his visit to Canada.<!-- the Canadian Pound lasted until 1858.  Should it be assumed this is the British pound? -->\n\nThe story of Laura Secord has taken on mythic overtones in Canada.  Her tale has been the subject of books, plays, and poetry, often with many embellishments.  Since her death, Canada has bestowed honours on her, including schools named after her, monuments, a museum, a memorial stamp and coin, and a statue at the [[Valiants Memorial]] in [[Ottawa|the Canadian capital]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal history==\n\n===Family history and early life===\n\n[[Thomas Ingersoll]] (1749\u20131812) married the seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Dewey on 28 February 1775.  Their first child, Laura, was born in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts|Great Barrington]] in the colonial [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] on 13 September 1775.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=16}}  Thomas's family had lived in Massachusetts for five generations.  His paternal immigrant ancestor was Richard Ingersoll, who had arrived in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], from [[Bedfordshire]], England, in 1629.  Thomas was born in 1749 in [[Westfield, Massachusetts]].  Elizabeth, daughter of  Israel Dewey and his wife,{{sfn|Currie|1900|p=49}} was also born in Westfield,{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=16}} on 28 January 1758.{{sfnm|1a1=Currie|1y=1900|1p=49|2a1=Leavey|2y=2012|2p=16}}  Thomas moved to Great Barrington in 1774, where he settled into a house on a small piece of land by the [[Housatonic River]].  Over the next several years, his success as a [[Hatmaking|hatmaker]] allowed him to marry, increase his landholdings, and expand his house as his family grew.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=16\u201317}} He spent much time away from home, as he rose through the ranks in the military on the side of the [[patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Upon his return to Great Barrington, he was made a [[magistrate]].{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=25}}\n\nElizabeth gave birth to three more girls: Elizabeth Franks on 17 October 1779; Mira (or Myra) in 1781; and Abigail in September 1783.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=19}} They gave up Abigail for adoption in 1784 to an aunt with the surname Nash.{{sfnm|1a1=Currie|1y=1900|1pp=49\u201350|2a1=Leavey|2y=2012|2pp=15\u201316, 24}}  Elizabeth Ingersoll died 20 February 1784.{{sfn|Currie|1900|p=50}} Thomas remarried the following year to Mercy Smith, widow of Josiah Smith,{{sfn|Currie|1900|p=50}} on 26 May 1785.  Mercy had no children.  She has been credited with teaching her stepdaughters to read and do [[needlework]] before her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1789.  By adolescence, the eldest daughter Laura was caring for her sisters and looking after the household affairs.\n\nThomas remarried four months after Mercy's death, on 20 September 1789, to Sarah \"Sally\" Backus, a widow with a daughter, Harriet.  The couple had an additional four girls and three boys.  The first boy, Charles Fortescue, was born on 27 September 1791.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=24\u201326}}  Charlotte (born 1793) and Appolonia (born 1794) were the last members of this branch of the Ingersoll family to be born in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=31}}\n\nThomas helped suppress [[Shays' Rebellion]] in 1786, which earned him the rank of [[major (United States)|major]]. In the years following, he witnessed and was offended by the continuing [[Expulsion of the Loyalists#Attacks on Royal officials and Loyalists|persecution of Loyalists]] in Massachusetts.  He realized that in the depressed economic conditions that followed the Revolutionary War, and with his own deep debts, he was unlikely to see his former prosperity again.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=26\u201327}}  In 1793, Thomas met in [[New York City]] with [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leader [[Joseph Brant]], who offered to show him the best land for settlement in Upper Canada, where the Crown was encouraging development.  He and four associates travelled to [[Upper Canada]] to petition Lieutenant Governor [[John Graves Simcoe|John Simcoe]] for a land grant.  They received {{convert|66000|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} in the [[Thames Valley, Ontario|Thames Valley]], and founded Oxford-on-the-Thames (later known as [[Ingersoll, Ontario]]), on condition that they populate it with forty other families within seven years.  After winding up their affairs in Great Barrington, the Ingersoll family moved to Upper Canada in 1795.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=29\u201331}}\n\n===Upper Canada, marriage and children===\n\nThomas Ingersoll supported his family in their early years in Upper Canada by running a tavern in Queenston while land was being cleared and roads built in the settlement.  The family stayed in Queenston until a log cabin was completed on the settlement in 1796.  After Governor Simcoe returned to England in 1796, opposition grew in Upper Canada to the \"Late Loyalists\", such as Thomas, who had come to Canada for the land grants.  The grants were greatly reduced, and Thomas's contract was cancelled for not having all of its conditions fulfilled.  Feeling cheated, in 1805 he moved the family to [[Credit River]], close to York (present-day [[Toronto]]), where he successfully ran an inn until his 1812 death following a stroke.  Sally continued to run it until her own death in 1833.{{sfnm|1a1=Leavey|1y=2012|1pp=33, 35\u201337, 47|2a1=McKenzie|2y=1977|2p=29}}\n\nLaura Ingersoll remained in Queenston when the family moved.  She married the wealthy James Secord, likely in June 1797.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=42}}{{efn|The exact date has not been determined as the marriage records were destroyed when the town was burned by the Americans in July 1814.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=42}} }}  The Secord family originated in France, where the name was spelled ''D'Secor'' or ''Sicar''.  Five Secord brothers, who were Protestant [[Huguenot]]s, fled from persecution in France and founded [[New Rochelle, New York]] in 1688.  At the time of the American Revolution, Loyalist members of the family [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] their surname to ''Secord''.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThe Secord couple lived in a house built in <!-- no apostrophe in St. Davids -->[[Niagara-on-the-Lake|{{not a typo|St. Davids}}]],<!-- no apostrophe in St. Davids --> the first floor of which was a shop.  Secord gave birth to her first child, Mary, in St. {{not a typo|Davids}} in 1799.  Mary was followed by Charlotte (1801), Harriet (10 February 1803),{{sfn|Leavey|2012|pp=42\u201343}} Charles Badeau (1809 \u2013 the only male child) and Appolonia (1810).{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=46}}\n\n===War of 1812===\n\nJames Secord served in the [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment|1st Lincoln Militia]]{{sfn|Firth|1966|p=180}} under [[Isaac Brock]] when the [[War of 1812]] broke out.  He was among those who helped carry away Brock's body after Brock was killed in the first attack of the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] in October 1812.  James himself was severely wounded in the leg and shoulder during the battle.  Laura heard of his predicament and rushed to his side.  Some sources suggest that she found three American soldiers preparing to beat him to death with their gunstocks.  She begged them to save her husband's life, reportedly offering her own in return, when American Captain [[John E. Wool]] happened upon the situation and reprimanded the soldiers.{{sfnm|1a1=Bryce|1y=1907|1p=7|2a1=McKenzie|2y=1977|2p=15}}  This story may have been a later embellishment{{sfn|McKenzie|1977|p=15}} and may have originated with her grandson, James B.

Lieutenant-Governor [[Peregrine Maitland]] did not offer him a position, but offered something to Laura.  He asked her to be in charge of the yet-to-be-completed [[Brock's Monument]].

Could they charge a fee and have a type of pension? -->  On 17 July 1831, Secord petitioned Colborne to honour Maitland's promise, and included another certificate from FitzGibbon attesting her contribution to the war.

In 1860, when Secord was 85, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]] heard of her story while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he learned of Laura Secord's plight as an aging widow and sent an award of \u00a3100. It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime.{{sfn|Leavey|2012|p=11}}\n\nLaura Secord died in 1868 at the age of 93.{{sfn|Carstens|Sanford|2011|p=140}}  She was interred next to her husband in the Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls.{{sfn|Richardson|2006}}  Her grave is marked by a monument with a bust on top, and is close to a monument marking the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]].{{sfn|Carstens|Sanford|2011|p=167}}\n\nThe inscription on her grave marker reads:\n\n{{quote|To perpetuate the name and fame of Laura Secord, who walked alone nearly 20 miles by a circuitous difficult and perilous route, through woods and swamps and over miry roads to warn a British outpost at DeCew's Falls of an intended attack and thereby enabled Lt.

Historian [[Pierre Berton]] noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of the impending attack.  She told FitzGibbon that her husband had learned about it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord's informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with [[treason]] had Secord revealed her source.{{sfn|Berton|1981|p=63}}  In the 1860s, as Secord's story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her.{{sfn|Morgan|1994}}\n\nA number of historians have questioned Secord's account. [[William Stewart Wallace|W. Stewart Wallace]], in his 1932 book, ''The Story of Laura Secord: A Study in Historical Evidence'', concluded her story was mostly myth, and that she played no significant role in the outcome of the Battle of Beaver Dams.  Historian George Ingram contended in his 1965 book ''The Story of Laura Secord Revisited'' that Secord's debunking had been taken too far.  Ruth MacKenzie also burnished Secord's reputation with ''Laura Secord: The Legend and the Lady'' in 1971.{{sfn|Knowles|1997|p=206}}\n\nThe question of Secord's actual contribution to the British success has been contested.  In the early 1920s, historians suggested that Native scouts had already informed FitzGibbon of the coming attack well before Secord had arrived on 23 June.{{sfn|Wood|1920|pp=65\u201366}} Historian Ernest Cruikshank wrote in 1895 that \"Scarcely had Mrs Secord concluded her narrative, when [Ducharme's] scouts came in ... they had encountered the advance guard of the enemy.\"{{sfn|Cruikshank|1895|p=15}} Later, two testimonials were found which FitzGibbon wrote in 1820 and 1827, which supported Secord's claim.  FitzGibbon asserted that Laura Secord had arrived on 22 June (not 23 June), and that \"in consequence of this information\", he had been able to intercept the American troops.{{sfn|McKenzie|2000}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[File:Laura Secord Homestead, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.jpg|alt=A white house in three-quarter perspective.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16\u20136, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10\u201310. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school. Donovan graduated during [[World War II]], though, and he served three years in the [[United States Navy]] before beginning his professional career in 1947.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nDonovan's career started far south of his home, with the [[Fort Lauderdale Braves]] of the [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Florida International League]]. He had a 7\u201315 [[Win-loss record (pitching)|record]] and a 4.17 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in his first professional season but still got promoted to the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Evansville Braves]] of the [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]].

However, he failed to make the team out of spring training this time, and the Braves tried to send him to their new AAA affiliate, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]]. Fearing he would remain in the minor leagues, Donovan requested a trade. \u201cI believed I could win in the major leagues and wanted a chance to prove it,\" he said.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> [[John Quinn (baseball executive)|John Quinn]] denied his request at first, then made him available, but he rejected all deals other teams tried to make for Donovan. Finally, [[Gene Mauch]], Donovan's former roommate and manager of the Braves' [[Class AA (baseball)|Class AA]] affiliate, convinced Donovan to come play for the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]].<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n\"That was the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Donovan said of getting sent to Atlanta. \u201cIt brought me under the wing of [[Whitlow Wyatt|[Whitlow] Wyatt]].\"<ref name=\"SABR\"/> A former pitcher for the Dodgers, Wyatt taught Donovan how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] while the [[Prospect (sports)|prospect]] was at Atlanta.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> Donovan appeared in 32 games (19 starts) for Atlanta, posting an 11\u20138 record, a 3.71 ERA, 132 strikeouts, and 51 walks in 182 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/> He got his wish after the season, when the Braves sold his contract to the [[Detroit Tigers]].<ref name=\"reference\"/> Donovan made the Tigers out of spring training but only appeared in two games before Detroit returned him to the Braves on May 13.<ref name=\"reference\"/> He was happy to accept another assignment to Atlanta, where Wyatt was now the manager.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> He responded with his best minor league season yet.

In 1954, he was the team MVP for Atlanta after hitting 12 home runs and driving in 38 runs in only 27 games.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> With the White Sox, he was frequently used as a pinch-hitter. At the plate in his 15-year major league career, Donovan posted a .163 batting average (113-for-694) with 67 runs, 15 home runs, 64 RBI, and 64 walks.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn February 7, 1959, Donovan married Patricia Casey, a [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], Massachusetts, resident who was a stewardess for [[United Airlines]]. The couple had two children, Peter and Amy. His friend Wyatt gave him the idea to sell insurance, and Donovan had a home business selling insurance during his MLB career. In 1963, he earned his stockbroker's license and joined the Boston-based firm Eastman & Dillon. After his baseball career, he served as the executive vice president for [[Bache & Co.]]. In 1980, he opened a real estate appraisal office in Quincy, which he ran until 1994. Additionally, Donovan served as distributor with Earth Care Products, a Quincy company that makes products out of recycled plastic.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16\u20136, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10\u201310. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school.
