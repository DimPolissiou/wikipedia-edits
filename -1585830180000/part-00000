They constituted the Northern part of the [[Burgundian State]]. The area comprised the major parts of present-day [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Hauts-de-France]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries}}\nA fair share (but not most) of these territories were inherited by the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] dukes, a younger branch of the French royal [[House of Valois]] in 1384, upon the death of Count [[Louis II, Count of Flanders|Louis II of Flanders]]. His heiress, [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders|Margaret III of Flanders]] in 1369 had married [[Philip the Bold]], youngest son of King [[John II of France]] and the first of the Valois dukes of Burgundy at [[Dijon]], who thus inherited the [[County of Flanders]]. The Flemish comital [[House of Dampierre]] had been French vassals, who held territory around the affluent cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], but also adjacent lands in former [[Lower Lorraine]] east of the [[Scheldt]] river (\"Imperial Flanders\") including the exclave of [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]], which were a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and furthermore the neighbouring French [[County of Artois]]. Together they initiated an era of Burgundian governance in the Low Countries.\n\nThe Dampierre legacy further comprised the French counties of [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] in northern [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[County of Nevers|Nevers]] west of Burgundy proper, both held by Philip's younger son [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip II]] from 1407, as well as the [[County of Burgundy]] (''Franche-Comt\u00e9'') east of it, an Imperial fief which had been part of the former [[Kingdom of Arles]].\n\nIn the following decades, the Burgundian dukes expanded their territories in the Low Countries by the acquisition of several [[Imperial State]]s: Duke [[Philip the Good]] purchased the [[County of Namur]] in 1421, inherited the Duchies of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] in 1430, and seized the Counties of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] in 1432, and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1441. His son, the last Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]], in 1473 annexed the Duchy of [[Guelders]], which had been pawned by late [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders|Arnold of Egmond]].\n\nThe Valois era would last until 1477, when Duke Charles the Bold died at the [[Battle of Nancy]] leaving no male heir. The territorial Duchy of Burgundy reverted to the French crown according to [[Salic law]], and King [[Louis XI of France]] also seized the French portion of the Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries. The Imperial fiefs passed to the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] House of Habsburg through Charles' daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. Maximilian however regarded the Burgundian Netherlands including Flanders and Artois as the undivided domains of his wife and himself and marched against the French. The conflict culminated at the [[Battle of Guinegate (1479)|Battle of Guinegate]] in 1479. Though Maximilian was victorious, he was only able to gain the County of Flanders according to the 1482 [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]] after his wife Mary had suddenly died, while France retained Artois.\n\nIn her testament, Mary of Burgundy had bequested the Burgundian heritage to her and Maximilian's son, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. His father, dissatisfied with the terms of the Arras agreement, continued to contest the seized French territories. In 1493, King [[Charles VIII of France]] according to the [[Treaty of Senlis]] finally renounced Artois, which together with Flanders was incorporated into the Imperial [[Seventeen Provinces]] under the rule of Philip.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population of the main provinces of the Low Countries in 1477.<ref>\tVan Houtte (J. \u0391.).

Attempts at enlarging personal control by the dukes resulted in revolts among the independent towns (sometimes supported by independent local nobles) and bloody military suppression in response. An increasingly modernized central government, with a bureaucracy of clerks, allowed the dukes to become celebrated art patrons and establish a glamorous court life that gave rise to conventions of behavior that lasted for centuries. Philip the Good (1419\u20131467) extended his personal control to the southeast; bringing Brussels, Namur, and Li\u00e8ge under his control. He channeled the traditional independence of the cities through such mechanisms as the first [[States-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], and consolidating of the region's economy.\n\nThe [[Estates General of 1464|first Estates General]] of the Burgundian territories met in the City Hall of [[Bruges]] on 9 January 1464. It included delegates from the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], [[Walloon Flanders|Lille, Douai and Orchies]], the [[County of Artois]], the [[County of Hainaut]], the [[County of Holland]], the [[County of Zeeland]], the [[County of Namur]], the [[Lordship of Mechelen]], and the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]].<ref>[[Wim Blockmans]], \"De samenstelling van de staten van de Bourgondische landsheerlijkheden omstreeks 1464\", ''Standen en Landen'' 47 (1968), pp. 57-112.</ref> Up to 1464, the Duke only maintained ties with each of the provincial States separately. In principle, the provincial Estates were composed of representatives of the three traditional [[Estates of the realm|estates]]: [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the Third Estate, but the exact composition and influence of each estate (within the provincial Estates) could differ. Convening an Estates General in which all provincial Estates were represented was part of [[Philip the Good]]'s policy of [[centralisation]].\n\n==Ducal patronage==\nFrom 1441, Philip based his ducal court in Brussels, but [[Bruges]] was the world center of commerce, though by the 1480s the inevitable silting of its harbor was bringing its economic hegemony to a close. Philip was a great patron of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and court painting reached new highs:  [[Robert Campin]], the famous [[Van Eyck]] brothers, and [[Rogier Van der Weyden]]\n\n==Social and economic==\nIn 1491 and 1492, the peasants revolted in some areas. They were suppressed by Maximilian's forces under the command of Duke Albert of Saxony at a battle at  [[Heemskerk]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Henk van Nierop|author-link=Henk van Nierop|title=Treason in the Northern Quarter: War, Terror, and the Rule of Law in the Dutch Revolt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEHiZejOzikC&pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=25}}</ref>\n\n==\"Burgundian character\"==\n\nIn the present-day [[Netherlands]], inhabitants of the [[cultural Christian|culturally Catholic]] area of [[Meierij van 's-Hertogenbosch]] are  considered by the other Dutch to have ''a Burgundian character'', meaning that they are supposed to be companionable people who like to party exuberantly.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Erwin Panofsky |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |title=Early Netherlandish Painting: Its Origins and Character |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1947 |isbn= }}\n*{{cite book |last=Prevenier |first=W. |last2=Blockmans |first2=W. |title=The Burgundian Netherlands |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |isbn=0-521-30611-6 }}\n*Stein, Robert. 2017.

Attempts at enlarging personal control by the dukes resulted in revolts among the independent towns (sometimes supported by independent local nobles) and bloody military suppression in response. An increasingly modernized central government, with a bureaucracy of clerks, allowed the dukes to become celebrated art patrons and establish a glamorous court life that gave rise to conventions of behavior that lasted for centuries. Philip the Good (1419\u20131467) extended his personal control to the southeast; bringing Brussels, Namur, and Li\u00e8ge under his control. He channeled the traditional independence of the cities through such mechanisms as the first [[States-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], and consolidating of the region's economy.\n\nThe [[Estates General of 1464|first Estates General]] of the Burgundian territories met in the City Hall of [[Bruges]] on 9 January 1464. It included delegates from the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], [[Walloon Flanders|Lille, Douai and Orchies]], the [[County of Artois]], the [[County of Hainaut]], the [[County of Holland]], the [[County of Zeeland]], the [[County of Namur]], the [[Lordship of Mechelen]], and the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]].<ref>[[Wim Blockmans]], \"De samenstelling van de staten van de Bourgondische landsheerlijkheden omstreeks 1464\", ''Standen en Landen'' 47 (1968), pp. 57-112.</ref> Up to 1464, the Duke only maintained ties with each of the provincial States separately. In principle, the provincial Estates were composed of representatives of the three traditional [[Estates of the realm|estates]]: [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the Third Estate, but the exact composition and influence of each estate (within the provincial Estates) could differ. Convening an Estates General in which all provincial Estates were represented was part of [[Philip the Good]]'s policy of [[centralisation]].\n\n==Ducal patronage==\nFrom 1441, Philip based his ducal court in Brussels, but [[Bruges]] was the world center of commerce, though by the 1480s the inevitable silting of its harbor was bringing its economic hegemony to a close. Philip was a great patron of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and court painting reached new highs:  [[Robert Campin]], the famous [[Van Eyck]] brothers, and [[Rogier Van der Weyden]]\n\n==Social and economic==\nIn 1491 and 1492, the peasants revolted in some areas.

It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Sharon|title=OS/2 EE to Get 3270 Interface Early|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=application+programming+interface&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWlZHBrYPoAhXlQd8KHWiECLMQ6AEwBHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=application%20programming%20interface&f=false|website=Google Books|date=1989}}</ref> An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be \"interrogated\" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details \"behind\" that API without affecting its users.  \n\nToday, with the rise of [[REST]] and [[web services]] over [[HTTP]], the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the [[#Web APIs|Web APIs]] section).  \n\nSometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.\n\n== Purpose ==\nIn building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstracting]] the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an [[email client]] might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file [[input/output]] might give the developer a [[Subroutine|function]] that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the [[Journaling file system|file system]] operations occurring behind the scenes.<ref name=\"Clarke4\">{{cite web|last1=3333Clarke|first1=Steven|title=Measuring API Usability|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654|website=Dr. Dobb's|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n\n===Libraries and frameworks===\nAn API usually is related to a [[library (computing)|software library]]. The API describes and prescribes the \"expected behavior\" (a specification) while the library is an \"actual implementation\" of this set of rules.\n\nA single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.\n\nThe separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another. For example, because [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] compile to compatible [[bytecode]], Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.<ref name=\"OderskySpoonVenners8\">{{cite web|last1=Odersky|first1=Martin|last2=Spoon|first2=Lex|last3=Venners|first3=Bill|title=Combining Scala and Java|url=http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html|website=www.artima.com|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=10 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAPI use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.\nAn API for a [[procedural programming|procedural language]] such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented language]], such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its [[class method]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Figueiredo|first1=Luiz Henrique|last2=Ierusalimschy|first2=Roberto|last3=Filho|first3=Waldemar Celes|title=The design and implementation of a language for extending applications|journal=TeCGraf Grupo de Tecnologia Em Computacao Grafica|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2778436|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sintes16\">{{cite web|last1=Sintes|first1=Tony|title=Just what is the Java API anyway?|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077392/java-se/just-what-is-the-java-api-anyway.html|website=JavaWorld|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2001-07-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Language binding]]s are also APIs.

An API approach is an architectural approach that revolves around providing a program interface to a set of services to different applications serving different types of consumers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/apis_for_dsi.pdf |website=www.hcltech.com |format=PDF download |title=API-fication |date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen used in the context of [[Web development tools|web development]], an API is typically defined as a set of specifications, such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, usually in an Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]) or JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]) format. An example might be a shipping company API that can be added to an eCommerce-focused website to facilitate ordering shipping services and automatically include current shipping rates, without the site developer having to enter the shipper's rate table into a web database. While \"web API\" historically virtually has been synonymous for [[web service]], the recent trend (so-called [[Web 2.0]]) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) based web services and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) towards more direct [[representational state transfer]] (REST) style [[web resource]]s and [[resource-oriented architecture]] (ROA).<ref>{{cite web\n |first        = Djamal\n |last         = Benslimane\n |author2      = Schahram Dustdar\n |author3      = Amit Sheth\n |title        = Services Mashups: The New Generation of Web Applications\n |url          = http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline/2008/09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |work         = IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 12, no. 5\n |publisher    = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n |pages        = 13\u201315\n |year         = 2008\n |access-date  = 2019-10-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211221/http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline%2F2008%2F09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |archive-date = 2011-09-28\n |url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> Part of this trend is related to the [[Semantic Web]] movement toward [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a concept to promote web-based [[ontology engineering]] technologies.

It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Sharon|title=OS/2 EE to Get 3270 Interface Early|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=application+programming+interface&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWlZHBrYPoAhXlQd8KHWiECLMQ6AEwBHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=application%20programming%20interface&f=false|website=Google Books|date=1989}}</ref> An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be \"interrogated\" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details \"behind\" that API without affecting its users.  \n\nToday, with the rise of [[REST]] and [[web services]] over [[HTTP]], the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the [[#Web APIs|Web APIs]] section).  \n\nSometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.\n\n== Purpose ==\nIn building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstracting]] the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an [[email client]] might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file [[input/output]] might give the developer a [[Subroutine|function]] that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the [[Journaling file system|file system]] operations occurring behind the scenes.<ref name=\"Clarke4\">{{cite web|last1=3333Clarke|first1=Steven|title=Measuring API Usability|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/measuring-api-usability/184405654|website=Dr. Dobb's|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n\n===Libraries and frameworks===\nAn API usually is related to a [[library (computing)|software library]].

While \"web API\" historically virtually has been synonymous for [[web service]], the recent trend (so-called [[Web 2.0]]) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) based web services and [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) towards more direct [[representational state transfer]] (REST) style [[web resource]]s and [[resource-oriented architecture]] (ROA).<ref>{{cite web\n |first        = Djamal\n |last         = Benslimane\n |author2      = Schahram Dustdar\n |author3      = Amit Sheth\n |title        = Services Mashups: The New Generation of Web Applications\n |url          = http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline/2008/09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |work         = IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 12, no. 5\n |publisher    = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n |pages        = 13\u201315\n |year         = 2008\n |access-date  = 2019-10-01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211221/http://dsonline.computer.org/portal/site/dsonline/menuitem.9ed3d9924aeb0dcd82ccc6716bbe36ec/index.jsp?&pName=dso_level1&path=dsonline%2F2008%2F09&file=w5gei.xml&xsl=article.xsl\n |archive-date = 2011-09-28\n |url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> Part of this trend is related to the [[Semantic Web]] movement toward [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a concept to promote web-based [[ontology engineering]] technologies.

It is useful to [[geologist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s who want to know when such an event occurred. It uses various methods to stimulate and measure [[luminescence]].\n\nIt includes techniques such as [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL), and [[thermoluminescence dating]] (TL). \"Optical dating\" typically refers to OSL and IRSL, but not TL.\n\n==Conditions and accuracy==\nAll [[sediment]]s and [[soil]]s contain trace amounts of [[radioactive]] [[isotope]]s of elements such as [[potassium]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[rubidium]]. These slowly [[Radioactive decay|decay]] over time and the [[ionizing radiation]] they produce is absorbed by mineral grains in the sediments such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable \"electron traps\". The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light (blue or green for OSL; [[infrared]] for IRSL) or heat (for TL) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.\n\nMost luminescence dating methods rely on the assumption that the mineral grains were sufficiently \"bleached\" at the time of the event being dated. For example,  in quartz a short daylight exposure in the range of 1\u2013100 seconds before burial is sufficient to effectively \u201creset\u201d the OSL dating clock.<ref name = \"Rhodes 2011\" /> This is usually, but not always, the case with [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] deposits, such as sand dunes and [[loess]], and some water-laid deposits.\nSingle \nQuartz OSL ages can be determined typically from 100 to 350,000 years BP, and can be reliable when suitable methods are used and proper checks are done.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Murray, A.

The dose rate is usually in the range 0.5 - 5 [[Gray (unit)|grays]]/1000 years. The total absorbed radiation dose is determined by exciting, with light, specific minerals (usually [[quartz]] or [[potassium feldspar]]) extracted from the sample, and measuring the amount of light emitted as a result. The [[photon]]s of the emitted light must have higher energies than the excitation photons in order to avoid measurement of ordinary [[photoluminescence]]. A sample in which the mineral grains have all been exposed to sufficient daylight (seconds for quartz; hundreds of seconds for potassium feldspar) can be said to be of zero age; when excited it will not emit any such photons.

It is useful to [[geologist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s who want to know when such an event occurred. It uses various methods to stimulate and measure [[luminescence]].\n\nIt includes techniques such as [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL), and [[thermoluminescence dating]] (TL). \"Optical dating\" typically refers to OSL and IRSL, but not TL.\n\n==Conditions and accuracy==\nAll [[sediment]]s and [[soil]]s contain trace amounts of [[radioactive]] [[isotope]]s of elements such as [[potassium]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[rubidium]]. These slowly [[Radioactive decay|decay]] over time and the [[ionizing radiation]] they produce is absorbed by mineral grains in the sediments such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable \"electron traps\". The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light (blue or green for OSL; [[infrared]] for IRSL) or heat (for TL) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.\n\nMost luminescence dating methods rely on the assumption that the mineral grains were sufficiently \"bleached\" at the time of the event being dated. For example,  in quartz a short daylight exposure in the range of 1\u2013100 seconds before burial is sufficient to effectively \u201creset\u201d the OSL dating clock.<ref name = \"Rhodes 2011\" /> This is usually, but not always, the case with [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] deposits, such as sand dunes and [[loess]], and some water-laid deposits.\nSingle \nQuartz OSL ages can be determined typically from 100 to 350,000 years BP, and can be reliable when suitable methods are used and proper checks are done.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Murray, A.

She suffered a breakdown due to the deterioration of her father's health. After this she worked in a glassware shop. She eventually joined the [[J.

The [[Whitechapel Gallery]] exhibition of [[Jackson Pollock]] in the winter of 1958 had an impact on her.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nHer early work was figurative and semi-impressionist. Between 1958 and 1959, her work at the advertising agency showed her adoption of a style of painting based on the [[Pointillism|pointillist]] technique.<ref name=\"Bridget Riley\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4929 Bridget Riley] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> Around 1960, she began to develop her signature [[Op Art]] style consisting of black and white geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye and produces movement and color.<ref name=\"Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 598-599\"/> In the summer of 1960, she toured Italy with her mentor Maurice de Sausmarez, and the two friends visited the [[Venice Biennale]] with its large exhibition of [[Futurism|Futurist]] works.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nEarly in her career, Riley worked as an art teacher for children from 1957\u201358 at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] (now known as ''Sacred Heart Language College''). At the Convent of the Sacred Heart, she began a basic design course.

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting ''Current'', 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show's catalogue. Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting ''Current'', 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show's catalogue. Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).
