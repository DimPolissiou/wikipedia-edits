He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of George Abercromby, a lawyer and descendant of the Abercromby family of Birkenbog, Aberdeenshire and Mary Dundas (d. 1767), daughter of Ralph Dundas of Manour, [[Perthshire]].

He served with his regiment in the [[Seven Years' War]], and thus, the opportunity afforded him of studying the methods of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], which moulded his military character and formed his tactical ideas.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abercromby, Sir Ralph|volume=1|page=44}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby rose through the intermediate grades to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the regiment (1773) and [[brevet (military)|brevet]] colonel in 1780, and in 1781, he became colonel of the newly raised [[103rd Regiment of Foot (King's Irish Infantry)|King's Irish infantry]].

He was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].\n\nIn July 1795, Abercromby was nominated by Secretary of State for War [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] to lead an expedition to the West Indies.

He again entered Parliament as member for Clackmannanshire from 1796 to 1798. From 1797 to 1798, he was Commander-in-Chief of the forces in [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nTo quote the biographic entry in the 1888 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, {{quote|\"There he laboured to maintain the discipline of the army, to suppress [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|the rising rebellion]], and to protect the people from military oppression, with the care worthy of a great general and an enlightened and beneficent statesman. When he was appointed to the command in Ireland, an invasion of that country by the French was confidently anticipated by the British government. He used his utmost efforts to restore the discipline of an army that was utterly disorganized; and, as a first step, he anxiously endeavoured to protect the people by re-establishing the supremacy of the civil power, and not allowing the military to be called out, except when it was indispensably necessary for the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of order.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFinding that (he) received no adequate support from the head of the Irish government, and that all his efforts were opposed and thwarted by those who presided in the councils of Ireland, he resigned the command.

The [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799 ended in disaster, but friend and foe alike confessed that the most decisive victory could not have more conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1801, Abercromby was sent with an army to recover [[Battle of Alexandria|Egypt from France]]. His experience in the Netherlands and the West Indies particularly fitted him for this new command, as was proved when he carried his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies to the destined scene of action despite great difficulties.

He twice served as MP for [[Clackmannanshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire]], rose to the rank of [[lieutenant-general]] in the [[British Army]], was appointed [[Governor of Trinidad]], served as [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland]], and was noted for his services during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].\n\n==Early life==\nRalph Abercromby was born on 7 October 1734 at [[Menstrie Castle]], [[Clackmannanshire]]. He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of George Abercromby, a lawyer and descendant of the Abercromby family of Birkenbog, Aberdeenshire and Mary Dundas (d. 1767), daughter of Ralph Dundas of Manour, [[Perthshire]].

Ralph attended [[Rugby School]] from 12 June 1748, where he remained until he was 18. Between 1752 and 1753, he was a student at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

He served with his regiment in the [[Seven Years' War]], and thus, the opportunity afforded him of studying the methods of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], which moulded his military character and formed his tactical ideas.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abercromby, Sir Ralph|volume=1|page=44}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby rose through the intermediate grades to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the regiment (1773) and [[brevet (military)|brevet]] colonel in 1780, and in 1781, he became colonel of the newly raised [[103rd Regiment of Foot (King's Irish Infantry)|King's Irish infantry]].

He was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].\n\nIn July 1795, Abercromby was nominated by Secretary of State for War [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] to lead an expedition to the West Indies. That same month he had been made a [[order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]] and in August Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Wight - a reward for his services but also possibly an incentive to lead the army in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> The appointment of Abercromby as Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward and Windward Islands was officially announced on 5 August.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Divall|first=Carole|title=General Sir Ralph Abercromby and the French Revolutionary Wars 1792-1801|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2019|isbn=978-1526741462|location=Barnsley|pages=72\u201373}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 1796 Abercromby arrived in [[Carlisle Bay, Barbados]] on the ''[[HMS Arethusa (1781)|Arethusa]].''<ref>Divall (2019). pp 84-85.</ref> A third of the 6,000 troops that had arrived on the island before him had already been sent on to [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]] and [[Grenada]], leaving the general with 3,700 soldiers at his disposal.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Martin R.|title=Death Before Glory: The British Soldier in the West Indies in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars 1793-1815|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2015|isbn=9781781593417|location=Barnsley|pages=94}}</ref> Control of much of Saint Vincent been lost to rebelling French planters and native Caribs since early 1795, while Grenada was in the midst of an [[F\u00e9don's rebellion|insurrection led by Julien F\u00e9don]].

He was also made [[Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight]], [[Governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus]] in the Scottish Highlands, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-general. He again entered Parliament as member for Clackmannanshire from 1796 to 1798. From 1797 to 1798, he was Commander-in-Chief of the forces in [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nTo quote the biographic entry in the 1888 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, {{quote|\"There he laboured to maintain the discipline of the army, to suppress [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|the rising rebellion]], and to protect the people from military oppression, with the care worthy of a great general and an enlightened and beneficent statesman. When he was appointed to the command in Ireland, an invasion of that country by the French was confidently anticipated by the British government. He used his utmost efforts to restore the discipline of an army that was utterly disorganized; and, as a first step, he anxiously endeavoured to protect the people by re-establishing the supremacy of the civil power, and not allowing the military to be called out, except when it was indispensably necessary for the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of order.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFinding that (he) received no adequate support from the head of the Irish government, and that all his efforts were opposed and thwarted by those who presided in the councils of Ireland, he resigned the command. His departure from Ireland was deeply lamented by the reflecting portion of the people, and was speedily followed by those disastrous results which he had anticipated, and which he so ardently desired and had so wisely endeavoured to prevent.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>}}\n\nAfter holding for a short period the office of [[commander-in-chief in Scotland]], Abercromby, when the enterprise against the Dutch [[Batavian Republic]] was resolved upon in 1799, was again called to command under the Duke of York. The [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799 ended in disaster, but friend and foe alike confessed that the most decisive victory could not have more conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1801, Abercromby was sent with an army to recover [[Battle of Alexandria|Egypt from France]]. His experience in the Netherlands and the West Indies particularly fitted him for this new command, as was proved when he carried his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies to the destined scene of action despite great difficulties. The debarkation of the troops at [[Abukir]], in the face of strenuous opposition, is justly ranked among the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie by Sir Robert Ker Porter (detail).jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie'' by Sir Robert Ker Porter.

During the action he was struck by a musket-ball in the thigh; but not until the battle was won and he saw the enemy retreating did he show any sign of pain. He was borne from the field in a hammock, cheered by the blessings of the soldiers as he passed, and conveyed on board the flag-ship [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS ''Foudroyant'']] which was moored in the harbour.

Zakynthos was then conquered by King [[Arkesios]] of [[Kefalonia]], and then by [[Odysseus]] from [[Ithaca]]. Zakynthos participated in the Trojan War and is listed in the Homeric [[Catalogue of Ships]] which, if accurate, describes the geopolitical situation in early Greece at some time between the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the eighth century BCE.

In 430 BC, the Lacedaemonians made an unsuccessful attack upon Zakynthos. The Zakynthians are then enumerated among the autonomous allies of Athens in the disastrous Sicilian expedition. After the [[Peloponnesian War]], Zakynthos seems to have passed under the supremacy of Sparta because in 374 BC, Timotheus, an Athenian commander, on his return from Kerkyra, landed some Zakynthian exiles on the island and assisted them in establishing a fortified post.

Tar is a more effective protector of ship planking than [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] (which is made from [[Pine|pine tree]]s). The Athenian [[trireme]] fleet needed protection from rot, decay and the [[Shipworm|teredo]], so this new source of tar was valuable to them.

The western half of the island is a mountainous plateau and the southwest coast consists mostly of steep cliffs. The eastern half is a densely populated fertile plain with long sandy beaches, interrupted with several isolated hills, notably [[Bochali]] which overlooks the city and the peninsula of [[Vasilikos, Zakynthos|Vasilikos]] in the northeast. The peninsulas of Vassilikos to the north and [[Marathia, Zakynthos|Marathia]] to the south enclose the wide and shallow bay of [[Laganas]] on the southeast part of the island.\n\nThe capital, which has the same name as the prefecture, is the town of [[Zakynthos (city)|Zakynthos]]. It lies on the eastern part of the northern coast. Apart from the official name, it is also called ''Chora'' (i.e. the Town, a common denomination in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town). The port of Zakynthos has a ferry connecting to the port of [[Kyllini (Elia), Greece|Kyllini]] on the mainland. Another ferry connects the village of Agios Nikolaos to [[Argostoli]] on Kefalonia. Minor uninhabited islands around Zakynthos included in the municipality and regional unit are: Marathonisi, Pelouzo, Agios Sostis in the Laganas bay; Agios Nikolaos, near the eponymous harbor on the northern tip; and Agios Ioannis near Porto Vromi on the western coast.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe mild [[Mediterranean climate]] and plentiful winter rainfall endow the island with dense vegetation. The principal agricultural products are [[olive oil]], [[Zante currant|currants]], grapes and [[citrus]] fruit. The Zante currant is a small sweet seedless grape that is native to the island.\n\nThe Bay of Laganas is the site of the first National [[Zakynthos Marine Park|Marine Park]] and the prime nesting area for [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') in the Mediterranean.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Zakynthos (1961\u20131990)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.2\n|Feb record high C = 21.4\n|Mar record high C = 24.2\n|Apr record high C = 25.6\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 35.8\n|Jul record high C = 42.2\n|Aug record high C = 38.4\n|Sep record high C = 36.8\n|Oct record high C = 30.4\n|Nov record high C = 26.6\n|Dec record high C = 22.2\n|year record high C = 42.2\n|Jan high C = 14.4\n|Feb high C = 14.5\n|Mar high C = 16.1\n|Apr high C = 18.9\n|May high C = 23.4\n|Jun high C = 27.8\n|Jul high C = 30.7\n|Aug high C = 30.6\n|Sep high C = 27.6\n|Oct high C = 23.0\n|Nov high C = 19.0\n|Dec high C = 15.8\n|year high C = 21.8\n|Jan mean C = 11.3\n|Feb mean C = 11.5\n|Mar mean C = 12.9\n|Apr mean C = 15.5\n|May mean C = 19.8\n|Jun mean C = 24.1\n|Jul mean C = 26.7\n|Aug mean C = 26.6\n|Sep mean C = 23.8\n|Oct mean C = 19.6\n|Nov mean C = 15.8\n|Dec mean C = 12.8\n|year mean C = 18.4\n|Jan low C = 8.1\n|Feb low C = 8.2\n|Mar low C = 9.2\n|Apr low C = 11.1\n|May low C = 14.4\n|Jun low C = 18.2\n|Jul low C = 20.4\n|Aug low C = 20.9\n|Sep low C = 18.8\n|Oct low C = 15.7\n|Nov low C = 12.5\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 13.9\n|Jan record low C = -2.6\n|Feb record low C = -2.0\n|Mar record low C = 0.0\n|Apr record low C = 2.6\n|May record low C = 5.0\n|Jun record low C = 8.4\n|Jul record low C = 12.0\n|Aug record low C = 13.4\n|Sep record low C = 10.8\n|Oct record low C = 5.2\n|Nov record low C = 2.8\n|Dec record low C = 0.2\n|year record low C = -2.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 150.4\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 89.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 51.3\n|May precipitation mm = 17.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 7.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 5.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 9.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 25.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 146.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 159.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 169.9\n|year precipitation mm = 943.3\n|Jan humidity = 74.3\n|Feb humidity = 72.8\n|Mar humidity = 72.8\n|Apr humidity = 71.7\n|May humidity = 67.8\n|Jun humidity = 62.8\n|Jul humidity = 59.3\n|Aug humidity = 61.2\n|Sep humidity = 66.7\n|Oct humidity = 71.7\n|Nov humidity = 76.0\n|Dec humidity = 75.3\n|year humidity = 69.4\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.8\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 8.2\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.1\n|May precipitation days = 2.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 1.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 0.9\n|Sep precipitation days = 2.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 13.2\n|year precipitation days = 78.5\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/GR/16719.TXT |title=Zakinthos Airport Climate Normals 1961\u20131990 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=March 2015\n}}\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:\u039d\u03b1\u03c5\u03ac\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf \u0396\u03b1\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Navagio]] ([[MV Panagiotis|shipwreck]]) bay]]\nFamous landmarks include the [[Navagio]] beach, a cove on the northwest shore isolated by high cliffs and accessible only by boat.

It also contributed to the development of modern Greek theatre. An important poet of this school was Zakynthian [[Dionysios Solomos]]; another was [[Nikolaos Koutouzis]], who also figures prominently in the Heptanese School of Painting. Others include [[Georgios Tertsetis]] (1800\u20131873, politician, poet, and historian).\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Zakynthos Airport, New Terminal, Greece 02.jpg|thumb|Zakynthos Airport]]\n\nThe island is covered by a network of roads, particularly the flat eastern part, with main routes linking the capital with Volimes on north, Keri on the south, and peninsula Vassiliki on the west. The road between Volimes and [[Lithakia]] is the spine of the western half of the island.\n\nThe island has one airport, [[Zakynthos International Airport]] (on former GR-35) which connects flights with other Greek airports and numerous tourist charters. It is located {{convert|4.3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from [[Zakynthos (city)|Zakynthos]] and opened in 1972.\n\nZakynthos also features two ports: the main port, located in the capital, and another in the village of [[Agios Nikolaos, Zakynthos|Agios Nikolaos]]. From the main port there is a connection to the [[port of Kyllini]], which is the usual route for arrivals to the island by sea from the mainland. From the port of Agios Nikolaos there is a connection to the island of [[Kefalonia]].\n\n==Science==\nTwo academic departments belonging to the [[Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands]] have been located on Zakynthos since 2003. The department of Environmental Technology and Ecology has developed laboratory and field station infrastructures along Zakynthos and the Strofades islets.

Zakynthos was then conquered by King [[Arkesios]] of [[Kefalonia]], and then by [[Odysseus]] from [[Ithaca]]. Zakynthos participated in the Trojan War and is listed in the Homeric [[Catalogue of Ships]] which, if accurate, describes the geopolitical situation in early Greece at some time between the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the eighth century BCE. In the Odyssey, Homer mentions 20 nobles from Zakynthos among a total of 108 of Penelope's suitors.<ref name=\"John Murray\">{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |date=1854 |publisher=John Murray |location=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] military commander [[Tolmides]] concluded an alliance with Zakynthos during the [[First Peloponnesian War]] sometime between 459 and 446 BC. In 430 BC, the Lacedaemonians made an unsuccessful attack upon Zakynthos. The Zakynthians are then enumerated among the autonomous allies of Athens in the disastrous Sicilian expedition. After the [[Peloponnesian War]], Zakynthos seems to have passed under the supremacy of Sparta because in 374 BC, Timotheus, an Athenian commander, on his return from Kerkyra, landed some Zakynthian exiles on the island and assisted them in establishing a fortified post.

Tar is a more effective protector of ship planking than [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] (which is made from [[Pine|pine tree]]s). The Athenian [[trireme]] fleet needed protection from rot, decay and the [[Shipworm|teredo]], so this new source of tar was valuable to them. The tar was dredged up from the bottom of a lake (now known as [[Keri, Greece|Lake Keri]]) using leafy [[Myrtus|myrtle]] branches tied to the ends of poles.

The island of [[Kefalonia]] lies {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north. It is the southernmost of the main group of the Ionian islands (not counting distant [[Kythira]]). Zakynthos is about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} wide, and covers an area of {{convert|405.55|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"stat01\"/> Its coastline is approximately {{convert|123|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long. According to the 2011 census, the island has a population of 40,759.<ref name=census11>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/1210503/resident_population_census2011rev.xls |script-title=el:\u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u2013 \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd 2011. \u039c\u039f\u039d\u0399\u039c\u039f\u03a3 \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 |publisher=Hellenic Statistical Authority |language=Greek}}</ref> The highest point is [[Vrachionas]], at {{convert|758|m|abbr=off}}.\n\nZakynthos has the shape of an [[arrowhead]], with the \"tip\" (Cape [[Skinari]]) pointing northwest. The western half of the island is a mountainous plateau and the southwest coast consists mostly of steep cliffs. The eastern half is a densely populated fertile plain with long sandy beaches, interrupted with several isolated hills, notably [[Bochali]] which overlooks the city and the peninsula of [[Vasilikos, Zakynthos|Vasilikos]] in the northeast. The peninsulas of Vassilikos to the north and [[Marathia, Zakynthos|Marathia]] to the south enclose the wide and shallow bay of [[Laganas]] on the southeast part of the island.\n\nThe capital, which has the same name as the prefecture, is the town of [[Zakynthos (city)|Zakynthos]]. It lies on the eastern part of the northern coast. Apart from the official name, it is also called ''Chora'' (i.e. the Town, a common denomination in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town). The port of Zakynthos has a ferry connecting to the port of [[Kyllini (Elia), Greece|Kyllini]] on the mainland. Another ferry connects the village of Agios Nikolaos to [[Argostoli]] on Kefalonia. Minor uninhabited islands around Zakynthos included in the municipality and regional unit are: Marathonisi, Pelouzo, Agios Sostis in the Laganas bay; Agios Nikolaos, near the eponymous harbor on the northern tip; and Agios Ioannis near Porto Vromi on the western coast.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe mild [[Mediterranean climate]] and plentiful winter rainfall endow the island with dense vegetation. The principal agricultural products are [[olive oil]], [[Zante currant|currants]], grapes and [[citrus]] fruit. The Zante currant is a small sweet seedless grape that is native to the island.\n\nThe Bay of Laganas is the site of the first National [[Zakynthos Marine Park|Marine Park]] and the prime nesting area for [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') in the Mediterranean.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Zakynthos (1961\u20131990)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.2\n|Feb record high C = 21.4\n|Mar record high C = 24.2\n|Apr record high C = 25.6\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 35.8\n|Jul record high C = 42.2\n|Aug record high C = 38.4\n|Sep record high C = 36.8\n|Oct record high C = 30.4\n|Nov record high C = 26.6\n|Dec record high C = 22.2\n|year record high C = 42.2\n|Jan high C = 14.4\n|Feb high C = 14.5\n|Mar high C = 16.1\n|Apr high C = 18.9\n|May high C = 23.4\n|Jun high C = 27.8\n|Jul high C = 30.7\n|Aug high C = 30.6\n|Sep high C = 27.6\n|Oct high C = 23.0\n|Nov high C = 19.0\n|Dec high C = 15.8\n|year high C = 21.8\n|Jan mean C = 11.3\n|Feb mean C = 11.5\n|Mar mean C = 12.9\n|Apr mean C = 15.5\n|May mean C = 19.8\n|Jun mean C = 24.1\n|Jul mean C = 26.7\n|Aug mean C = 26.6\n|Sep mean C = 23.8\n|Oct mean C = 19.6\n|Nov mean C = 15.8\n|Dec mean C = 12.8\n|year mean C = 18.4\n|Jan low C = 8.1\n|Feb low C = 8.2\n|Mar low C = 9.2\n|Apr low C = 11.1\n|May low C = 14.4\n|Jun low C = 18.2\n|Jul low C = 20.4\n|Aug low C = 20.9\n|Sep low C = 18.8\n|Oct low C = 15.7\n|Nov low C = 12.5\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 13.9\n|Jan record low C = -2.6\n|Feb record low C = -2.0\n|Mar record low C = 0.0\n|Apr record low C = 2.6\n|May record low C = 5.0\n|Jun record low C = 8.4\n|Jul record low C = 12.0\n|Aug record low C = 13.4\n|Sep record low C = 10.8\n|Oct record low C = 5.2\n|Nov record low C = 2.8\n|Dec record low C = 0.2\n|year record low C = -2.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 150.4\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 89.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 51.3\n|May precipitation mm = 17.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 7.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 5.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 9.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 25.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 146.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 159.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 169.9\n|year precipitation mm = 943.3\n|Jan humidity = 74.3\n|Feb humidity = 72.8\n|Mar humidity = 72.8\n|Apr humidity = 71.7\n|May humidity = 67.8\n|Jun humidity = 62.8\n|Jul humidity = 59.3\n|Aug humidity = 61.2\n|Sep humidity = 66.7\n|Oct humidity = 71.7\n|Nov humidity = 76.0\n|Dec humidity = 75.3\n|year humidity = 69.4\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12.8\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 8.2\n|Apr precipitation days = 6.1\n|May precipitation days = 2.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 1.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 0.9\n|Sep precipitation days = 2.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.1\n|Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 13.2\n|year precipitation days = 78.5\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/GR/16719.TXT |title=Zakinthos Airport Climate Normals 1961\u20131990 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=March 2015\n}}\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:\u039d\u03b1\u03c5\u03ac\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf \u0396\u03b1\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Navagio]] ([[MV Panagiotis|shipwreck]]) bay]]\nFamous landmarks include the [[Navagio]] beach, a cove on the northwest shore isolated by high cliffs and accessible only by boat.

It also contributed to the development of modern Greek theatre. An important poet of this school was Zakynthian [[Dionysios Solomos]]; another was [[Nikolaos Koutouzis]], who also figures prominently in the Heptanese School of Painting. Others include [[Georgios Tertsetis]] (1800\u20131873, politician, poet, and historian).\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Zakynthos Airport, New Terminal, Greece 02.jpg|thumb|Zakynthos Airport]]\n\nThe island is covered by a network of roads, particularly the flat eastern part, with main routes linking the capital with Volimes on north, Keri on the south, and peninsula Vassiliki on the west. The road between Volimes and [[Lithakia]] is the spine of the western half of the island.\n\nThe island has one airport, [[Zakynthos International Airport]] (on former GR-35) which connects flights with other Greek airports and numerous tourist charters. It is located {{convert|4.3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from [[Zakynthos (city)|Zakynthos]] and opened in 1972.\n\nZakynthos also features two ports: the main port, located in the capital, and another in the village of [[Agios Nikolaos, Zakynthos|Agios Nikolaos]]. From the main port there is a connection to the [[port of Kyllini]], which is the usual route for arrivals to the island by sea from the mainland. From the port of Agios Nikolaos there is a connection to the island of [[Kefalonia]].\n\n==Science==\nTwo academic departments belonging to the [[Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands]] have been located on Zakynthos since 2003.

At night, when he goes down to the living room, he bumps into his other self, the original Miles. Following an argument, they both decide to go to the Spa to find out what happened. At the Spa, Miles's clone feels overwhelmed and dissatisfied after learning the whole truth, since he knows neither why he was created nor what his purpose in life is. The original Miles tells him that he can disappear to travel the world and with no worries.
