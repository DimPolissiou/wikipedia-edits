They performed only three times as this incarnation, twice in New Zealand and once in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The live art performances included poetry and slide shows and were performed in art galleries. Their [[sound]] has changed greatly throughout the years, due to collaborating with a myriad of engineers, percussionists, guitarists, and like minded artists. Hieronymus Bosch were amongst those at the forefront of experimental music in New Zealand.\n\nAs part of an early 1986 performance the entire interior of a soon to be demolished house was torn apart in a frenzied ritual, accompanied by looping noise tapes fed through a generator driven PA system. Around 30 people took part in this now infamous display of art [[terrorism]].\n\nBosch were considered very experimental and 'outside the box'. \nThe mid 1980s saw them become a three piece of Gothic proportions, fusing Goth and Industrial along the lines of Neubauten / Foetus hatchling. This version only lasted a few months, but managed one, very loose live set which accompanied a gothic/dark art fashion show at an inner city nightclub.\n\n==Changes==\n1990 saw a new development. A guitarist, Morpheus Ire, was added from a local dark metal band and a [[bassist]]/[[percussionist]], Paul Blanchard, was recruited to play alongside the machines and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]],which instantly gave the group a whole new direction; one more chaotic, angst ridden and almost [[Anarchy|anarchic]]. Live performances meant the destruction of stage sets and props. Audience participation was always encouraged live. Hieronymus Bosch, though misunderstood by many during this period, attracted quite a large and loyal following from the [[Deathrock|death]]/[[Punk rock|punk]] and dark [[Heavy metal music|metal]] communities whilst still maintaining their dedicated [[Industrial rock|industrial]]/[[Experimental music|experimental]] fanatics. They performed quite extensively throughout 1990 - 1993. In the mid 1990s, Hieronymus Bosch resumed their earlier, more industrial sound. In 1996, Hieronymus Bosch reduced itself to two core members. Original member, Mark Bizarre and Trevor Donaldson, ex Sudersuk and classic NZ Punk band Armatrak joining, and the two headed off into some rather scary, electronic grinding 'nightmarescape' territories. \n''We've managed a few style changes overs the years but we always turned back to what we were all about''.\n\nTheir sound is a very personal one. Constantly drawing aural imagery from their own and others personal lives. Interests, beliefs, fears and desires are all contained within the 'nightmare [[soundtrack]]s'. [[Religion]] interests us, as does [[Life]] and [[Death]]. \"Our main influence is life itself as a whole. There is so much drama going on in the world. Life isn't dissimilar to a huge television screen, continuously playing and repeating random scenarios. One moment, a [[Horror fiction|horror]] show. [[War]], [[wikt:chaos|chaos]], [[death]] and [[fear]], the next, perfect families in sugar coated dream worlds. [[Spirituality]], Netherworlds of [[fantasy]] and escapism, The Paranormal, Occultism, [[Astronomy]] and the structure and complexities of the human mind all make appearances within the Bosch world. Our sound reflects as our own visions. Our views. Our way of thinking. Some pieces are slow and dark to depict the negatives of reality, (or [[Virtual reality]]), the down trodden and the weak, while other sections are lighter and somewhat uplifted. The balance is always there though. It seems to work\".\n\nHIERONYMUS BOSCH's music is constructed by combining the [[organic (model)|organic]] with [[electronic music|electronic]]. Nature vs [[Technology]]. Layering samples with movement. [[Frequencies]] and modulations with sounds of their own existence. They are both fans in the idea of power in [[minimalism]]. Creating huge rhythm through repetition and looping of sounds and samples. Constantly building and creating new directions and moods.\n\n==Releases==\nTheir first recorded efforts were on limited tape cassette format on zero budget and duplicated on a double stereo cassette deck. However a more adventurous visual project was to emerge in 1990, on video format.\"Our concept is a visual one, so we decided this was the best way to SHOW our sound\". The five track release entitled simply HIERONYMUS BOSCH - THE VIDEO was limited to 300 copies and was swallowed up quickly within the hungry world underground scene. \nIn 1997 HIERONYMUS BOSCH released a self-titled album of dark and horrific scapes which has been circulating well throughout the world, mainly around the [[UK]] and [[Europe]]an countries.\n\n1998 saw the creation of their second album, THE DIVIDED SELF.

Retrieved 22 December 2006.</ref> It was first administered by the [[Divine Word Missionaries]] or SVDs for a contract of 10 years. To date, IHMS has educated hundreds of diocesan and religious priests (see [[Paring Bol-anon]]) as well as lay alumni now serving in different capacities all over the [[Philippines]] and abroad. Currently,  there are more than a hundred seminarians studying at IHMS. The seminary is as much a unifying factor for the Paring Bol-anon and the different lay alumni groups since most of the members were once seminarians or professors there.<ref>Paring Bol-anon, USA 1996 Reunion Program Intro</ref>\n\n==Recent history==\nOn August 22, 2000, the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary celebrated its Golden Jubilee with the theme: \"Mary and the Priesthood and Evangelization.\"\n\nOn January 2010, Bishop Leonardo Y.

It was drawn and finalized by popular Tagbilaran artists, Ric Ramasola and Tony Arat in 1961.<ref>Bernard Fuertes. The ''Escudo'' or ''Escutcheon'' of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary</ref>\n\nThe ''escudo'' or ''escutcheon'' has five (5) major elements. The \"base\" represents God's omnipotent power and grace protecting or shielding Mary \u2013 represented by the monogram \"M\" \u2013 from original sin, as it was said by David: \"God, his was is immaculate...He is the shield of all that trust in Him.\" (2Kings 22:31) The \"Flaming Heart\" represents Mary's loving and maternal concern for the seminarians and professors of the seminary.  It is surrounded by \"Twelve Stars\" \u2013 adapted from her appearance to St. Bernadette of Lourdes in France telling her that \"I am the Immaculate Conception,\" hence the title, Immaculate Heart of Mary, is adopted.  Over the \"escudo\" is an open book representing the continuous search for knowledge by the seminarians through diligent studies.  It is highlighted by the \"Burning Torch\" representing the \"lumen Christi,\" or the light of Christ, which is always given to those who earnestly seek for knowledge and truth.\n\nThe search for knowledge goes along with the cultivation of the following good habits (other authors call them virtues) that an IHM seminarian should endeavor to ultimately internalize such as ''Pietas'' or Piety means the habit or virtue of rendering respect and obedience not only to God's commandment and those of the Church but also to the laws of the State.  Further, it means giving due respect and honor to both religious and civil superiors.  Piety must be founded on the virtue of humility, without which the former would be nigh, impossible to achieve.\n\n''Scientia'' or Science is the possession of this, especially divine science, is the result of a continuous search for knowledge under the aid of divine guidance; ''Sanctitas'' or Holiness is a virtue that is a must for all, most especially for seminarians and God's ministers.  It is a habit theologians say, of not being involved too much in worldly affairs, although in reality living in the world.  It corresponds to the pursuit of knowledge.  The more unworldly have attained a higher degree of science and sanctity.  That is why St. Thomas Aquinas is called the \"Angelic Doctor\" because he attained the highest degree of these virtues.  He is thereby honored by the Church and made the Patron of Catholic schools.\n\nThe year 1950 represents the seminary's year of foundation by Bishop Julio Rosales of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]]. The ''circlets'' at the base of the monogram of Mary and at the bottom of the \"escudo\" is an abstract or idealistic representation of the [[Society of the Divine Word]] ''(Societas Verbum Divini)''  or SVD whose fathers managed the seminary for the first 10 years of its existence under the first set of professors with Rev. Alphonse M. Mildner, SVD as Rector, together with Fr. Simeon O. Valerio (ret. Bishop of Calapan, Or. Mindoro), Fr. Victor Drewes and Fr. Victor Tunkel.\n\n===St. Joseph Vocation Society (SJVS)===\n\nThe St. Joseph Vocation Society or SJVS is a [[scholarship]] [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]] and IHMS. It was established in 1960 by then Fr. Felix S. Zafra (now deceased) with the purpose of supporting poor but deserving seminarians. Through the years, SJVS has sent many seminarians to the seminary who were ordained priests. Most of the [[Paring Bol-anon]] have received SJVS support. Funds come mainly from ordinary people through yearly house-to-house campaign by the seminarians. In 1989, SJVS launched a one-million-peso fund campaign. The [[Paring Bol-anon]] responded to the appeal. About two-thirds of the funds have been collected. In the [[United States]],  the proceeds of PB-USA Reunion dinners and concerts all go to the trust fund. Every year, the whole [[Paring Bol-anon]] offer masses for the intentions of SJVS benefactors and donors.\n\n===Jeduthun ensemble===\nThe Jeduthun Ensemble is the ''Schola Cantorum'' or the official choir of IHMS. Conducted by a priest Music Director, the Jeduthun serves as the backbone of all choral singing within the bounds of the seminary and its traditional yearly concert performed in the capital [[Tagbilaran City|city]] for the local community. From in-house performances to town fiesta gigs, the Jeduthun Ensemble's reputation as a solid, high quality, well-arranged and conducted choral group has easily landed them, in the past, invitations to perform in other venues outside of [[Bohol]], like [[Manila]], [[Iloilo]], [[Dumaguete]] and [[Mindanao]]. One could almost say that IHMS' musical practices and tradition has been the seedbed of many a present musical successes of many of its [[alumni]] in the field of music, like the pioneering acts of the ABCD Quartet of the '60s, the celebrated Singing Priests of [[San Francisco]] in mid '80s, the well-choreographed Singing Priests of [[Louisiana]] in late '80s and, not so recently, the very popular group, the high-powered Singing Priests of [[Tagbilaran]] ([http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=648617 SPOT]) in the late 90s. IHMS has also produced quite a number of prolific songwriters (TQ Solis Jr., Jimmy Borja) many of whom have won honors in different songwriters' competitions outside the four walls of the seminary, while some others have even chosen the field of music as their field of profession and livelihood.\n\nTo date, Jeduthun Ensemble alumni have been in varying degrees a continuing presence in the field of music locally and internationally. While some have made it in the music business (see [http://www.jimmyborja.com/ Jimmy Borja], [[Arnold Zamora]]), many of its priest-products (see [[Paring Bol-anon]]) have also demonstrated as much propensity in their musical pursuit as artists and producers in their respective rights. Like the pioneering Singing Priests of [[San Francisco]], who released the first ever studio-recorded [[Paring Bol-anon]] albums, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122834/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=659582 Inspirational Songs] (1985)'' and ''Christmas in San Francisco (1986),'' it did not take long for others PBs to follow suit. In 1993, Fr. Roland Pacudan released 2 musical albums of original works in [[Hawaii]] with ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182821/http://www.esnips.com/doc/6c7b74c2-a363-49da-84ff-e38f1bfd8b91/Citizens-of-the-World Citizens of the World]'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165137/http://www.esnips.com/doc/9a18cca9-c044-487f-971d-199607c25ad2/Roads-of-Life Roads of Life] (1994).Fr. Roland Pacudan authored three books, one in 2009 entitled \"Secundum Ordinem Vitae and two in 2010 entitled \"Ego Sum Qui Sum and \"Ordo Ab Chao\".'' While in [[New Orleans]], [[Roel Lungay|Fr. J. Roel Lungay]] produced four compilations of original songs written by him, and with other PBs like Frs. TQ Solis, Jr. Elpidio Biliran, Jr. and Arnold Zamora, with ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125641/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=651211 Mass of St. Rita] (1993)'', ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221616/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=650022 Dear Jesus] (1994),'' ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120510/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=650518 Music Revisited, Vol. 1] (1995)'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221610/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=649606 One Heart, One Mind] (1996).'' In 1998, spearheaded by nationally known composer and arranger, [[Arnold Zamora|Fr. Arnold Zamora]], the [[Singing Priests of Tagbilaran]] released their self-titled CD, ''[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=648617 SPOT],'' in San Francisco, while another longtime PB, in that same year, Msgr.

All the seminarians, both high school and college, together with the faculty-priests, are divided into 3 or 4 groups with each group assigned specific towns/municipalities to visit. The entire province is covered during the tour. The parish priest would host one group and would schedule them to visit the different parochial and public schools in the town. There the seminarians would give talk about life in the seminary and render a presentation to the students, inviting them to enter the seminary.\n\n===Summer apostolate===\nThe Summer Apostolate is part of the formation of seminarians that will allow them to engage in real-life apostolate work. It is usually held from April to May each year. It is during this period that the college seminarians are assigned to work in the different towns/municipalities of Bohol under the guidance of the Parish Priest.\n\n===Paring Bol-anon===\n''See: [[List of IHMS alumni Paring Bol-anon]]''\n[[File:Paring bol-anon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|logo of the Paring Bol-anon]]\n\nThe [[Paring Bol-anon]] or the [[Bohol]] [[Clergy]] is the fraternity of [[Roman Catholic]] priests who come from [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]], the majority of whom are currently serving in the [[parishes]] of the two dioceses in [[Bohol]], namely, the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]] and the [[Diocese of Talibon]], while a good number of them are also serving outside the [[Bohol|province]], most notably [[Manila]], [[Mindanao]] and the [[United States]], either as bishops, chaplains, pastors or guest priests.\n\n===Bohol Major Seminarians===\nIt all started in the mid and late seventies when IHMS alumni who moved on to the different major theological schools for their final priestly formation began organizing themselves into a viable entity or an [[organization]] wherein they can represent and speak for themselves on issues affecting the [[seminarians]] and students aspiring to become priests one day. Hence, the birth of the official organization of seminarians called the Bohol Major Seminarians. During these times many parish priests in the local parishes were not totally supportive of the seminary's and the diocese's summer program of sending seminarians to the different parishes for pastoral exposure in order to develop their skills in pastoral work. There were some seminarians who complained about being arbitrarily sent home by some parish priests and ended up being deprived of that rare and unique opportunity to learn first-hand the ins and outs of parish work, while on the other hand, many others, who were welcomed in their parish assignments, experienced a tremendously rich opportunity of actual parish life and even told stories of their hands-on experience which not only caused many to envy but also a major concern to the major seminarians and seminary formators. And so evolved from this the organization of seminarians called the BMS or the Bohol Major Seminarians, which eventually splintered into smaller groups, depending on what area of the [[Philippines]] they pursued further studies: BMS-[[Tagbilaran]], BMS-[[Cebu]], BMS-[[Mindanao]] and BMS-[[Manila]]. Eventually the BMS proved to be the catalyst that sparked the transformation of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]] and its clergy as well as the official founding of the [[Paring Bol-anon]] as a priestly fraternity in 1979 in a synod-like assembly of clergy that issued the first ever Diocesan Thrust.\n** BMS-Tagbilaran \u2013 College seminarians studying at IHMS\n** BMS-Cebu \u2013 Theology students studying at Seminario Mayor de San Carlos\n** BMS-Manila \u2013 Theology students studying at UST Pontifical Seminary, San Jose Major Seminary (Ateneo) and at Tagaytay seminaries (MSP, SASMA, DWS)\n** BMS-Mindanao \u2013 Theology students studying at any Mindanao seminaries (REMASE, DIOPEM, St. John Vianney)\n\n===Alumni associations===\nAlso See:''[[List of notable alumni of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary]]''\n\n* ''[[Paring Bol-anon]]'' \u2013 The association of Boholano priests based in different locations.\n* ''BANGK\u00c2'' \u2013 (Bol-anon Alang sa Nagkahiusang Katuyuan) the alumni association based in [[Manila]] was organized and registered with the SEC in the mid 1990s with Atty Mannix Cimafranca as the President.\n* ''TIPAS\u00ce'' \u2013 originally ''Tagbilaran Integration of ex-Priests And ex-Seminarians Inc.'', the alumni association based in [[Tagbilaran City]]. It was organized in 1986 with Timmy Balane as interim president. In 2000, during the presidency of Jun Amora, the acronym was solely used and the acronym's meaning dropped since the non-Tagbilaran based alumni were uneasy with the use of the word Tagbilaran. The word, TIPASI (in the vernacular meaning, an unhusked grain of rice), was thus used in the context of its meaning in the vernacular. It turned out to be the right move as other branches of TIPASI were established.\n** ''TIPAS\u00ce-Tagbilaran'' \u2013 the alumni association based in [[Tagbilaran City]] with Ariel Dominquez as president in 2006.\n** ''TIPAS\u00ce-Talibon'' \u2013 the alumni association based in [[Talibon]] with Palug Logro\u00f1o as president in 2006.\n** ''TIPAS\u00ce-Cebu'' \u2013 the alumni association based in [[Cebu City]] with Atty.

To date, IHMS has educated hundreds of diocesan and religious priests (see [[Paring Bol-anon]]) as well as lay alumni now serving in different capacities all over the [[Philippines]] and abroad. Currently,  there are more than a hundred seminarians studying at IHMS.

It was drawn and finalized by popular Tagbilaran artists, Ric Ramasola and Tony Arat in 1961.<ref>Bernard Fuertes. The ''Escudo'' or ''Escutcheon'' of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary</ref>\n\nThe ''escudo'' or ''escutcheon'' has five (5) major elements. The \"base\" represents God's omnipotent power and grace protecting or shielding Mary \u2013 represented by the monogram \"M\" \u2013 from original sin, as it was said by David: \"God, his was is immaculate...He is the shield of all that trust in Him.\" (2Kings 22:31) The \"Flaming Heart\" represents Mary's loving and maternal concern for the seminarians and professors of the seminary.  It is surrounded by \"Twelve Stars\" \u2013 adapted from her appearance to St. Bernadette of Lourdes in France telling her that \"I am the Immaculate Conception,\" hence the title, Immaculate Heart of Mary, is adopted.  Over the \"escudo\" is an open book representing the continuous search for knowledge by the seminarians through diligent studies.  It is highlighted by the \"Burning Torch\" representing the \"lumen Christi,\" or the light of Christ, which is always given to those who earnestly seek for knowledge and truth.\n\nThe search for knowledge goes along with the cultivation of the following good habits (other authors call them virtues) that an IHM seminarian should endeavor to ultimately internalize such as ''Pietas'' or Piety means the habit or virtue of rendering respect and obedience not only to God's commandment and those of the Church but also to the laws of the State.  Further, it means giving due respect and honor to both religious and civil superiors.  Piety must be founded on the virtue of humility, without which the former would be nigh, impossible to achieve.\n\n''Scientia'' or Science is the possession of this, especially divine science, is the result of a continuous search for knowledge under the aid of divine guidance; ''Sanctitas'' or Holiness is a virtue that is a must for all, most especially for seminarians and God's ministers.  It is a habit theologians say, of not being involved too much in worldly affairs, although in reality living in the world.  It corresponds to the pursuit of knowledge.  The more unworldly have attained a higher degree of science and sanctity.  That is why St. Thomas Aquinas is called the \"Angelic Doctor\" because he attained the highest degree of these virtues.  He is thereby honored by the Church and made the Patron of Catholic schools.\n\nThe year 1950 represents the seminary's year of foundation by Bishop Julio Rosales of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]]. The ''circlets'' at the base of the monogram of Mary and at the bottom of the \"escudo\" is an abstract or idealistic representation of the [[Society of the Divine Word]] ''(Societas Verbum Divini)''  or SVD whose fathers managed the seminary for the first 10 years of its existence under the first set of professors with Rev. Alphonse M. Mildner, SVD as Rector, together with Fr. Simeon O. Valerio (ret. Bishop of Calapan, Or. Mindoro), Fr. Victor Drewes and Fr. Victor Tunkel.\n\n===St. Joseph Vocation Society (SJVS)===\n\nThe St. Joseph Vocation Society or SJVS is a [[scholarship]] [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]] and IHMS. It was established in 1960 by then Fr. Felix S. Zafra (now deceased) with the purpose of supporting poor but deserving seminarians. Through the years, SJVS has sent many seminarians to the seminary who were ordained priests. Most of the [[Paring Bol-anon]] have received SJVS support. Funds come mainly from ordinary people through yearly house-to-house campaign by the seminarians. In 1989, SJVS launched a one-million-peso fund campaign. The [[Paring Bol-anon]] responded to the appeal. About two-thirds of the funds have been collected. In the [[United States]],  the proceeds of PB-USA Reunion dinners and concerts all go to the trust fund. Every year, the whole [[Paring Bol-anon]] offer masses for the intentions of SJVS benefactors and donors.\n\n===Jeduthun ensemble===\nThe Jeduthun Ensemble is the ''Schola Cantorum'' or the official choir of IHMS. Conducted by a priest Music Director, the Jeduthun serves as the backbone of all choral singing within the bounds of the seminary and its traditional yearly concert performed in the capital [[Tagbilaran City|city]] for the local community. From in-house performances to town fiesta gigs, the Jeduthun Ensemble's reputation as a solid, high quality, well-arranged and conducted choral group has easily landed them, in the past, invitations to perform in other venues outside of [[Bohol]], like [[Manila]], [[Iloilo]], [[Dumaguete]] and [[Mindanao]]. One could almost say that IHMS' musical practices and tradition has been the seedbed of many a present musical successes of many of its [[alumni]] in the field of music, like the pioneering acts of the ABCD Quartet of the '60s, the celebrated Singing Priests of [[San Francisco]] in mid '80s, the well-choreographed Singing Priests of [[Louisiana]] in late '80s and, not so recently, the very popular group, the high-powered Singing Priests of [[Tagbilaran]] ([http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=648617 SPOT]) in the late 90s. IHMS has also produced quite a number of prolific songwriters (TQ Solis Jr., Jimmy Borja) many of whom have won honors in different songwriters' competitions outside the four walls of the seminary, while some others have even chosen the field of music as their field of profession and livelihood.\n\nTo date, Jeduthun Ensemble alumni have been in varying degrees a continuing presence in the field of music locally and internationally. While some have made it in the music business (see [http://www.jimmyborja.com/ Jimmy Borja], [[Arnold Zamora]]), many of its priest-products (see [[Paring Bol-anon]]) have also demonstrated as much propensity in their musical pursuit as artists and producers in their respective rights. Like the pioneering Singing Priests of [[San Francisco]], who released the first ever studio-recorded [[Paring Bol-anon]] albums, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122834/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=659582 Inspirational Songs] (1985)'' and ''Christmas in San Francisco (1986),'' it did not take long for others PBs to follow suit. In 1993, Fr. Roland Pacudan released 2 musical albums of original works in [[Hawaii]] with ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182821/http://www.esnips.com/doc/6c7b74c2-a363-49da-84ff-e38f1bfd8b91/Citizens-of-the-World Citizens of the World]'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165137/http://www.esnips.com/doc/9a18cca9-c044-487f-971d-199607c25ad2/Roads-of-Life Roads of Life] (1994).Fr. Roland Pacudan authored three books, one in 2009 entitled \"Secundum Ordinem Vitae and two in 2010 entitled \"Ego Sum Qui Sum and \"Ordo Ab Chao\".'' While in [[New Orleans]], [[Roel Lungay|Fr. J. Roel Lungay]] produced four compilations of original songs written by him, and with other PBs like Frs. TQ Solis, Jr. Elpidio Biliran, Jr. and Arnold Zamora, with ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125641/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=651211 Mass of St. Rita] (1993)'', ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221616/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=650022 Dear Jesus] (1994),'' ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120510/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=650518 Music Revisited, Vol. 1] (1995)'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221610/http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=649606 One Heart, One Mind] (1996).'' In 1998, spearheaded by nationally known composer and arranger, [[Arnold Zamora|Fr. Arnold Zamora]], the [[Singing Priests of Tagbilaran]] released their self-titled CD, ''[http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=648617 SPOT],'' in San Francisco, while another longtime PB, in that same year, Msgr. Floro Arcamo, also of [[San Francisco]], with the help of long-time confrere, Fr.

All the seminarians, both high school and college, together with the faculty-priests, are divided into 3 or 4 groups with each group assigned specific towns/municipalities to visit. The entire province is covered during the tour. The parish priest would host one group and would schedule them to visit the different parochial and public schools in the town. There the seminarians would give talk about life in the seminary and render a presentation to the students, inviting them to enter the seminary.\n\n===Summer apostolate===\nThe Summer Apostolate is part of the formation of seminarians that will allow them to engage in real-life apostolate work. It is usually held from April to May each year. It is during this period that the college seminarians are assigned to work in the different towns/municipalities of Bohol under the guidance of the Parish Priest.\n\n===Paring Bol-anon===\n''See: [[List of IHMS alumni Paring Bol-anon]]''\n[[File:Paring bol-anon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|logo of the Paring Bol-anon]]\n\nThe [[Paring Bol-anon]] or the [[Bohol]] [[Clergy]] is the fraternity of [[Roman Catholic]] priests who come from [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]], the majority of whom are currently serving in the [[parishes]] of the two dioceses in [[Bohol]], namely, the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]] and the [[Diocese of Talibon]], while a good number of them are also serving outside the [[Bohol|province]], most notably [[Manila]], [[Mindanao]] and the [[United States]], either as bishops, chaplains, pastors or guest priests.\n\n===Bohol Major Seminarians===\nIt all started in the mid and late seventies when IHMS alumni who moved on to the different major theological schools for their final priestly formation began organizing themselves into a viable entity or an [[organization]] wherein they can represent and speak for themselves on issues affecting the [[seminarians]] and students aspiring to become priests one day. Hence, the birth of the official organization of seminarians called the Bohol Major Seminarians. During these times many parish priests in the local parishes were not totally supportive of the seminary's and the diocese's summer program of sending seminarians to the different parishes for pastoral exposure in order to develop their skills in pastoral work. There were some seminarians who complained about being arbitrarily sent home by some parish priests and ended up being deprived of that rare and unique opportunity to learn first-hand the ins and outs of parish work, while on the other hand, many others, who were welcomed in their parish assignments, experienced a tremendously rich opportunity of actual parish life and even told stories of their hands-on experience which not only caused many to envy but also a major concern to the major seminarians and seminary formators. And so evolved from this the organization of seminarians called the BMS or the Bohol Major Seminarians, which eventually splintered into smaller groups, depending on what area of the [[Philippines]] they pursued further studies: BMS-[[Tagbilaran]], BMS-[[Cebu]], BMS-[[Mindanao]] and BMS-[[Manila]]. Eventually the BMS proved to be the catalyst that sparked the transformation of the [[Diocese of Tagbilaran]] and its clergy as well as the official founding of the [[Paring Bol-anon]] as a priestly fraternity in 1979 in a synod-like assembly of clergy that issued the first ever Diocesan Thrust.\n** BMS-Tagbilaran \u2013 College seminarians studying at IHMS\n** BMS-Cebu \u2013 Theology students studying at Seminario Mayor de San Carlos\n** BMS-Manila \u2013 Theology students studying at UST Pontifical Seminary, San Jose Major Seminary (Ateneo) and at Tagaytay seminaries (MSP, SASMA, DWS)\n** BMS-Mindanao \u2013 Theology students studying at any Mindanao seminaries (REMASE, DIOPEM, St. John Vianney)\n\n===Alumni associations===\nAlso See:''[[List of notable alumni of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary]]''\n\n* ''[[Paring Bol-anon]]'' \u2013 The association of Boholano priests based in different locations.\n* ''BANGK\u00c2'' \u2013 (Bol-anon Alang sa Nagkahiusang Katuyuan) the alumni association based in [[Manila]] was organized and registered with the SEC in the mid 90's with Atty Mannix Cimafranca as the President.\n* ''TIPAS\u00ce'' \u2013 originally ''Tagbilaran Integration of ex-Priests And ex-Seminarians Inc.'', the alumni association based in [[Tagbilaran City]]. It was organized in 1986 with Timmy Balane as interim president. In 2000, during the presidency of Jun Amora, the acronym was solely used and the acronym's meaning dropped since the non-Tagbilaran based alumni were uneasy with the use of the word Tagbilaran. The word, TIPASI (in the vernacular meaning, an unhusked grain of rice), was thus used in the context of its meaning in the vernacular. It turned out to be the right move as other branches of TIPASI were established.\n** ''TIPAS\u00ce-Tagbilaran'' \u2013 the alumni association based in [[Tagbilaran City]] with Ariel Dominquez as president in 2006.\n** ''TIPAS\u00ce-Talibon'' \u2013 the alumni association based in [[Talibon]] with Palug Logro\u00f1o as president in 2006.\n** ''TIPAS\u00ce-Cebu'' \u2013 the alumni association based in [[Cebu City]] with Atty.

She had the ability to play well all three [[outfield]] positions, mainly at [[Center fielder|center field]], and was noted by her enthusiastic, positive, and hard team working. She made the most of her opportunities and averaged .247 lifetime during her nine-year career in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. A .140 hitter in her rookie season, she gradually improved her hitting to go along with her defense, batting over .300 in each of her last three years in the league.

She attended to [[spring training]] in 1946 after graduating from school and was rewarded with a contract to play with the [[Peoria Redwings]].<ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=21 1946 Peoria Redwings]</ref>\n\nFor the first time in 1946, league pitching rules were relaxed enough to allow for a limited side-arm pitch from an underhand delivery with certain restrictions and the season saw the rapid development of many pitchers as the adoption of the new style of pitching became general. Stoll struggled in her rookie season, hitting .164 in 58 games for last-place Peoria (33-79) in the eight-team league.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/>\n\nIn 1947 the AAGPBL moved its [[spring training]] camp to [[Havana, Cuba]], and Stoll was one of the two hundred girls who made the trip, this time as a member of the [[Grand Rapids Chicks]]. The girls trained, played eight days of exhibitions, and were cheered by more than 75,000 fans during games at the [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Gran Stadium]]. The new rules applied during the regular season permitted a full sidearm pitching delivery, and many players who developed hitting underhand pitching had problems adjusting to the new pitching style. As a result of the pitching domination, [[Dorothy Kamenshek]] was the champion bat with a significant .306 average, [[Audrey Wagner]] was the leader with seven [[home run]]s, and [[Elizabeth Mahon]] topped all hitters with 53 [[runs batted in]]. That season, Stoll collected a .163 average with 16 [[run (baseball)|runs]] and 12 RBI in 71 games, while Grand Rapids finished second (65-47) and advanced to playoffs. In the first round, the Chicks disposed of the [[South Bend Blue Sox]] in five games, and beat the [[Racine Belles]] in seven games, to clinch the championship.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=26 1947 Grand Rapids Chicks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430140935/http://aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=26 |date=2011-04-30 }}</ref>\n\nThe AAGPBL grew to an all-time peak of ten teams in 1948, representing Eastern and Western zones, just in the first year the circuit shifted to overhand pitching. At the time, the league shifted players as needed to help teams stay afloat, and Stoll was involved in the move. She was allocated to the [[Springfield Sallies]], in an effort to bolster the new squad. But the helpless Sallies finished as the worst team in the league, getting roughed up as a last-place expansion club with a 41-84 record, ending 35 and a half games behind Racine in the Western Division. The only regular to have a significant year for them was [[Evelyn Wawryshyn]], who tied for sixth place in the league with a .266 batting average, while ranking among the top ten hitters in [[stolen base]]s, [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] and 126 [[total bases]]. The pitching staff was led by the durable [[Doris Barr]], who posted a decent 2.68 [[earned run average|ERA]] with a career-high 116 [[strikeout]]s despite her 7-19 record. In her first shot as an everyday outfielder, Stoll hit .191 with 18 RBI and set career-highs with 61 runs scored and 116 games. The ill-fated Sallies folded at the end of the season, and Stoll was dealt to the South Bend team.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=46 1948 Springfield Sallies]</ref>\n\nWhen Stoll joined the Blue Sox in 1949 she took advantage of his new environment from the very beginning, raising her average to .232, while scoring 50 runs with 28 RBI in 99 games appearances. Throughout the regular season, South Bend waged an up-and-down battle with Rockford for first place. Although South Bend had a four-game lead in August, both clubs tied with identical records of 75-36 at the end of the year. On September 3, in the final home game of the regular season, [[Jean Faut]] of South Bend hurled a [[no-hitter]], a 2\u20130 victory against the [[Fort Wayne Daisies]], advancing her team to a tie for first place. In the first round of the playoffs, Grand Rapids defeated Fort Wayne in three games, and the [[Kenosha Comets]] were swept by the [[Muskegon Lassies]]. Then, in the semi-finals South Bend beat Muskegon (3-0) and Rockford did the same with Grand Rapids (3-1). The best-of-seven-series was clinched by Rockford, who eliminated South Bend in four straight games. By edict of league president [[Max Carey]], the playoff victory also made Rockford the regular season champion.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=48 1949 South Bend Blue Sox]</ref><ref name=SABR-Faut>{{sabrbio1|2030afb0|Jean Faut|Jim Sargent|November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 Stoll continued her batting progress, raising her average to .271 while driving in 50 runs and scoring 40 times in 91 games.

She posted a .268 average with 46 runs and 47 RBI, while sharing outfield duties with [[Elizabeth Mahon]] and [[Betty Wagoner]]. While South Bend placed third in the first-half standings, the team finished first in the second half, thus giving them a playoff berth. Their complete season record of 75 and 36 was best in the league that year. South Bend defeated Fort Wayne in the first round of the playoffs, two games to one, while Rockford swept Grand Rapids in two games. In the best-of-five championship round, defending AAGPBL champion Rockford won the first two games over the visiting South Bend, who won the next three games. In the 10\u20132 finale, Wagoner paced the Blue Sox with four hits and Faut earned the victory in a seven-inning relief, while [[Charlene Pryer]] and Stoll contributed three hits each. Considering that Rockford had won nine straight games, including the first two games in the championship series, South Bend came away a surprise winner to clinch the club's first AAGPBL title in the league.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/><ref name=SABR-Faut/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=63 1951 South Bend Blue Sox]</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Stoll topped the .300 mark for the first time, hitting .301 with 45 and 60 RBI, though she appeared in only 86 games.  South Bend finished second (64-45) in the six-team league, but dissension within the Blue Sox peaked just before the season ended, when infielder Pryer was disciplined following a dispute with manager [[Karl Winsch]]. In support of Pryer, five South Bend teammates, including Mahon and Stoll, joined her in a walkout, leaving Winsch's team short-handed for the playoffs with only twelve players.

Her most productive season came in 1953, when she hit a career-high .308 with 38 runs in 110 games and also posted career numbers in [[at-bat]]s (396), hits (122) and RBI (65), being selected for the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League All-Star Team|All-Star Team]]. In the end, Kalamazoo finished in third place with 56-50 mark and advanced to the playoffs, thanks to an improved lineup boosted by a good mixture of veteran players like [[Doris Sams]], [[Dorothy Schroeder]], [[Fern Shollenberger]] and the newcomer Stoll, along with younger players like [[Jean Lovell]] and [[Nancy Mudge]]. [[Gloria Cordes]] and [[June Peppas]] were the top pitchers of the team.

With the league reduced to five teams, due partly to financial problems and the difficulty of recruiting new players, the Lassies posted a fourth-place record of 48-49. In the first round of the playoffs, Kalamazoo defeated the second-place South Bend (48-44), two to one games, behind the strong pitching of [[Nancy Warren (baseball)|Nancy Warren]] and [[Elaine Roth]]. In the final round, Kalamazoo surprised the heavily favored Fort Wayne, three to two games, thanks to a clutch hitting of [[Chris Ballingall]] and [[Carol Habben]], appropriately dubbed the ''Home Run Twins'', and a nice hurling performance by Peppas in decisive Game 5, during what turned out to be the league's final season.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=SABR-Sams/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=40 1954 Kalamazoo Lassies]</ref><ref>{{sabrbio1|26e84b22|June Peppas|Jim Sargent|November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Life after baseball==\nAfter the league folded, Stoll owned her own dog grooming business in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] for many years.

She had the ability to play well all three [[outfield]] positions, mainly at [[Center fielder|center field]], and was noted by her enthusiastic, positive, and hard team working. She made the most of her opportunities and averaged .247 lifetime during her nine-year career in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. A .140 hitter in her rookie season, she gradually improved her hitting to go along with her defense, batting over .300 in each of her last three years in the league.

Stoll struggled in her rookie season, hitting .164 in 58 games for last-place Peoria (33-79) in the eight-team league.<ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/><ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/>\n\nIn 1947 the AAGPBL moved its [[spring training]] camp to [[Havana, Cuba]], and Stoll was one of the two hundred girls who made the trip, this time as a member of the [[Grand Rapids Chicks]].

Their first album of new material in eight years (the longest gap between albums to date), its recording followed the band's breakup and later reconciliation. Due to conflicts within the trio, the band entered an \"indefinite hiatus\" in 2005 and the members explored various side-projects. After two separate tragedies regarding the band and their entourage, the members of the band decided to reunite in late 2008, with plans for a new album and tour. It is the last studio album to feature the ''[[Enema of the State]]''-era lineup of the band, as founding member [[Tom DeLonge]] was terminated from the group in January 2015.\n\nThe band's studio autonomy, tours, managers and personal projects stalled the recording process, which lasted from shortly after the band's February 2009 reunion to July 2011. The band developed ''Neighborhoods'' in separate studios and regrouped at various periods to record. The band's numerous delays in the recording process resulted in the band canceling a European tour and the label setting a deadline for the album to be due. The trio wrote lyrics regarding such subjects as isolation, confusion and death. The band infused inspiration from each member's various musical tastes to form a unique sound that recalled their separate upbringings, leading the trio to compare the album to separate neighborhoods.\n\n''Neighborhoods'' was released to mixed reviews from critics; some felt it was a natural evolution from the band's previous releases, while others found it stale and disjointed. The album debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and \"[[Up All Night (blink-182 song)|Up All Night]]\" and \"[[After Midnight (blink-182 song)|After Midnight]]\" were released as [[single (music)|singles]], with both attracting modest success on ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Alternative Songs]] chart. Despite this, ''Neighborhoods'' did not sell as well as earlier releases and the band would depart from Interscope the following fall. The group would later look back on their comeback album with divided feelings; DeLonge would admit that the recording methods perhaps created less unity within the group.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Blink182.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Following Barker's near-fatal plane crash, DeLonge mailed Barker this 2003 photo of the trio aboard a submarine in the Middle East, reminding him of \"who we were.\"<ref name=\"rs\"/>]]\nBlink-182 announced on February 22, 2005 that they would be going on an \"indefinite hiatus\".<ref name=\"mtv4\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497320/blink182-announce-indefinite-hiatus.jhtml|title=Blink-182 Announce 'Indefinite Hiatus' As Breakup Rumors Swirl|author=James Montgomery|date=February 22, 2005|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref> The decision, in reality a break-up of the group, stemmed from internal band tension, which had arisen in late 2004 during the band's European tour. Guitarist and vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]] expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring in order to spend more time with family. Bassist and vocalist [[Mark Hoppus]] and drummer [[Travis Barker]] were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break.<ref name=\"IGNint\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/746/746190p1.html|title=+44 Interview|author=Spence D.|date=April 8, 2005|website=IGN|accessdate=April 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215200651/http://music.ign.com/articles/746/746190p1.html|archivedate=December 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at [[Music for Relief]]'s Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims.

Their first album of new material in eight years (the longest gap between albums to date), its recording followed the band's breakup and later reconciliation. Due to conflicts within the trio, the band entered an \"indefinite hiatus\" in 2005 and the members explored various side-projects. After two separate tragedies regarding the band and their entourage, the members of the band decided to reunite in late 2008, with plans for a new album and tour. It is the last studio album to feature the ''[[Enema of the State]]''-era lineup of the band, as founding member [[Tom DeLonge]] was terminated from the group in January 2015.\n\nThe band's studio autonomy, tours, managers and personal projects stalled the recording process, which lasted from shortly after the band's February 2009 reunion to July 2011. The band developed ''Neighborhoods'' in separate studios and regrouped at various periods to record. The band's numerous delays in the recording process resulted in the band canceling a European tour and the label setting a deadline for the album to be due. The trio wrote lyrics regarding such subjects as isolation, confusion and death. The band infused inspiration from each member's various musical tastes to form a unique sound that recalled their separate upbringings, leading the trio to compare the album to separate neighborhoods.\n\n''Neighborhoods'' was released to mixed reviews from critics; some felt it was a natural evolution from the band's previous releases, while others found it stale and disjointed.

{"title_page": "Wood flooring", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}\n[[Image:Flooring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An example of solid wood flooring with a top coating of [[polyurethane]]]]\n\n'''Wood flooring''' is any product manufactured from [[timber]] that is designed for use as [[flooring]], either structural or aesthetic.  Wood is a common choice as a flooring material and can come in various styles, colors, cuts, and species. [[Bamboo floor]]ing is often considered a form of wood flooring, although it is made from a [[grass]] ([[bamboo]]) rather than a timber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~mtaylo29/pages/Bamboo%20flooring.htm|title=Bamboo Flooring: Better than wood? |last=Taylor|first=Adam M.|year=2003|publisher=University of Tennessee|accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n1) Single joist timber flooring\n2)Double joist timber flooring\n3)Framed or Triple joist timber flooring\n=== Solid ===\n\n==== Hardwood flooring ====\nSolid [[hardwood]] floors are made of planks milled from a single piece of timber. Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building known as joists or bearers. With the increased use of concrete as a subfloor in some parts of the world, engineered wood flooring has gained some popularity. However, solid wood floors are still common and popular. Solid wood floors have a thicker wear surface and can be sanded and finished more times than an engineered wood floor.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vaglica |first1=Sal |title=All About Engineered Wood Floors |url=https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/all-about-engineered-wood-floors |website=This Old House |publisher=This Old House Ventures, LLC |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> It is not uncommon for homes in New England, Eastern Canada, USA, and Europe to have the original solid wood floor still in use today.\n[[File:Custom Showroom.jpg|thumb|Custom showroom]]\n\n==== Solid wood manufacturing ====\nSolid wood flooring is milled from a single piece of timber that is [[kiln]] or air dried before sawing. Depending on the desired look of the floor, the timber can be cut in three ways: flat-sawn, quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site-finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage.\n\nA number of proprietary features for solid wood floors are available. Many solid woods come with grooves cut into the back of the wood that run the length of each plank, often called 'absorption strips,' that are intended to reduce cupping. Solid wood floors are mostly manufactured {{convert|0.75|in}} thick with a tongue-and-groove for installation.\n[[File:Oak herringbone wood floor with two stripe wenge border.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Oak [[Herringbone pattern|herringbone]] [[parquet floor]] with two-strip wenge border]]\n\n===== Other wood manufacturing styles =====\n\n====== Rotary-peel ======\nThis process involves treating the wood by [[boiling]] the log in water.  After preparation, the wood is peeled by a [[blade]] starting from the outside of the log and working toward the center, thus creating a wood veneer. The veneer is then pressed flat with high pressure.  This style of manufacturing tends to have problems with the wood cupping or curling back to its original shape.    [[Lathe#Rotary lathes|Rotary]]-peeled engineered hardwoods tend to have a [[plywood]] appearance in the grain.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.woodfloorbusiness.com/installation/engineered-enigmas-know-these-answers-to-avoid-problems.html|title=Engineered Enigmas: Know These Answers to Avoid Problems - Wood Floor Business Magazine|website=www.woodfloorbusiness.com|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n====== Sliced-peel ======\nThis process begins with the same treatment process that the rotary peel method uses.

The increased stability of engineered wood is achieved by running each layer at a 90\u00b0 angle to the layer above. This stability makes it a universal product that can be installed over all types of subfloors above, below or on grade.

The tongue and groove fit snugly together, thus joining or aligning the planks, and are not visible once joined.  Tongue-and-groove flooring can be installed by glue-down (both engineered and solid), floating (engineered only), or nail-down (both solid and engineered).\n#\"Click\" or Woodloc systems: there are a number of patented \"click\" systems that now exist.  These click systems are either \"unilin\" or \"fiboloc\"  A \"click\" floor is similar to tongue-and-groove, but instead of fitting directly into the groove, the board must be angled or \"tapped\" in to make the curved or barbed tongue fit into the modified groove.  No adhesive is used when installing a \"click\" floor, making board replacement easier.  This system not only exists for engineered wood floors but also [[engineered bamboo]] and a small number of solid floors (such as \"parador solido click\") and is designed to be used for floating installations.  It is beneficial for the Do-It-Yourself market.\n#Floor connection system: There are a wide range of connection systems, as most of them are mill-specific manufacturing techniques.  The general principle is to have grooves on all four sides of the plank with a separate, unconnected, piece that is inserted into the grooves of two planks to join them.  The piece used for the connection can be made from wood, rubber, or plastic.  This installation system allows for different materials (i.e. wood and metal) to be installed together if they have the same connection system.\n#Wood flooring can also be installed utilizing the glue-down method.  This is an especially popular method for solid parquet flooring installations on concrete sub-floors.  Additionally, engineered wood flooring may use the glue-down method as well.  A layer of mastic is placed onto the sub-floor using a trowel similar to those used in laying ceramic tile.  The wood pieces are then laid on top of the glue and hammered into place using a rubber mallet and a protected 2x4 to create a level floor.  Traditionally, parquet floors will require sanding and re-finishing after the glue-down installation method due to the small size pieces. However, most new Engineered Parquet blocks don't require this extra step. \n#Floating installation: A floating installation is where the flooring is installed on top of a layer of underlayment or moisture barrier. The individual planks are glued together using a tongue and groove adhesive such as [[polyvinyl acetate|PVA wood glue]].  Space for expansion should be left at the edges of the room.  Cabinets and walls should not be installed on top of floating floors.

The wood is then oiled.\n\n=== Buffing ===\nGenerally, older solid hardwood floors need to be buffed every 3\u20135 years. The process usually takes about one day. Buffing refers to the process of using a stand up floor buffer. The floor is abraded with 180 grit screen on the buffer. This allows for the new coat of finish to mechanically adhere to the floor. This process works with great results as long as the floor hasn't had any waxes or synthetic cleaners.

Since most wood floors have a protective topcoat finish, the water migrates to the bottom of the floor plank, causing the plank to expand against the grain of the wood. Visually a wet floor will appear \"cupped\" due to this expansion. With the moisture source is removed, the wood floor will eventually release the excess moisture and return to normal, or what is known as equilibrium moisture content. In this \"dry\" condition the floor will again appear smooth and flat. This natural drying is a slow process and while the floor is wet (in excess of 15% moisture content), it can sustain structural damage or support microbial growth. Consequently, wood floor drying systems and methods have been developed to more quickly dry water damaged wood flooring and limit potential damage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dryhero.com/dryhero-water-damaged-hardwood-floor-drying-lincoln-nebraska|title=DryHero - Hardwood Floor Drying {{!}} Lincoln, NE|website=DryHero Water & Mold|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Parquetry]]\n*[[Reclaimed lumber]]\n*[[Reclaimed Wood Council]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Wood products}}\n\n[[Category:Floors]]\n[[Category:Wood products]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}\n[[Image:Flooring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An example of solid wood flooring with a top coating of [[polyurethane]]]]\n\n'''Wood flooring''' is any product manufactured from [[timber]] that is designed for use as [[flooring]], either structural or aesthetic.

Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building known as joists or bearers. With the increased use of concrete as a subfloor in some parts of the world, engineered wood flooring has gained some popularity. However, solid wood floors are still common and popular.

Depending on the desired look of the floor, the timber can be cut in three ways: flat-sawn, quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site-finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage.\n\nA number of proprietary features for solid wood floors are available. Many solid woods come with grooves cut into the back of the wood that run the length of each plank, often called 'absorption strips,' that are intended to reduce cupping. Solid wood floors are mostly manufactured {{convert|0.75|in}} thick with a tongue-and-groove for installation.\n[[File:Oak herringbone wood floor with two stripe wenge border.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Oak [[Herringbone pattern|herringbone]] [[parquet floor]] with two-strip wenge border]]\n\n===== Other wood manufacturing styles =====\n\n====== Rotary-peel ======\nThis process involves treating the wood by [[boiling]] the log in water.  After preparation, the wood is peeled by a [[blade]] starting from the outside of the log and working toward the center, thus creating a wood veneer. The veneer is then pressed flat with high pressure.  This style of manufacturing tends to have problems with the wood cupping or curling back to its original shape.
