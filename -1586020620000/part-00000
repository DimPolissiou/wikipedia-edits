However, the director of the laboratory, Elizabeth Wictum, pointed out that while the results were \"fairly significant\", they were not conclusive. Only mitochondrial DNA was tested which, unlike nuclear DNA, cannot be shown to be unique to one dog. This means that while the report said the hairs on the bodies contained the same DNA sequence as Williams' dog, the same DNA sequence occurs in about 1 in 100 dogs.<ref>{{cite web|title = DA: DNA Tests Link Williams to Killings|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062601058.html|author = Harry R.
