This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his hacker friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

Cara gets closer to her estranged mother, while Ali convinces her father to support Miles and congratulate him on his podcast's success. Miles disagrees with his new producer, who wants a one-sided presentation about atheism. Miles instead wants his show to be more of an open conversation. Due to the change in tone, Miles's podcast loses over half its audience.

Hasan confronts Tara and David (and Miles) at the courthouse just before their marriage. Miles tries to reason with Hasan, but fails, and Tara reluctantly leaves with her father.

However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution.

Corey and Rakesh consult Zack for help in hacking into the DoD mainframe again, with hopes of locating Corey's code and identifying who is manipulating it for the God account. Meanwhile, Miles and Cara follow up on friend suggestion Russell, a single father with a baby who fails to appear for a hearing on a grand theft auto charge. They track down Russell before he flees to Buffalo, and learn that he was just hired to transport the vehicle. They get former friend suggestions Sameer and Jai to represent Russell, but he is still captured by bounty hunter Bonnie. Russell and Bonnie bond over both being former foster children, and the group tracks down the man who hired Russell to move the vehicle. While Russell is absolved of the theft charge, he still has to serve six months for contempt and failure to appear. Bonnie agrees to look after Russell's child until he is freed. Also, Ally starts losing her hair, and lashes out at Miles and Arthur when they try to be supportive, while Miles becomes aware that Cara is dating Adam.\n |LineColor       = 549FC3\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 40\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 20\n |Title           = Collateral Damage\n |DirectedBy      = Darren Grant\n |WrittenBy       = Lydia Teffera & Sam Lifshutz\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|19}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = \n |ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his hacker friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

To recover his clients' losses, Paul has resorted to [[insider trading]] and is seen consulting with the target of a story that Cara is working with her partner. Despite Cara asking him to stay out of it, Miles implores Paul to do the right thing. After almost fleeing to Canada, Paul instead takes a plea deal that will result in him spending one to two years in prison. Cara accuses Miles of putting the God account before her, much like Gideon suggested might happen. Elsewhere, Arthur finds his new agenda being blocked by Reverend Elias, a very conservative member of his board who cites Arthur's children and out-of-wedlock relationship with Trish as reasons he should step down. Surprisingly, it's Trish who gets Arthur to stand up for what he believes is best for the church.

Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account. Seeing how Miles just effectively saved two lives, Cara insists she could never live with the thought that she prevented Miles from doing more good work, and she ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Arthur makes good on his promise to balance church duties with spending time with Trish, causing Trish to say she wants to marry him as soon as possible.

The hacker reveals he was hired by a man named Alphonse Jeffries to create the back door. While Rakesh tracks down that lead, Miles and Joy help an elderly holocaust survivor named Abe ([[Judd Hirsch]]), who noticed his father's gold watch on a jewelry auction site and hopes it can lead him to answers about his long-lost sister, Rose. Soon after a successful resolution of that case, Miles learns that Alphonse and Arthur served in Vietnam together and, in fact, Arthur saved Alphonse's life. Having revealed that he and Trish are getting married that weekend, Arthur says he invited Alphonse to the wedding. Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara.

Rakesh and Joy are finally able to corner Jeffries, and he agrees to lunch with them. When Jeffries is a no-show for lunch, Miles tracks him down. He tells Jeffries he knows he's behind the God account, but Jeffries denies it. Miles then asks Jeffries why he would hire a hacker to create a back door for the New York Sun client information, and Jeffries replies he didn't hire anyone. Miles, Rakesh and Joy then race to the apartment where they previously met the hacker, and find it completely cleaned out except for one item: a Queen of Hearts playing card.

Mr. Johnson says that they are closing the cinema for good in two days.

Due to his reputation, in 1904 he was given funding to construct a small chapel on Mount-Royal across from [[Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur|Notre Dame College]]<ref name=\"Pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>  to operate out of. The small, [[Gothic Revival Architecture|Gothic Revival]] style chapel expanded four times over the next decade with the growing of Brother Andr\u00e9's fame and the Congregation decided to fulfill his request to build a [[basilica]] in his patron saint, [[Saint Joseph]]'s honor. The original chapel, measuring 4.5 meters by 5.5 meters still stands today, though it has since been relocated about a hundred meters away to make room for the massive basilica that stands today.\n[[File:Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette.jpg|thumb||left|[[Andr\u00e9 Bessette]], [[Congregation of Holy Cross|C.S.C.]], commonly known as Brother Andr\u00e9.]]\nThe first phase of the basilica\u2019s construction involved architects Dalb\u00e9 Viau (1881- 1938) and Alphonse Venne (1875-1934) who had previously done work for the Congregation. From 1914 to 1916, Viau and Venne constructed the crypt church, with seating for 1000, which still stands today and forms the base of the basilica where the massive collection of stairs ends. Between 1924 and 1927, the crypt and building up until the roof were completed in the [[Renaissance Revival Architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style. Viau and Venne had wanted the dome of the Oratory to resemble that of [[St. Peter\u2019s Basilica]] in Rome and to be smaller than it actually is today, however they never had the chance to see those plans through as construction was halted with [[The Great Depression in Canada|the Great Depression]].\n\n===After the Great Depression===\nIn 1937, Dom [[Paul Bellot]] (1876-1944), born in France, was hired to work after the death of Venne, however he was required to work through Canadian [[Lucien Parent]] (1893-1956) due to not being a registered architect in Quebec.<ref>{{cite book |title='\"L'oratoire Saint-Joseph\" Montreal: son histoire, son architecture, vol.2, pp.235-244'|last=Pinard |first=Guy |publisher=Les Editions La Presse |year=1988}}</ref> He redesigned Viau and Venne's roof and dome entirely, making the dome significantly larger and modelling it to resemble the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]]. The construction of his large Oratory dome lasted four years and was completed in 1941 after involving thousands of workers.\n[[File:Architecture. St-Joseph Shrine BAnQ P48S1P01110.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the dome in 1937.]]\nFrom 1949\u20131951, architect Gilbert Moreau carried out alterations and improvements to the interior of Saint Joseph's Oratory, as well as to the adjacent monastery, and rearranged the sacristy in the basilica.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1866 | title=Moreau, Gilbert in Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800\u20131950 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is dedicated to Saint Joseph, to whom Brother Andr\u00e9 credited all his reported miracles. These were mostly related to some kind of healing power, and many pilgrims (handicapped, blind, ill, etc.) poured into his Basilica, including numerous non-Catholics. On display in the basilica is a wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the basilica and were purportedly healed. [[Pope John Paul II]] deemed the miracles to be authentic and [[beatification|beatified]] Brother Andr\u00e9 in 1982. In October 2010 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] canonized the saint.\n\nComposer [[\u00c9milien Allard]] was the church's [[carillonneur]] from 1955 to 1975. For [[RCA Victor]] he released the [[LP album]] ''Carols at the Carillon of Saint Joseph's Oratory'' for which he wrote the arrangements.<ref name=\"mort\">\"La vie et la mort d'un carillonneur\", ''Musique p\u00e9riodique'', vol 1, Jan\u2013Feb 1977</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nOn October 19, 2004, the Oratory held its centennial.

The image moved to the new modern basilica and was recrowned on 9 August 1955 via Cardinal [[Paul-\u00c9mile L\u00e9ger]] now located within its oil chapel department.\n\n==Architecture and structure==\n[[File:Montreal_StJoseph1_tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the crypt church, showing the barrel vaulting of its ceiling.]]\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Oratory Basilica Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the basilica, with its bright colours, stained glass and iconic multi-angled arches.]]\n[[File:St. Joseph's Oratory interior dome.jpg|thumb|right|The dome, as seen from the interior of the basilica.]]\nWhen the basilica\u2019s construction began in 1914, many architects were challenging the conventional [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[neoclassicism (architecture)|neoclassicism]]. This period was exactly around the time where [[expressionist architecture]], [[constructivist architecture]], [[Bauhaus]] ideas and many other facets of modern architecture began to take off, with pioneers like [[Le Corbusier]] in Europe and [[Frank Lloyd Wright ]]in the United States refusing to be categorized by traditional architectural styles. It was certainly atypical for monumental classical church buildings to be constructed in cities around this time, yet Saint Joseph's Oratory was one of the largest buildings in Montreal when it was constructed, and was designed in [[Renaissance Revival]] exterior with an [[Art Deco]] interior. The basilica, as it stands today, comprises many parts, including the ''Crypt Church'', located underneath the basilica, the ''Votive Chapel'', between the Crypt and the rock of Mount-Royal, the ''Shrine'', which encompasses the [[nave]], [[apse]] and [[transept]], and the ''dome'', which is the largest church dome in Canada and the third largest in the world.\n\n===Crypt Church===\nThe Crypt Church, originally designed by Viau and Venne, measures {{cvt|63.39 by 36.5 by 13.1|m}}, has a seating capacity of 1000 people and is designed in a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. The ceiling is supported using the [[barrel vault|barrel vaulting]] of steel-[[reinforced concrete]] arches. The church is called a \"crypt\" due to its flattened arches as well as its position embedded into the mountain underneath the basilica.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saint-joseph.org/en/ |title=\"Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal.\" L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph Du Mont-Royal |publisher=Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref> There is a statue of Joseph made out of [[Carrara marble]] behind the main altar of the Crypt Church, added in 1917 by the Italian artist A. Giacomini. Eight stained glass windows depicting the stages in [[Saint Joseph]]'s life were installed in the crypt in 1919 by the Montreal firm Perdriau et O'Shea.\n\n===Votive Chapel===\nAdded between 1946-1949 between the Crypt Church and the rock of Mount Royal, the Votive Chapel is designed in Art Deco style from the plans of [[Lucien Parent]], and relies on heavy use of geometric forms (square columns, square paneling on ceiling). The Chapel measures {{cvt|31.69 by 15.2 by 27.43|m}} and contains approximately 10,000 candles, with the central lampstand in front of the statue of Saint Joseph holding approximately 3500 votive candles. The chapel, also referred to as \"the Chapel of Ex-votos,\" has nearly 1000 [[Ex-voto|Ex-votos]] (canes, crutches, etc.) suspended within it, left behind by [[pilgrims]] during the life of Brother Andr\u00e9. The Chapel also contains eight [[bas-reliefs]] designed by Canadian sculptor, Joseph Guardo in 1948, which illustrate eight of the attributes which [[Christianity]] has accorded to Saint Joseph. The tomb of Saint Andr\u00e9, sculpted in [[black marble]], rests in an alcove in the middle of the Votive Chapel.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Shrine===\nThe interior of the basilica, known as the Shrine, was designed using concepts by Dom Bellot as well as Canadian architect G\u00e9rard Notebaert, and uses a Latin cross layout with a dome at the crossing. The interior has an overall length of {{cvt|105|m}}. The nave, which contains [[pews]] to seat 2028 people (with a maximum capacity of 10,000 people), measures {{cvt|37|m}} in width, while the transept measures {{convert|65|m}} and connects to the shrine of Brother Andr\u00e9. The apse, as well as the rest of the interior, is designed in [[Art Deco]] style, which was very popular in Montreal during the 1930s, and contains sculptures, [[bas-reliefs]], mosaics and stained glass of religious imagery. The roof of the basilica is held up using reinforced concrete multi-angle arches iconic of Dom Bellot\u2019s style.\n\nThe exterior of the Oratory is constructed using large blocks of granite from [[Lac M\u00e9gantic]] quarries in Quebec. The [[colonnade]] at the front fa\u00e7ade of the building consists of four {{cvt|18|m}}-tall, {{cvt|1.5|m}}-thick [[Corinthian columns]] which provide the structural support for the [[entablature]] of the front [[portico]]. It is also [[cornice (architecture)|corniced]] and [[ornament (art)|ornamented]]. The staircase which leads from the street to the base of the basilica contain two parallel flights of 283 concrete steps separated by a central flight of 99 wooden steps reserved for pilgrims who wish to climb on their knees.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Dome===\nThe dome of Saint Joseph\u2019s Oratory is the largest church dome in Canada and among the largest in the world, and this is a result of Dom Bellot\u2019s very inspired and ambitious designs. His plans for the dome are very similar to those of [[Florence Cathedral]], being of a \u201cdouble shell\u201d design, meaning it consists of two domes, one on the interior and one on the exterior with empty space in between. Like the cathedral in Florence, the outer dome of the Oratory consists of eight [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] laying atop an octagonal [[Tholobate|drum]], with a lantern and cross. The outer dome of the Oratory measures only {{cvt|17.78|cm}} in thickness and the inner dome measures only about {{cvt|12.7|cm}} in thickness, which is approximately 18 times thinner than the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The concrete shell of the Oratory's dome is so thin in fact that when related to its overall size, it is akin to an eggshell.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\"/> \n\nThe two domes vary immensely span and height, with the outer dome measuring {{cvt|39|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|97|m}} from the nave floor and the inner dome measuring {{cvt|26|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|60|m}} from the nave floor. There are 16 steel [[buttresses]] along the inner walls of the drums that provide the structural support for the dome. They serve to brace the inner dome against the outer dome, thus making the supporting walls for both domes more rigid.\n\n==Modern developments==\nIn 2018, the architectural firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49 won a competition to renovate the inside of the dome of Saint Joseph's Oratory and its observatory. The project is estimated to cost around $80 million CAD and will also include a complete renovation of the building's museum and the construction of a new welcome centre on Queen Mary road. The lantern will have space for up to 17 visitors at a time and will offer the only 360-degree view over the mountain in the city. As of 2019, renovations are underway.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of basilicas#Canada|List of basilicas in Canada]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount-Royal}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.saint-joseph.org}}\n*[http://www.cccb.ca/site/frc/eglise-au-canada-et-ailleurs/leglise-catholique-au-canada/principaux-sanctuaires-au-canada Saint Joseph's Oratory - Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]\n* [http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/religion-spirituality/the-miracle-on-mount-royal-st-josephs-oratory/topic---the-miracle-on-mount-royal-100-years-of-st-josephs-oratory.html CBC Digital Archives - ''The Miracle on Mount Royal: 100 Years of St. Joseph's Oratory'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708124406/http://www.catholicphotographer.com/Quebec-Pilgrimage/St-Joseph-Oratory-Montreal-Aug/13235948_Zvx7J#961144593_xtopA Saint Joseph's Oratory: Photo Gallery by The Catholic Photographer]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=gXdbEFLUsygC&lpg=PA450&dq=Lucien%20Parent%20architect&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=Lucien%20Parent%20architect&f=false/] Les Merveilles de L'Oratoire: L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal, 1904\u20132004 By Denise Robillard\n* [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/saint-josephs-oratory/ Saint Joseph's Oratory in ''Canadian Encyclopedia'']\n\n{{Montreal landmarks}}\n{{Basilicas in Canada}}\n{{NHSC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Josephs Oratory}}\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1967|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Basilica churches in Montreal|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches in Montreal|J]]\n[[Category:Catholic pilgrimage sites|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Church buildings with domes]]\n[[Category:National Historic Sites in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Mount Royal]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic national shrines in Canada|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:20th-century Roman Catholic church buildings|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:C\u00f4te-des-Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches on the National Historic Sites of Canada register|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Saint Joseph (husband of Mary)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox religious building\n|building_name         = Saint Joseph's Oratory<br />{{small|Oratoire Saint-Joseph}}\n|image                 = Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal - Montreal.jpg\n|image_size            = 300px\n|location              = 3800, chemin Queen Mary<br />[[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada\n|coordinates           = {{coord|45.491667|N|73.616667|W|type:landmark_region:CA-QC|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|religious_affiliation = [[Roman Catholic]]\n|district              = [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal|Archdiocese of Montreal]]\n|status                = [[Minor basilica]]\n|map_type              = Montreal\n|leadership            = Father Claude Grou\n|website               = {{url|http://www.saint-joseph.org}}\n|architecture_type     = [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]], domed [[basilica]]\n|architecture_style    = [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe#Renaissance|Italian renaissance]]\n|facade_direction      = NNW\n|year_completed        = 1967\n|architect             = Dalb\u00e9 Viau, Alphonse Venne, [[Lucien Parent]] and [[Dom Paul Bellot]]\n|capacity              = 10,000 / 2,400 sitting\n|length                = {{convert|105|m|ft}}\n|width                 = {{convert|65|m|ft}}\n|width_nave            = {{convert|37|m|ft}}\n|height_max            = {{convert|129|m|ft}}\n|dome_quantity         = 1 (double shell design)\n|dome_height_outer     = {{convert|97|m|ft}} (from nave floor)\n|dome_height_inner     = {{convert|60|m|ft}} (from nave floor)\n|dome_dia_outer        = {{convert|39|m|ft}}\n|dome_dia_inner        = {{convert|26|m|ft}}\n|materials             = Canadian [[granite]], [[copper]]\n|embedded              = \n|designation1          = National Historic Site of Canada\n|designation1_offname  = Saint Joseph\u2019s Oratory of Mount Royal National Historic Site of Canada\n|designation1_date     = 2004\n}}\n\n'''Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal''' ({{lang-fr|Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[minor basilica]] and [[National Shrine|national shrine]] located at 3800 [[Queen Mary Road (Montreal)|Queen Mary Road]] on [[Mount Royal]]'s [[Westmount Summit]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].

Due to his reputation, in 1904 he was given funding to construct a small chapel on Mount-Royal across from [[Coll\u00e8ge Notre-Dame du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur|Notre Dame College]]<ref name=\"Pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>  to operate out of. The small, [[Gothic Revival Architecture|Gothic Revival]] style chapel expanded four times over the next decade with the growing of Brother Andr\u00e9's fame and the Congregation decided to fulfill his request to build a [[basilica]] in his patron saint, [[Saint Joseph]]'s honor. The original chapel, measuring 4.5 meters by 5.5 meters still stands today, though it has since been relocated about a hundred meters away to make room for the massive basilica that stands today.\n[[File:Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette.jpg|thumb||left|[[Andr\u00e9 Bessette]], [[Congregation of Holy Cross|C.S.C.]], commonly known as Brother Andr\u00e9.]]\nThe first phase of the basilica\u2019s construction involved architects Dalb\u00e9 Viau (1881- 1938) and Alphonse Venne (1875-1934) who had previously done work for the Congregation. From 1914 to 1916, Viau and Venne constructed the crypt church, with seating for 1000, which still stands today and forms the base of the basilica where the massive collection of stairs ends. Between 1924 and 1927, the crypt and building up until the roof were completed in the [[Renaissance Revival Architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style. Viau and Venne had wanted the dome of the Oratory to resemble that of [[St. Peter\u2019s Basilica]] in Rome and to be smaller than it actually is today, however they never had the chance to see those plans through as construction was halted with [[The Great Depression in Canada|the Great Depression]].\n\n===After the Great Depression===\nIn 1937, Dom [[Paul Bellot]] (1876-1944), born in France, was hired to work after the death of Venne, however he was required to work through Canadian [[Lucien Parent]] (1893-1956) due to not being a registered architect in Quebec.<ref>{{cite book |title='\"L'oratoire Saint-Joseph\" Montreal: son histoire, son architecture, vol.2, pp.235-244'|last=Pinard |first=Guy |publisher=Les Editions La Presse |year=1988}}</ref> He redesigned Viau and Venne's roof and dome entirely, making the dome significantly larger and modelling it to resemble the dome of [[Florence Cathedral]].

These were mostly related to some kind of healing power, and many pilgrims (handicapped, blind, ill, etc.) poured into his Basilica, including numerous non-Catholics. On display in the basilica is a wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the basilica and were purportedly healed. [[Pope John Paul II]] deemed the miracles to be authentic and [[beatification|beatified]] Brother Andr\u00e9 in 1982.

The image moved to the new modern basilica and was recrowned on 9 August 1955 via Cardinal [[Paul-\u00c9mile L\u00e9ger]] now located within its oil chapel department.\n\n==Architecture and structure==\n[[File:Montreal_StJoseph1_tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the crypt church, showing the barrel vaulting of its ceiling.]]\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Oratory Basilica Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the basilica, with its bright colours, stained glass and iconic multi-angled arches.]]\n[[File:St. Joseph's Oratory interior dome.jpg|thumb|right|The dome, as seen from the interior of the basilica.]]\nWhen the basilica\u2019s construction began in 1914, many architects were challenging the conventional [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[neoclassicism (architecture)|neoclassicism]]. This period was exactly around the time where [[expressionist architecture]], [[constructivist architecture]], [[Bauhaus]] ideas and many other facets of modern architecture began to take off, with pioneers like [[Le Corbusier]] in Europe and [[Frank Lloyd Wright ]]in the United States refusing to be categorized by traditional architectural styles. It was certainly atypical for monumental classical church buildings to be constructed in cities around this time, yet Saint Joseph's Oratory was one of the largest buildings in Montreal when it was constructed, and was designed in [[Renaissance Revival]] exterior with an [[Art Deco]] interior. The basilica, as it stands today, comprises many parts, including the ''Crypt Church'', located underneath the basilica, the ''Votive Chapel'', between the Crypt and the rock of Mount-Royal, the ''Shrine'', which encompasses the [[nave]], [[apse]] and [[transept]], and the ''dome'', which is the largest church dome in Canada and the third largest in the world.\n\n===Crypt Church===\nThe Crypt Church, originally designed by Viau and Venne, measures {{cvt|63.39 by 36.5 by 13.1|m}}, has a seating capacity of 1000 people and is designed in a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. The ceiling is supported using the [[barrel vault|barrel vaulting]] of steel-[[reinforced concrete]] arches. The church is called a \"crypt\" due to its flattened arches as well as its position embedded into the mountain underneath the basilica.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saint-joseph.org/en/ |title=\"Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal.\" L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph Du Mont-Royal |publisher=Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix |accessdate=2 January 2020}}</ref> There is a statue of Joseph made out of [[Carrara marble]] behind the main altar of the Crypt Church, added in 1917 by the Italian artist A. Giacomini. Eight stained glass windows depicting the stages in [[Saint Joseph]]'s life were installed in the crypt in 1919 by the Montreal firm Perdriau et O'Shea.\n\n===Votive Chapel===\nAdded between 1946-1949 between the Crypt Church and the rock of Mount Royal, the Votive Chapel is designed in Art Deco style from the plans of [[Lucien Parent]], and relies on heavy use of geometric forms (square columns, square paneling on ceiling). The Chapel measures {{cvt|31.69 by 15.2 by 27.43|m}} and contains approximately 10,000 candles, with the central lampstand in front of the statue of Saint Joseph holding approximately 3500 votive candles. The chapel, also referred to as \"the Chapel of Ex-votos,\" has nearly 1000 [[Ex-voto|Ex-votos]] (canes, crutches, etc.) suspended within it, left behind by [[pilgrims]] during the life of Brother Andr\u00e9. The Chapel also contains eight [[bas-reliefs]] designed by Canadian sculptor, Joseph Guardo in 1948, which illustrate eight of the attributes which [[Christianity]] has accorded to Saint Joseph. The tomb of Saint Andr\u00e9, sculpted in [[black marble]], rests in an alcove in the middle of the Votive Chapel.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Shrine===\nThe interior of the basilica, known as the Shrine, was designed using concepts by Dom Bellot as well as Canadian architect G\u00e9rard Notebaert, and uses a Latin cross layout with a dome at the crossing. The interior has an overall length of {{cvt|105|m}}. The nave, which contains [[pews]] to seat 2028 people (with a maximum capacity of 10,000 people), measures {{cvt|37|m}} in width, while the transept measures {{convert|65|m}} and connects to the shrine of Brother Andr\u00e9. The apse, as well as the rest of the interior, is designed in [[Art Deco]] style, which was very popular in Montreal during the 1930s, and contains sculptures, [[bas-reliefs]], mosaics and stained glass of religious imagery. The roof of the basilica is held up using reinforced concrete multi-angle arches iconic of Dom Bellot\u2019s style.\n\nThe exterior of the Oratory is constructed using large blocks of granite from [[Lac M\u00e9gantic]] quarries in Quebec. The [[colonnade]] at the front fa\u00e7ade of the building consists of four {{cvt|18|m}}-tall, {{cvt|1.5|m}}-thick [[Corinthian columns]] which provide the structural support for the [[entablature]] of the front [[portico]]. It is also [[cornice (architecture)|corniced]] and [[ornament (art)|ornamented]]. The staircase which leads from the street to the base of the basilica contain two parallel flights of 283 concrete steps separated by a central flight of 99 wooden steps reserved for pilgrims who wish to climb on their knees.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\" />\n\n===Dome===\nThe dome of Saint Joseph\u2019s Oratory is the largest church dome in Canada and among the largest in the world, and this is a result of Dom Bellot\u2019s very inspired and ambitious designs. His plans for the dome are very similar to those of [[Florence Cathedral]], being of a \u201cdouble shell\u201d design, meaning it consists of two domes, one on the interior and one on the exterior with empty space in between. Like the cathedral in Florence, the outer dome of the Oratory consists of eight [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] laying atop an octagonal [[Tholobate|drum]], with a lantern and cross. The outer dome of the Oratory measures only {{cvt|17.78|cm}} in thickness and the inner dome measures only about {{cvt|12.7|cm}} in thickness, which is approximately 18 times thinner than the dome of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The concrete shell of the Oratory's dome is so thin in fact that when related to its overall size, it is akin to an eggshell.<ref name=\"Congr\u00e9gation De Sainte-Croix\"/> \n\nThe two domes vary immensely span and height, with the outer dome measuring {{cvt|39|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|97|m}} from the nave floor and the inner dome measuring {{cvt|26|m}} in diameter and rising {{cvt|60|m}} from the nave floor. There are 16 steel [[buttresses]] along the inner walls of the drums that provide the structural support for the dome. They serve to brace the inner dome against the outer dome, thus making the supporting walls for both domes more rigid.\n\n==Modern developments==\nIn 2018, the architectural firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49 won a competition to renovate the inside of the dome of Saint Joseph's Oratory and its observatory. The project is estimated to cost around $80 million CAD and will also include a complete renovation of the building's museum and the construction of a new welcome centre on Queen Mary road. The lantern will have space for up to 17 visitors at a time and will offer the only 360-degree view over the mountain in the city. As of 2019, renovations are underway.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of basilicas#Canada|List of basilicas in Canada]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount-Royal}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.saint-joseph.org}}\n*[http://www.cccb.ca/site/frc/eglise-au-canada-et-ailleurs/leglise-catholique-au-canada/principaux-sanctuaires-au-canada Saint Joseph's Oratory - Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]\n* [http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/religion-spirituality/the-miracle-on-mount-royal-st-josephs-oratory/topic---the-miracle-on-mount-royal-100-years-of-st-josephs-oratory.html CBC Digital Archives - ''The Miracle on Mount Royal: 100 Years of St. Joseph's Oratory'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708124406/http://www.catholicphotographer.com/Quebec-Pilgrimage/St-Joseph-Oratory-Montreal-Aug/13235948_Zvx7J#961144593_xtopA Saint Joseph's Oratory: Photo Gallery by The Catholic Photographer]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=gXdbEFLUsygC&lpg=PA450&dq=Lucien%20Parent%20architect&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=Lucien%20Parent%20architect&f=false/] Les Merveilles de L'Oratoire: L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal, 1904\u20132004 By Denise Robillard\n* [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/saint-josephs-oratory/ Saint Joseph's Oratory in ''Canadian Encyclopedia'']\n\n{{Montreal landmarks}}\n{{Basilicas in Canada}}\n{{NHSC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Josephs Oratory}}\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1967|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Basilica churches in Montreal|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches in Montreal|J]]\n[[Category:Catholic pilgrimage sites|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Church buildings with domes]]\n[[Category:National Historic Sites in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Mount Royal]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic national shrines in Canada|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:20th-century Roman Catholic church buildings|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:C\u00f4te-des-Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches on the National Historic Sites of Canada register|Joseph's Oratory]]\n[[Category:Saint Joseph (husband of Mary)]]\n", "name_user": "Jonahrapp", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph%27s_Oratory"}

The three true legs and midabdominal true legs are all bright orange.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Shelter building====\nAll larval instars of ''E. clarus'' build shelters on their host plant. They build about 5 shelters throughout larval growth and development in 4 distinct styles, which are constructed from instinct and unique to larval size. The first, second, and third instars make a simpler, invariant structure that requires 2 incisions in the leaf and silk to fold over the flap created. Shelters are typically built on the apical portion of the leaflet. One study of ''E. clarus'' larvae in the Washington D.C. area defined 5 steps of shelter building:<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Martha R.|last2=Lind|first2=Eric M.|last3=Jones|first3=Meg T.|last4=Long|first4=Jeremy D.|last5=Maupin|first5=Jennifer L.|date=2003-07-01|title=Uniformity of Leaf Shelter Construction by Larvae of Epargyreus clarus (Hesperiidae), the Silver-Spotted Skipper|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=465\u2013480|doi=10.1023/A:1027399122333|issn=0892-7553}}</ref>\n# ''Site selection'': Larvae traverse across the entire leaf, following major veins and swinging their heads to create a single silk trail. \n# Silk template: A thick, visible mat of silk outlines the intended incisions and ultimately becomes the ceiling of the leaf house. The larvae keep their posterior end on the template at all times.\n# ''First cut'': The first cut follows the silk template on the perimeter nearest the leaf apex. The larvae often interrupt chewing cuts in order to deposit silk at the terminus. The first cut is completed in about 6-7 segments. At the end, the larva makes a U-turn motion so that its position relative to the leaf surface and template margins remains the same while facing the opposite direction.\n# ''Second cut and notch'': The second cut follows the silk template on the edge closest to the base of the leaflet and is completed in about 2 to 4 segments. The first segment curves inwards, is made in a single effort, and is about 75% the length of the first cut. The next segment is adjacent to the initial segment and continues past the length of the first cut. The juncture between the two segments creates a notch.\n# ''Folding and securing'': The uncut area between the first and second incisions composes the hinge. The hinge length tends to correspond to larval body length. The larva lay silk strands along this area, parallel to the cut termini. As the strands contract, the notch creates a pinch and the leaf flap is pulled over the leaflet plane. The pinch then becomes the peak of the roof and the larva begins to make \u201cguy-wires\u201d that attach the edge of the flap to the leaflet surface.\nLarvae take breaks of about 30 minutes between each cut and fold. It typically takes less than 2 and a half hours to complete shelter construction. Larvae spend about 95% of their time resting on the ceiling of the shelter.<ref name=\":3\" />[[File:Pinned E. clarus.jpg|thumb|right|Adult]]First instar shelters are typically fasted by only about 2-4 \u201cguy-wires.\u201d In addition, older caterpillars occasionally live in a nest of made of multiple leaves connected by silk, especially when using host plants with smaller leaflets. For example, first, second, and third instars can make shelters with one ''Robinia'' leaflet, but the fourth and fifth instars have to use 2 to 4 or 5 leaflets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Pupa ===\nLarvae pupate throughout the winter. The pupa is dark brown with black and white marks. There are three or more overlapping generations of hibernating pupa in Florida \u2013 fewer in the northern regions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Adult ===\nThe adult wingspan ranges from 1.75 to 2.625 inches (4.5 to 6.7&nbsp;cm).

They build about 5 shelters throughout larval growth and development in 4 distinct styles, which are constructed from instinct and unique to larval size. The first, second, and third instars make a simpler, invariant structure that requires 2 incisions in the leaf and silk to fold over the flap created. Shelters are typically built on the apical portion of the leaflet. One study of ''E. clarus'' larvae in the Washington D.C. area defined 5 steps of shelter building:<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Martha R.|last2=Lind|first2=Eric M.|last3=Jones|first3=Meg T.|last4=Long|first4=Jeremy D.|last5=Maupin|first5=Jennifer L.|date=2003-07-01|title=Uniformity of Leaf Shelter Construction by Larvae of Epargyreus clarus (Hesperiidae), the Silver-Spotted Skipper|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=465\u2013480|doi=10.1023/A:1027399122333|issn=0892-7553}}</ref>\n# ''Site selection'': Larvae traverse across the entire leaf, following major veins and swinging their heads to create a single silk trail. \n# Silk template: A thick, visible mat of silk outlines the intended incisions and ultimately becomes the ceiling of the leaf house. The larvae keep their posterior end on the template at all times.\n# ''First cut'': The first cut follows the silk template on the perimeter nearest the leaf apex. The larvae often interrupt chewing cuts in order to deposit silk at the terminus. The first cut is completed in about 6-7 segments. At the end, the larva makes a U-turn motion so that its position relative to the leaf surface and template margins remains the same while facing the opposite direction.\n# ''Second cut and notch'': The second cut follows the silk template on the edge closest to the base of the leaflet and is completed in about 2 to 4 segments. The first segment curves inwards, is made in a single effort, and is about 75% the length of the first cut. The next segment is adjacent to the initial segment and continues past the length of the first cut. The juncture between the two segments creates a notch.\n# ''Folding and securing'': The uncut area between the first and second incisions composes the hinge. The hinge length tends to correspond to larval body length. The larva lay silk strands along this area, parallel to the cut termini. As the strands contract, the notch creates a pinch and the leaf flap is pulled over the leaflet plane. The pinch then becomes the peak of the roof and the larva begins to make \u201cguy-wires\u201d that attach the edge of the flap to the leaflet surface.\nLarvae take breaks of about 30 minutes between each cut and fold. It typically takes less than 2 and a half hours to complete shelter construction. Larvae spend about 95% of their time resting on the ceiling of the shelter.<ref name=\":3\" />[[File:Pinned E. clarus.jpg|thumb|right|Adult]]First instar shelters are typically fasted by only about 2-4 \u201cguy-wires.\u201d In addition, older caterpillars occasionally live in a nest of made of multiple leaves connected by silk, especially when using host plants with smaller leaflets.
