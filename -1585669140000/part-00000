The station is owned by [[Gray Television]]. KOLN's studios are located on North 40th Street in Lincoln, and its transmitter is located southeast of [[Goehner, Nebraska|Goehner]]. \n\n'''KGIN''' (virtual and VHF digital channel 11) in [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]] operates as a [[broadcast relay station#Semi-satellites|semi-satellite]] of KOLN, serving the central portion of the [[media market|market]]; this station maintains a [[news bureau]] and sales office on West State Street in Grand Island and transmitter facilities near [[Heartwell, Nebraska]]. Collectively branded as '''\"10/11\"''', the two stations serve one of the largest coverage areas in the United States, stretching across 42 counties in southern and central Nebraska\u2014almost two-thirds of the state's geographical land area\u2014and an additional four counties in [[Kansas]].\n\nKOLN/KGIN operates as part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[Superior, Nebraska|Superior]]-licensed [[NBC]] affiliate [[KSNB-TV]] (channel 4), which was acquired by Gray in 2013 and [[simulcast]]s in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on the second [[digital subchannel]] of KOLN/KGIN. It previously broadcast [[MyNetworkTV]] and [[MeTV]] programming, along with central Nebraska-specific newscasts. Following Gray's acquisition of [[Hastings, Nebraska|Hastings]]' NBC affiliate KHAS-TV, the station was shut down and its programming (along with separately-produced newscasts out of Hastings) was moved to KSNB's primary channel, which became the primary NBC affiliate for this vast market. KSNB moved to KHAS' former studio just outside Hastings on [[U.S. Route 281|US 281]], though [[master control]] and some internal operations are based at KOLN's facilities. Since KSNB's signal is spotty in Lincoln itself, KOLN and KGIN continue to simulcast it on their second subchannel, while MyNetworkTV and MeTV programming moved to KOLN and KGIN's third subchannel. Gray reacquired [[KNHL]] (the former KHAS-TV) from Legacy Broadcasting on March 1, 2019, and made it a KSNB satellite to further resolve its signal issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-19-72A1.pdf|title=Letter|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=February 12, 2019|accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>  KOLN/KGIN is also [[sister station|sister]] to Lincoln-licensed low-power station [[KCWH-LD]] (channel 18), a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate (through [[The CW Plus]]) that served as a translator for KSNB prior to 2018.\n\n'''[[KNPL-LD]]''' (channel 10) in [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]] operates as an another semi-satellite of KOLN. KOLN serves as a master hub for Gray's Nebraska television stations, with the exception of NBC affiliate [[WOWT]] (channel 6) in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].\n\n==History==\nKOLN-TV signed on for the first time on February 18, 1953, on channel 12 as Nebraska's third television station and the first outside [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]. It was owned by Cornhusker Radio and Television Corporation along with KOLN radio (1400 AM; now [[KLIN]]). In August 1953, it was purchased by broadcasting pioneer [[John Fetzer]].<ref name=\"fetzer-buy\">{{cite web|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1954/1954-02-22-BC.pdf| title=Fetzer Pays $300,000 For KFOR-TV Lincoln |last=|first=|work=Broadcasting-Telecasting|date=February 22, 1954|page=66| accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> In February 1954, Fetzer purchased Lincoln's other TV station, [[KFOR-TV (defunct)|KFOR-TV]], channel 10, which had launched a few months after KOLN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1011now.com/history |title=10/11 Station History |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603054302/http://www.1011now.com/history |archivedate=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 2, 2016 }}</ref> To avoid running afoul of FCC ownership regulations (and to create a commercial broadcast monopoly for himself in the Lincoln market<ref name=\"fetzer-monopoly\">{{cite web|url=https://huskeralum.org/alumni-stories/-/asset_publisher/ERkkhz8DM30I/content/alumni-profile-jack-mcbride| title=50 Years of Service NET | last=McGuire| first=Jana| work=Nebraska Alumni Magazine|date = Fall 2004 | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref>), Fetzer moved KOLN to channel 10 and donated the channel 12 facilities and the KFOR license to the [[University of Nebraska]] for its [[non-commercial educational|educational station]], [[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications|KUON-TV]].<ref name=\"kfor\">{{cite video|url=http://nebraskastudies.org/0900/stories/0901_0104_01.html|title=TV Comes to Lincoln, Nebraska|last=Ganzel|first=Bill|work=NebraskaStudies.org|accessdate=March 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908080817/http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0900/stories/0901_0104_01.html|archive-date=2007-09-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the same time, Fetzer obtained FCC permission to boost KOLN's visual [[effective radiated power]] to the then-maximum 316 [[kilowatt|kW]],<ref name=\"fetzer-buy\" /> to be broadcast from a new {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} tower {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of Lincoln.

It picked up the ABC affiliation from KFOR-TV after Fetzer shut down that station in March 1954. Meanwhile, Fetzer persuaded the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to merge Lincoln with the Hastings\u2013[[Kearney, Nebraska|Kearney]] market in central Nebraska. Lincoln has long been the cultural center for central Nebraska, and Fetzer felt that Lincoln had more in common with this area than Omaha. He also wanted an affiliation with a stronger network. Although Fetzer had a very good relationship with CBS, there was little prospect of taking the CBS affiliation from Omaha's [[KMTV]].\n\nSoon after the FCC made Lincoln the center of the new Lincoln\u2013Hastings\u2013Kearney market, KOLN became a primary CBS affiliate. Omaha wouldn't have a primary ABC affiliate again until [[KETV]] signed on in 1957. DuMont shut down in 1956, and KOLN dropped the remaining ABC shows from the schedule in 1957. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the [[NTA Film Network]].<ref name=\"Boxoffice7\">{{Cite journal|title=Require Prime Evening Time for NTA Films |journal=Boxoffice |page=13 |date=November 10, 1956 |url=http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614204506/http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1 |archivedate=June 14, 2009 }}</ref> Along with its more powerful broadcasting signal, KOLN signed on translator after translator across its vast and mostly rural coverage area over the next few years, cementing a dominance that continues to this day.\n\nKGIN-TV debuted on October 1, 1961, as a satellite of KOLN; since then, the two stations have been known on-air as \"10/11.\" During the 1960s, KOLN/KGIN frequently broadcast games of the [[Detroit Tigers]], which Fetzer had bought in 1956.\n\nFetzer began selling off his stations in the 1980s. KOLN/KGIN was among the last to be sold, going to [[George N. Gillett Jr.|Gillett Communications]] in 1984. Gillett sold the pair to Busse Broadcasting in 1987 to make room for Gillett's acquisition of the [[Storer Broadcasting]] stations. Busse merged with current owner Gray Communications, now Gray Television, in 1998.\n\nFrom KFOR-TV's shutdown in March 1954 until [[KLKN]] signed on in 1996, KOLN was the only commercial station in Lincoln, making it one of the largest cities in the country with only one full-power commercial station. The western half of the market had full network service; it was served by KGIN, ABC affiliate [[KHGI-TV]] and NBC affiliate KHAS-TV. Later, future sister station KSNB-TV broke off from NTV and joined with Grand Island-based [[KTVG-TV]] to become the Fox affiliate for the western half of the market. This resulted in a market that had very little basis in television reality; KOLN/KGIN was the only major-network station shared by the entire market (though KTVG/KSNB added a translator in Lincoln). It was only truly realized when [[direct-broadcast satellite]] gained more penetration at the turn of the century.\n\nDespite being the only station in the market, KOLN had no need to air other networks' programming. Most of the Omaha stations provide at least secondary coverage of Lincoln. Until KMTV and WOWT were dropped at the turn of the millennium, most of them were also available on cable.\n\nFor a time in January 2009, the KOLN/KGIN website included a section about a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate on its second digital subchannel (then used for MyNetworkTV, which was to have moved to a DT3 subcarrier). However, station officials later said there were no immediate plans to launch such a station, describing the page as part of an experimental project not meant for public consumption.<ref name=\"js-kolnnofox\">{{cite news|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2009/01/21/living/gz/video_games/doc4977a2b0e1898215560118.txt|title=KOLN/KGIN-TV explains mysterious \"Fox 10/11' Web sighting|last=Korbelik|first=Jeff|date=January 21, 2009|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|accessdate=January 23, 2009}}</ref> At that time, Fox programming was seen on KSNB-TV (now a sister station to KOLN/KGIN) and [[KTVG-TV]] (channel 17). Although the station refused to rule out launching a digital Fox station in the future, this was rendered moot when then-CW affiliate KCWL-TV relaunched as Fox affiliate KFXL-TV.\n\nThe \"10/11\" brand is so well established in Nebraska that when Gray brought KSNB back on the air in 2012, it initially did so under the branding \"10/11 Central Nebraska.\" Likewise, when it relaunched its longtime translator in [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]] as locally-focused CBS affiliate [[KNPL-LD]], it used the branding \"10/11 North Platte.\"\n\n===KOLN tower collapse===\nOn January 18, 2020, KOLN's transmitter tower near [[Beaver Crossing, Nebraska|Beaver Crossing]] collapsed due to an [[ice storm]].

''My News at 9'' only airs on weekdays at 9 p.m. It is produced and aired in high definition. In June 2014, the MyNetworkTV and MeTV programming was moved to a second subchannel of KSNB, with KSNB's main channel and the KOLN/KGIN subchannels now airing the programming previously seen on KHAS-TV; this includes NBC programming and KHAS-TV's separate Hastings-based news operation, giving Lincoln its first-ever NBC affiliate.<ref name=koln-ksnbnbc>{{cite news|title=KHAS 5.1 Signal Moving to KSNB 4.1|url=http://www.1011now.com/home/headlines/KHAS-51-Signal-Moving-262902001.html|accessdate=June 12, 2014|work=1011now.com|date=June 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615013016/http://www.1011now.com/home/headlines/KHAS-51-Signal-Moving-262902001.html|archive-date=June 15, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=ljs-ksnbnbc>{{cite news|last1=Korbelik|first1=Jeff|title=KSNB-TV to become an NBC affiliate|url=http://journalstar.com/entertainment/tv-radio/ksnb-tv-to-become-an-nbc-affiliate/article_c6b256a4-5b9b-5574-a3e9-fef365c2abb0.html|accessdate=June 12, 2014|work=[[Lincoln Journal-Star]]|date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> With the purchase of [[KNOP-TV]], Gray merged KOLN/KGIN, KSNB and KNOP to form the Nebraska News & Weather Networks.

The three stations can also cover each other's newscasts. Weather on weekends for KSNB is broadcast from their Lincoln studios in a second green screen facility since KOLN is also on air at the same time, and the same is done for KNOP during the weekday evening newscasts. Many news stories are shared between the stations. The result is that essentially for the first time, there is news from the majority of the coverage areas in almost every newscast.\n\n===Analog-to-digital conversion===\nKOLN aired its digital programming on channel 25, while KGIN aired digital programming on channel 32.

Not only was it the only major-network affiliate shared by the entire market for most of the second half of the 20th century, but it was the only commercial station in Lincoln for 40 years.\n\nWell into the 1980s, when nearly every other local television news broadcast began with the latest news, KOLN began its newscasts with the weather report as a service to its mostly rural audience. A.

channel|virtual]] and [[very high frequency|VHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 10, is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], United States. The station is owned by [[Gray Television]]. KOLN's studios are located on North 40th Street in Lincoln, and its transmitter is located southeast of [[Goehner, Nebraska|Goehner]]. \n\n'''KGIN''' (virtual and VHF digital channel 11) in [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]] operates as a [[broadcast relay station#Semi-satellites|semi-satellite]] of KOLN, serving the central portion of the [[media market|market]]; this station maintains a [[news bureau]] and sales office on West State Street in Grand Island and transmitter facilities near [[Heartwell, Nebraska]]. Collectively branded as '''\"10/11\"''', the two stations serve one of the largest coverage areas in the United States, stretching across 42 counties in southern and central Nebraska\u2014almost two-thirds of the state's geographical land area\u2014and an additional four counties in [[Kansas]].\n\nKOLN/KGIN operates as part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[Superior, Nebraska|Superior]]-licensed [[NBC]] affiliate [[KSNB-TV]] (channel 4), which was acquired by Gray in 2013 and [[simulcast]]s in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on the second [[digital subchannel]] of KOLN/KGIN. It previously broadcast [[MyNetworkTV]] and [[MeTV]] programming, along with central Nebraska-specific newscasts. Following Gray's acquisition of [[Hastings, Nebraska|Hastings]]' NBC affiliate KHAS-TV, the station was shut down and its programming (along with separately-produced newscasts out of Hastings) was moved to KSNB's primary channel, which became the primary NBC affiliate for this vast market. KSNB moved to KHAS' former studio just outside Hastings on [[U.S. Route 281|US 281]], though [[master control]] and some internal operations are based at KOLN's facilities. Since KSNB's signal is spotty in Lincoln itself, KOLN and KGIN continue to simulcast it on their second subchannel, while MyNetworkTV and MeTV programming moved to KOLN and KGIN's third subchannel. Gray reacquired [[KNHL]] (the former KHAS-TV) from Legacy Broadcasting on March 1, 2019, and made it a KSNB satellite to further resolve its signal issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-19-72A1.pdf|title=Letter|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=February 12, 2019|accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>  KOLN/KGIN is also [[sister station|sister]] to Lincoln-licensed low-power station [[KCWH-LD]] (channel 18), a [[The CW|CW]] affiliate (through [[The CW Plus]]) that served as a translator for KSNB prior to 2018.\n\n'''[[KNPL-LD]]''' (channel 10) in [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]] operates as an another semi-satellite of KOLN. KOLN serves as a master hub for Gray's Nebraska television stations, with the exception of NBC affiliate [[WOWT]] (channel 6) in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].\n\n==History==\nKOLN-TV signed on for the first time on February 18, 1953, on channel 12 as Nebraska's third television station and the first outside [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]. It was owned by Cornhusker Radio and Television Corporation along with KOLN radio (1400 AM; now [[KLIN]]). In August 1953, it was purchased by broadcasting pioneer [[John Fetzer]].<ref name=\"fetzer-buy\">{{cite web|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1954/1954-02-22-BC.pdf| title=Fetzer Pays $300,000 For KFOR-TV Lincoln |last=|first=|work=Broadcasting-Telecasting|date=February 22, 1954|page=66| accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> In February 1954, Fetzer purchased Lincoln's other TV station, [[KFOR-TV (defunct)|KFOR-TV]], channel 10, which had launched a few months after KOLN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1011now.com/history |title=10/11 Station History |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603054302/http://www.1011now.com/history |archivedate=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 2, 2016 }}</ref> To avoid running afoul of FCC ownership regulations (and to create a commercial broadcast monopoly for himself in the Lincoln market<ref name=\"fetzer-monopoly\">{{cite web|url=https://huskeralum.org/alumni-stories/-/asset_publisher/ERkkhz8DM30I/content/alumni-profile-jack-mcbride| title=50 Years of Service NET | last=McGuire| first=Jana| work=Nebraska Alumni Magazine|date = Fall 2004 | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref>), Fetzer moved KOLN to channel 10 and donated the channel 12 facilities and the KFOR license to the [[University of Nebraska]] for its [[non-commercial educational|educational station]], [[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications|KUON-TV]].<ref name=\"kfor\">{{cite video|url=http://nebraskastudies.org/0900/stories/0901_0104_01.html|title=TV Comes to Lincoln, Nebraska|last=Ganzel|first=Bill|work=NebraskaStudies.org|accessdate=March 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908080817/http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0900/stories/0901_0104_01.html|archive-date=2007-09-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the same time, Fetzer obtained FCC permission to boost KOLN's visual [[effective radiated power]] to the then-maximum 316 [[kilowatt|kW]],<ref name=\"fetzer-buy\" /> to be broadcast from a new {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} tower {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of Lincoln.

It picked up the ABC affiliation from KFOR-TV after Fetzer shut down that station in March 1954. Meanwhile, Fetzer persuaded the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to merge Lincoln with the Hastings\u2013[[Kearney, Nebraska|Kearney]] market in central Nebraska. Lincoln has long been the cultural center for central Nebraska, and Fetzer felt that Lincoln had more in common with this area than Omaha. He also wanted an affiliation with a stronger network. Although Fetzer had a very good relationship with CBS, there was little prospect of taking the CBS affiliation from Omaha's [[KMTV]].\n\nSoon after the FCC made Lincoln the center of the new Lincoln\u2013Hastings\u2013Kearney market, KOLN became a primary CBS affiliate. Omaha wouldn't have a primary ABC affiliate again until [[KETV]] signed on in 1957. DuMont shut down in 1956, and KOLN dropped the remaining ABC shows from the schedule in 1957. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the [[NTA Film Network]].<ref name=\"Boxoffice7\">{{Cite journal|title=Require Prime Evening Time for NTA Films |journal=Boxoffice |page=13 |date=November 10, 1956 |url=http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614204506/http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1 |archivedate=June 14, 2009 }}</ref> Along with its more powerful broadcasting signal, KOLN signed on translator after translator across its vast and mostly rural coverage area over the next few years, cementing a dominance that continues to this day.\n\nKGIN-TV debuted on October 1, 1961, as a satellite of KOLN; since then, the two stations have been known on-air as \"10/11.\" During the 1960s, KOLN/KGIN frequently broadcast games of the [[Detroit Tigers]], which Fetzer had bought in 1956.\n\nFetzer began selling off his stations in the 1980s. KOLN/KGIN was among the last to be sold, going to [[George N. Gillett Jr.|Gillett Communications]] in 1984. Gillett sold the pair to Busse Broadcasting in 1987 to make room for Gillett's acquisition of the [[Storer Broadcasting]] stations. Busse merged with current owner Gray Communications, now Gray Television, in 1998.\n\nFrom KFOR-TV's shutdown in March 1954 until [[KLKN]] signed on in 1996, KOLN was the only commercial station in Lincoln, making it one of the largest cities in the country with only one full-power commercial station. The western half of the market had full network service; it was served by KGIN, ABC affiliate [[KHGI-TV]] and NBC affiliate KHAS-TV. Later, future sister station KSNB-TV broke off from NTV and joined with Grand Island-based [[KTVG-TV]] to become the Fox affiliate for the western half of the market. This resulted in a market that had very little basis in television reality; KOLN/KGIN was the only major-network station shared by the entire market (though KTVG/KSNB added a translator in Lincoln). It was only truly realized when [[direct-broadcast satellite]] gained more penetration at the turn of the century.\n\nDespite being the only station in the market, KOLN had no need to air other networks' programming. Most of the Omaha stations provide at least secondary coverage of Lincoln. Until KMTV and WOWT were dropped at the turn of the millennium, most of them were also available on cable.\n\nFor a time in January 2009, the KOLN/KGIN website included a section about a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate on its second digital subchannel (then used for MyNetworkTV, which was to have moved to a DT3 subcarrier). However, station officials later said there were no immediate plans to launch such a station, describing the page as part of an experimental project not meant for public consumption.<ref name=\"js-kolnnofox\">{{cite news|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2009/01/21/living/gz/video_games/doc4977a2b0e1898215560118.txt|title=KOLN/KGIN-TV explains mysterious \"Fox 10/11' Web sighting|last=Korbelik|first=Jeff|date=January 21, 2009|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|accessdate=January 23, 2009}}</ref> At that time, Fox programming was seen on KSNB-TV (now a sister station to KOLN/KGIN) and [[KTVG-TV]] (channel 17). Although the station refused to rule out launching a digital Fox station in the future, this was rendered moot when then-CW affiliate KCWL-TV relaunched as Fox affiliate KFXL-TV.\n\nThe \"10/11\" brand is so well established in Nebraska that when Gray brought KSNB back on the air in 2012, it initially did so under the branding \"10/11 Central Nebraska.\" Likewise, when it relaunched its longtime translator in [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]] as locally-focused CBS affiliate [[KNPL-LD]], it used the branding \"10/11 North Platte.\"\n\n===KOLN tower collapse===\nOn January 18, 2020, KOLN's transmitter tower near [[Beaver Crossing, Nebraska|Beaver Crossing]] collapsed due to an [[ice storm]].

It not only airs syndicated programs, [[MeTV]] programming, and the entire MyNetworkTV schedule, but also 10/11-produced programming like ''Pure Nebraska'', ''Star City Buzz'' and ''Prepzone Weekly''.\n\nKOLN/KGIN also produces nightly newscasts, ''My News at 9'', formerly ''Nebraska Central News'' & ''10/11 Central Nebraska News'', targeting all of the viewing area and featuring weather forecasts for both eastern (Lincoln) and central (Grand Island/Hastings/Kearney) Nebraska, which airs at 9 p.m. on KSNB's digital subcarrier and KOLN/KGIN's digital subcarrier. ''My News at 9'' only airs on weekdays at 9 p.m. It is produced and aired in high definition.

The three stations can also cover each other's newscasts. Weather on weekends for KSNB is broadcast from their Lincoln studios in a second green screen facility since KOLN is also on air at the same time, and the same is done for KNOP during the weekday evening newscasts. Many news stories are shared between the stations. The result is that essentially for the first time, there is news from the majority of the coverage areas in almost every newscast.\n\n===Analog-to-digital conversion===\nKOLN aired its digital programming on channel 25, while KGIN aired digital programming on channel 32.

A. James Ebel, KOLN's general manager from 1954 to 1985, began this practice not long after he arrived, saying years later, \"The first thing I learned when I arrived here in 1954 is that the weather is the No. 1 story in Nebraska.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.unl.edu/an/spring98/ebel2.html |title=Interview |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030503154302/http://journalism.unl.edu/an/spring98/ebel2.html |archivedate=May 3, 2003 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> Mel Mains served as KOLN's main news anchor for 34 years, from 1961 to 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ne-ba.org/about_us-hall_of_fame.asp?id=18|title= NE BA Hall of Fame}}</ref> Chief meteorologist Ken Siemek has been at the station since 1981.\n\nKOLN/KGIN is one of the few television stations in the United States with a husband/wife anchor team, Jon Vanderford and Taryn Vanderford, who serve as anchors for the station's 4 p.m. newscast and host ''Pure Nebraska'', a rural lifestyle show airing weekdays at 9 a.m.  On September 15, 2007, KOLN/KGIN became the first and only station in the Lincoln\u2013Hastings\u2013Kearney market to broadcast weekend morning newscasts from 7-8 a.m. (The time was later changed to 6:30&nbsp;a.m.-7:30&nbsp;a.m. to accommodate ''Pure Nebraska'''s weekend show on Sundays at 7:30&nbsp;a.m.)  The weekend morning newscasts were later canceled.\n\nOn June 15, 2009, KOLN/KGIN became the first commercial station in Nebraska to broadcast local news in a widescreen format.

It initially focused on Dr. David Keel ([[Ian Hendry]]),<ref name=Hendry>{{cite web|title=Official Website of Ian Hendry|url=http://www.ianhendry.com|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> aided by [[John Steed]] ([[Patrick Macnee]]). Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish and assertive women: [[Cathy Gale]] ([[Honor Blackman]]), [[Emma Peel]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) and [[Tara King]] ([[Linda Thorson]]). The series ran from 1961 until 1969, screening as one-hour episodes for its entire run. The pilot episode, \"[[Hot Snow (The Avengers)|Hot Snow]]\", aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, \"Bizarre\", aired on 21 April 1969 in the United States, and on 21 May 1969 in the United Kingdom.\n\n''The Avengers'' was produced by [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]], a contractor within the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. After a merger with [[Rediffusion London]] in July 1968, ABC Television became [[Thames Television]], which continued production of the series, though it was still broadcast under the ABC name. By 1969, ''The Avengers'' was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series, ''[[The New Avengers (TV series)|The New Avengers]]'' (1976\u20131977), with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners. In 2004 and 2007, ''The Avengers'' was ranked #17 and #20 on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Top Cult Shows Ever.<ref>{{cite news |title=25 Top Cult Shows Ever!|work=TV Guide |date=May 30, 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"TopCultShows\">\"[http://www.tvguide.com/news/top-cult-shows-40239.aspx TV Guide Names the Top Cult Shows Ever \u2013 Today's News: Our Take]\" ''[[TV Guide]]'': 29 June 2007</ref>\n\n==Premise==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\n''The Avengers'' was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went.

A stranger named John Steed, who was investigating the ring, appeared, and together they set out to avenge her death in the first two episodes. Steed asked Keel to partner with him, as needed, to solve crimes. Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two episodes.\n\nAs the first series of ''The Avengers'' progressed, Steed's importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay\u2014and often tension\u2014between Keel's idealism and Steed's professionalism. As seen in one of the three surviving episodes from the first series, \"[[The Frighteners (The Avengers)|The Frighteners]]\", Steed also had helpers among the population who provided information, similar to the \"[[Baker Street Irregulars]]\" of [[Sherlock Holmes]].\n\nThe other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson ([[Ingrid Hafner]]), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (\"[[Girl on the Trapeze]]\") was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Hafner had played opposite Hendry as a nurse in one episode of ''Police Surgeon''.<ref name=\"screenonline.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe series was shot on [[405-line television system|405-line]] videotape using a [[multicamera setup]]. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage was shot (although the very first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of ''The Avengers'' were [[Wiping|reused]]. At present, only three complete Series 1 episodes are known to exist and are held in archives as [[16 mm film|16-mm film]] [[kinescope|telerecordings]]: \"Girl on the Trapeze\" (which does not feature Steed), \"The Frighteners\" and \"[[Tunnel of Fear]]\".<ref name=\"TOF\"/> Additionally, the first 15 minutes of the first episode, \"Hot Snow\", also exist as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.\n\nThe missing television episodes are currently being recreated for audio by [[Big Finish Productions]] under the title of ''The Avengers - The Lost Episodes''<ref name=\"bigfinish.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/the-avengers|title=The Avengers - Steed and Keel|website=Bigfinish.com}}</ref> and star [[Julian Wadham]] as Steed, [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] as Dr. Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.\n\n===Series 2-3 (1962\u20131964)===\n[[File:CathyGale.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Patrick Macnee as [[John Steed]] and [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Cathy Gale]]]]\nProduction of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Macnee was promoted to star and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King ([[Jon Rollason]]), a thinly disguised rewriting of the Keel character, saw action in only three episodes, which were produced from scripts written for the first series. King was intended to be a transitional character between Keel and Steed's two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.\n\n[[Nightclub singer]] Venus Smith ([[Julie Stevens (British actress)|Julie Stevens]]) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete \"amateur\", meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a spy adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes\u2014\"The Removal Men\", \"[[The Decapod]]\"\u2014indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him, and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and [[Tara King]]. Her episodes featured musical interludes showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanor and dress.\n\nThe first episode broadcast in the second series had introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. [[Honor Blackman]] played Dr. [[Cathy Gale]], a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in [[judo]] and had a passion for [[leather]] clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.theavengers.tv/tvt200963.htm |title='&#39;TV Times'&#39; issue 412, 20 September 1963, page 4, Inside Story Of The Avengers: Brief For Murder!, Crime Reporter, England |publisher=Deadline.theavengers.tv |date=20 September 1963 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> Widowed during the [[Mau Mau]] years in [[Kenya]], she was the \"talented amateur\" who saw her aid to Steed's cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born on 5 October 1930 at midnight, and was raised in Africa. Gale was in her early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger.\n\nGale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV, and became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Said series scriptwriter [[Dennis Spooner]]: \"there's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such\u2014it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp46\">Peel, John. \"Dennis Spooner Interview\". ''The Avengers Files: Emma's Last Year''. Psi Fi Movie Press, Inc. Canoga Park, CA, 1985, p 46.</ref> In \"Conspiracy of Silence\", she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.\n\nVenus Smith did not return for the third series, and Cathy Gale became Steed's only regular partner. The series established a level of [[sexual tension]] between Steed and Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond [[flirting]] and [[innuendo]]. Despite this, the relationship between Steed and Gale was progressive for 1962\u201363. In \"The Golden Eggs\", it is revealed that Gale lived in Steed's flat; according to Steed, her rent was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.\n\nDuring the first series, there were hints Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as \"Charles\", and \"One-Ten\" ([[Douglas Muir (actor)|Douglas Muir]]). By the third series, the delivery of Steed's orders was not depicted on screen or explained. The secret organisation to which Steed belongs is shown in \"The Nutshell\", and it is Gale's first visit to their headquarters.\n\nSmall references to Steed's background were occasionally made. In the Series 3 episode \"Death of a Batman\" it was said that Steed was with [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and in [[Munich]] in 1945. In the Series 4 episode \"The Hour That Never Was\", Steed attends a reunion of his [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] regiment. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, it is apparent that he had attended a number of leading public schools.\n\nA theatrical film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963, after Series 3 was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum, Blackman was cast opposite [[Sean Connery]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', requiring her to leave the series.\n\n====Series transformation====\nDuring the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suit, [[bowler hat]] and umbrella, with clothes later designed by [[Pierre Cardin]] (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella during the first series, as \"The Frighteners\" depicts). The bowler and umbrella were soon changed to be full of tricks, including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German and Polish titles of the series, ''Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir'' (\"Bowler hat and leather boots\"), ''Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone'' (\"With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat\") and ''Rewolwer i melonik'' (\"A Revolver and a Bowler Hat\"), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old-world sophistication and vintage automobiles, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.\n\nBy contrast, Steed's partners were youthful, forward-looking and always attired in the latest mod fashions. Gale's innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed \"[[boot fetishism|kinky boots]]\") and her judo-based fighting style. Macnee and Blackman even released a novelty song called \"[[Kinky Boots (song)|Kinky Boots]]\". Blackman also carried a pistol in \"Killer Whale\". Some of the clothes seen in ''The Avengers'' were designed at the studio of [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]], who published the ''[[AtomAge]]'' [[fetish magazine]].\n\nSeries scriptwriter Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene. \"'Can't you afford extras?,' they'd ask. Well, it wasn't like that. It's just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let's face it, with normal people he's ''weird''. The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp46\" />\n\n===Series 4-5 (1965\u20131968)===\nThe show was sold to the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in 1965, and ''The Avengers'' became one of the first British series to be aired on [[Prime time|prime-time]] U.S. television. The ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly \u00a356,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the U.S. from March to the beginning of September 1966.\n\nThe U.S. deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]]. The use of film, rather than the videotape of the earlier episodes, was essential, because British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the U.S. [[NTSC]] videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on U.S. prime-time television at the time. ''The Avengers'' continued to be produced in black and white.\n\nThe transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the [[single camera setup|single-camera setup]], giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles, and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on Series 4 was shot mute, with the soundtrack created in post-production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.\n\n[[File:Emma-Peel Avengers-Intro.jpg|thumb|left|227px|Diana Rigg as Mrs [[Emma Peel]]]]\nNew female partner Mrs. [[Emma Peel]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) debuted in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with \"man appeal\". In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character's name, she was called \"Samantha Peel\", shortened to the awkward \"Mantha Peel\". Eventually, the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand \"M. Appeal\", which gave rise to the character's ultimate name.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Complete Avengers: The Full Story of Britain's Smash Crime-Fighting Team!\n|author=Dave Rogers\n|publisher=Boxtree Ltd\n|date=1989\n|page=87\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KSNQpAU5z80C&pg=PA87\n|accessdate=27 June 2012|isbn=9780312031879\n}}</ref> Emma Peel, whose husband went missing while flying over the Amazon, retained the self-assuredness of Gale, combined with superior fighting skills, intelligence and a contemporary fashion sense.\n\nAfter more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was [[Elizabeth Shepherd]]. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Blackman's Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director, [[Dodo Watts]], suggested that producers [[Brian Clemens]] and [[Albert Fennell]] check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Rigg (she had earlier guested in an episode of ''[[The Sentimental Agent]]'' that Clemens had written). Rigg's screen test with Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.\n\nA prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American broadcasts. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard, a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: \"Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers.\" During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs. Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together as the screen fades to black and the opening titles begin.\n\n[[File:Avengersplate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Film location plate presented by ABC TV to the [[Stapleford Miniature Railway]], which is still in use today]]\nIn contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed's and Peel's interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Gale\u2014who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission\u2014is absent from Steed's interaction with Peel. Also, the sexual tension between Steed and Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Peel. In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have ''carte blanche'' to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest that Steed had spent the night at Gale's or Peel's home, or vice-versa. Although nothing \"improper\" is displayed, the close chemistry between Steed and Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.\n\n[[Science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements (a style later known as [[Spy-fi (neologism)|spy-fi]]) also began to emerge in storylines. The duo encounters killer robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), telepaths (\"Too Many Christmas Trees\") and giant alien carnivorous plants (\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\").\n\nIn her fourth episode, \"Death at Bargain Prices\", Mrs. Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather [[catsuit]] plus silver boots, sash and welder's gloves. The suit (minus the silver accessories) became her signature outfit, which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a [[Fetish fashion|fetishistic]] undercurrent. In \"[[A Touch of Brimstone]]\", Mrs. Peel dresses in a [[dominatrix]] outfit of corset, laced boots and spiked collar to become the \"Queen of Sin\".\n\n[[File:1965 John Bates for Jean Varon mindress 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Bates minidress, 1965. Based on a design for Emma Peel in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=bates38/>]]\nPeel's avant-garde fashions, featuring bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasise her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by [[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]], including graphic black-and-white [[Op art]] mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers and jacket.<ref name=bates38>{{cite book |last1=Lester |first1=Richard |title=John Bates : fashion designer |date=2008 |publisher=ACC Editions |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |isbn=9781851495702 |pages=38, 43}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110107204028/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/object_stories/marit_allen/index.html Garments worn by Marit Allen] at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]], London. Accessed 15/03/2010</ref> She represents [[Swinging London|the modern England of the Sixties]]&nbsp;\u2013 just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian-era nostalgia. According to Macnee in his book ''The Avengers and Me'', Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. [[Pierre Cardin]] was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the U.S., ''[[TV Guide]]'' ran a four-page photo spread on Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10\u201316 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits, in a variety of bright colours, were created using the stretch fabric [[crimplene]].\n\n====Move to colour====\nAfter one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, ''The Avengers'' began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour broadcasting. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the U.S., in colour, and the UK, in black and white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the U.S. until early 1968, where they would be immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Rigg's replacement, [[Linda Thorson]]. The American prologue of the fourth series was modified for the colour episodes. The show opened with the caption ''The Avengers In Color'' (required by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for colour series at that time), followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a [[Champagne|champagne bottle]] and Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the \"chessboard\" opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative voice-over, and the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series.\n\nThe first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed.\" Peel would be conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed, for example. in a newspaper Peel had just bought, or on traffic lights while she was out driving. On one occasion, Steed appeared on Peel's television set, interrupting an old science-fiction movie (actually clips from the Series 4 episode \"The Cybernauts\") to call her to work. Another way Steed contacted her was in the beginning of episode 13, \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station\", when she enters her flat and sees a [[Meccano]] [[Percy the Small Engine]] going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says \"Mrs. Peel\" in bold letters. She then walks over to Steed, who says, \"You're needed.\" At the start of \"The Hidden Tiger\", Peel is redecorating her apartment (wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne) when she peels off a strip of wallpaper, revealing the words \"Mrs Peel\" painted on the wall beneath. She turns to see Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper, revealing \"We're needed\" painted underneath on another wall. In another instance, Emma enters Steed's flat to find that he has just fallen down the stairs, and he painfully gasps, \"Mrs. Peel, you're needed.\" Often, the episode's [[tag scene]] returned to the situation of the \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\" scene. \"The Hidden Tiger\" returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a [[love heart]] and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall, but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito<!-- singular of graffiti -->. In \"The Superlative Seven\" the call to duty and the tag both involve a duck-shooting situation in which unexpected items fall from the sky after shots are fired.\n\nThe series also introduced a comic [[tagline]] caption to the episode title, using the format of \"Steed [does this], Emma [does that].\" For example, \"The Joker\" had the opening caption: \"Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand.\" (\"The Joker\" was to a large extent a rewrite of \"Don't Look Behind You\", a black-and-white Cathy Gale episode. Three other colour Emma Peel episodes were rewrites of Cathy Gale episodes.)\n\nThe \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\" scenes and the alternate taglines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the U.K. networks as disposable if ''The Avengers'' was to return to ITV screens. (Dave Rogers' book ''The Avengers Anew'' lists a set for every Steed/Peel episode except \"The Forget-Me-Knot\".)\n\nStories were increasingly characterised by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (\"Mission... Highly Improbable\"), pet cats being electrically altered to become ferocious and lethal \"miniature tigers\" (\"The Hidden Tiger\"), killer automata (\"Return of The Cybernauts\"), mind-transferring machines (\"Who's Who???\") and invisible foes (\"The See-Through Man\").\n\nThe series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as \"The Girl From AUNTIE\", \"Mission... Highly Improbable\" and \"The Winged Avenger\" (spoofing ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.\n\nHumour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organisations. For example, in \"The Living Dead\", two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends Of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement Of Ghosts). \"The Hidden Tiger\" features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats\u2014PURRR\u2014led by characters named Cheshire, Manx and Angora.\n\nThe series also occasionally adopted a [[metafiction]]al tone, coming close to breaking the [[fourth wall]]. In the Series 5 episode \"Something Nasty in the Nursery\", Peel directly references the series' storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Peel tell viewers\u2014indirectly\u2014to tune in next week.\n\nRigg's stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Rigg in a stunt dive in \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\".\n\n====Rigg's departure====\nRigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series, she learned that she was being paid less than the cameraman. She demanded a raise to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|title=Diana Rigg: The Biography|publisher=BenBella Books|year=2004|page=83|isbn=1-932100-27-X}}</ref> At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', as James Bond's wife [[Tracy Bond]].\n\nRigg and Macnee remained lifelong friends.\n\nOn 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI ([[British Film Institute]]) screened an episode of ''The Avengers'' followed by an onstage interview with Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee's reaction to her departure.<ref>[http://artandhue.com/bfi/ BFI Interview with Dame Diana Rigg] Retrieved 2016-02-18.</ref>\n\n===Series 6 (1968\u20131969)===\n[[File:Patrick MacNee Linda Thorson 1968.JPG|thumb|200px|Macnee and [[Linda Thorson]]]]\nWhen Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus, they decided that a \"return to realism\" was appropriate for the sixth series (1968\u201369). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennel were replaced by [[John Bryce (producer)|John Bryce]], producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.\n\nBryce had a difficult situation to handle. He had to find a replacement for Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to the U.S. together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes. Bryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name Tara King for her character. Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart, and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King. King also differed from Steed's previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Thorson's brown hair was [[Hair coloring#Hair lighteners and bleaches|bleached]]. However, the process badly damaged Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode \"All Done with Mirrors\".\n\nProduction of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began. However, financial problems and internal difficulties undermined Bryce's effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: \"Invitation to a Killing\" (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), \"The Great, Great Britain Crime\" (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode \"Homicide and Old Lace\") and \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig).\n\nAfter a [[rough cut]] screening of these episodes to studio executives, Bryce was fired and Clemens and Fennel were summoned back. At their return, a fourth episode called \"The Murderous Connection\" was in its second day of production. After revising the script, it was renamed as \"The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\" and production resumed. Production of the episode \"Split!\", a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: \"Get-A-Way\", and \"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers\".\n\nDennis Spooner said of the event:{{blockquote|Brian left ''The Avengers'' for about three episodes, someone took over, and when Brian came back, it was in a terrible state. He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they'd already shot.\" The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination. The villains then realise this and pursue him&nbsp;\u2013 yet arrive there before Steed does. It was fixed by having a character ask Steed 'What took you so long?', to which he replies 'I came the pretty way'. \"You can only do that on ''The Avengers'' you see. It was just my favourite show to work on.<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp47-8\">Peel, John. \"Dennis Spooner Interview\". ''The Avengers Files: Emma's Last Year''. Psi Fi Movie Press, Inc. Canoga Park, CA, 1985, p 47-8.</ref>}}\n\nClemens and Fennel decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent King, who mistakes him for her training partner.\n\nNo farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Rigg left the series. She was recalled for \"[[The Forget-Me-Knot]]\", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma that appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British secret service]] to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that \"he likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise.\" Steed looks out of the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter, who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt double, with bowler hat and umbrella).\n\nBryce's original episode introducing Tara, \"Invitation to a Killing\", was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named \"Have Guns Will Haggle\". These episodes, together with \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" and the last eight Peel colour episodes, were shipped to the U.S. in February 1968.\n\nFor this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. [[Mother (The Avengers)|Mother]], introduced in \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by [[Patrick Newell]], who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in Series 5. Mother's headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode in which his complete office was on the top level of a [[double-decker bus]]. (Several [[James Bond]] films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond's briefings.)\n\nAdded later as a regular was Mother's mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named [[Father (The Avengers)|\"Father\"]], a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, \"Killer\", Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney ([[Jennifer Croxton]]) while King is on holiday.\n\nScriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected: \"When I wrote 'Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers', that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went ''really'' weird, because they knew there weren't going to be any more.\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp47\">Peel, John. \"Dennis Spooner Interview\". ''The Avengers Files: Emma's Last Year''. Psi Fi Movie Press, Inc. Canoga Park, CA, 1985, p 47.</ref>\n\nSpooner said the series \"worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.\" He attributes the overall success of the show to its light approach: \"We spoofed everything, we took ''Mission: Impossible'', ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about.\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp47\" />\n\nThe revised series continued to be broadcast in the U.S. The episodes with Linda Thorson as King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK. However, In the U.S. the ABC network chose to air it opposite the number-one show in the country at the time, ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. Steed and King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the U.S. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (\"Bizarre\") has Steed and King, [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the [[fourth wall]] and says to the audience, \"They'll be back!\" before adding in shock, \"They're unchaperoned up there!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Macnee]] as [[John Steed]] (Series 1\u20136)\n* [[Ian Hendry]] as Dr. David Keel (Series 1)\n* [[Jon Rollason]] as Dr Martin King (Series 2)\n* [[Julie Stevens (British actress)|Julie Stevens]] as Venus Smith (Series 2)\n* [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Cathy Gale]] (Series 2\u20133) \n* [[Diana Rigg]] as [[Emma Peel]] (Series 4\u20135)\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as [[Tara King]] (Series 6)\n\n==Production==\n===Music===\n\nThe 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by [[John Dankworth]]. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth's theme music was reworked for the third series. Dankworth's first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by [[Johnny Gregory (bandleader)|Johnny Gregory]].\n\nWhen Rigg joined the series in 1965, the opening credits of the series were redesigned and new theme music by [[Laurie Johnson]] was introduced. This was based on a previously released title, on LP called \"The Shake\" <ref>[http://theavengers.tv/forever/music.htm \"The Avengers - The Music\"], by Max Pemberton (retrieved December 28, 2015)</ref> (which capitalised on \"[[The Shake (dance)|The Shake]]\" dance craze of the 60s<ref>Dave Rogers, \"The Complete Avengers: The Full Story of Britain's Smash Crime-Fighting Team!\", 1989, {{ISBN|0312031874}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSNQpAU5z80C&pg=PA276 p. 276]</ref>). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter-melody on trumpet, based on the [[leitmotif]] for Tara King from the final Rigg episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot\". The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", which introduced Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson. To accompany Steed's request \"Mrs Peel \u2013 we're needed!\", he composed a brief 'sting', and there was also a special theme for 'Emma'. For the 'Thorson' series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the 'Tag Scene' were released commercially on CD in 2009.\n\nOwing to a professional commitment to score for the film ''[[Hot Millions]]'' (starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith), Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, [[Howard Blake]], who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Johnson's. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost-complete scores by Blake\u2212including Johnson's themes for the main and end titles\u2014were issued on a double CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series ''The New Avengers''.\n\nJohnson subsequently collaborated with Clemens on other projects, including the theme for ''The New Avengers''.\n\n===Cars===\nThe cars used in the series became almost as famous as the actors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/cars.htm|title=The Avengers Forever: Avenging Vehicles|website=Theavengers.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissolute.com.au/the-avengers-tv-series/cars/|title=The Avengers : Transport Guide|website=Dissolute.com.au}}</ref>  From the 4th season on, Steed's signature cars were six vintage green 1926\u20131928 [[Bentley]] racing or town cars, including [[Blower Bentley]]s and [[Bentley Speed Six]]es (although, uniquely, in \"The Thirteenth Hole\" he drives a [[Vauxhall 30-98]]). In the final season he drove two yellow [[Rolls Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]]s \u2013 a 1923 [[Rolls Royce Silver Ghost]] and a 1927 [[Carrosserie Vanvooren#Working with Rolls-Royce|Rolls Royce New Phantom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/cars-2.htm|title=The Avengers Forever: Avenging Vehicles|website=theavengers.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsteedsflat.com/cars.html|title=Steed's Cars|website=Johnsteedsflat.com}}</ref> Peel drove [[Lotus Elan]] convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colinchapmanmuseum.org.uk/?page_id=196|title=Lotus & The Avengers|website=Colinchapmanmuseum.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/cars-1.htm|title=The Avengers Forever: Avenging Vehicles|website=Theavengers.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imcdb.org/m54518.html|title=The Avengers, 1961-1969|publisher=Internet Movie Cars Database}}</ref> which, like her clothes, emphasised her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Season 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle.  Mother occasionally appeared in a silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an [[AC Cars|AC 428]] and a [[Lotus Europa]]. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an [[MG MGB#MGC|MGC Roadster]].\n\n===Production team===\n[[Sydney Newman]], who would later go on to spearhead the creation of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of ''The Avengers''. In his memoir, ''The Avengers and Me'', Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for ''The Avengers''.<ref>Patrick Macnee and Dave Rogers, ''The Avengers and Me'' (TV Books, 1998, {{ISBN|1575000598}}); republished in 2008 as ''The Avengers: The Inside Story'' (Titan Books, {{ISBN|1845766431}})</ref>\n\nThe production team changed during the series' long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of [[Brian Clemens]] was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series' most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers [[Leonard White (producer)|Leonard White]] and John Bryce, [[Julian Wintle]] became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as Associate Producer and [[Albert Fennell]] credited as \"In charge of production\". For series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films, (which was created during the run-up to Associated British Corporation and Associated-Redifussion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as Executive Producer. For series 6, after its first producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers; early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as Consultant to the series and [[Philip Levene]] as Story Consultant.\n\n[[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with [[Chee Soo]] and they worked techniques from [[Feng Shou]] Kung fu and [[Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai Chi]] into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness world record]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-western-actress-to-perform-kung-fu-on-television/|title=First western actress to perform kung fu on television|publisher=}}</ref> as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Avengers episodes}}\n\nSix series of ''The Avengers'' were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors [[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]] in their book ''The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide'' consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of ''The Avengers'' the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.\n\n==Reception==\n===In Canada and the United States===\nAlthough telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of ''The Avengers'' were not broadcast on television in the United States. ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 4 and 5 in the United States in 1965. The sale of ''The Avengers'' to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single-camera shooting method, originated on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe series' stunt man and stunt arranger [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] expressed the opinion that the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There ''The Avengers'' was given a late timeslot due to its violence. \"They did that with the first ''Avengers'' here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS {{sic}}, because it was too violent.\" Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a \"different code\". Austin said that on ''The Avengers'' \"we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York\u2014you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it.\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnSeasons3&4p83\">Peel, John. \"Ray Austin Interview\".

U.S. audiences saw the 1962\u20131964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the [[A&E Network]]. No Keel episode of the series was ever repeatedly broadcast outside Britain, contributing to the fact nearly all first-series episodes are now lost, and even in the UK only one surviving episode, \"The Frighteners\", was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on [[Channel 4]] in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_repeats.htm |title=The Avengers Declassified: Keel and Steed |publisher=Declassified.theavengers.tv |accessdate=27 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202739/http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_repeats.htm |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nAll original videotapes from series one, two and three, which were shot on video, were [[wiping|wiped]].\n\nOnly three complete episodes from the show's first series, plus a portion of another episode, are known to exist, as 16mm film [[telerecording]]s.

The two earlier-found surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000s, [[A&E Home Video|A&E TV Home Entertainment]] (under license from [[Studiocanal|Canal+ Image International]]) released the remaining surviving series on Region 1 DVD in North America, with newly-remastered picture and sound quality.\n\n==Sequel==\n===''The New Avengers''===\n{{Main|The New Avengers (TV series)}}\n\nThe sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for [[Laurent-Perrier]] champagne, in which Thorson and Macnee reprised their roles. The advertisement's success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of ''The Avengers''.\n\nThe result was a new series, ''The New Avengers''. Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit ([[Gareth Hunt]]) and Purdey ([[Joanna Lumley]]). It aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the UK in 1976\u20131977, [[CTV television network|CTV]] in Canada, [[CBS]] in the United States (in 1978\u201379) and [[TF1]] in France (series 1 in 1976\u20131977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title ''The New Avengers in Canada''. \n\nAlthough Macnee was the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, archival footage of Diana Rigg allowed Emma Peel to make a cameo appearance in a second season episode \"K is for Kill: The Tiger Awakes\", while Macnee's first co-star, Ian Hendry, made a guest appearance as a different character in the episode \"To Catch a Rat.\"\n\n==Spin-offs==\n\n===Novels===\nA number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadduck.theavengers.tv/bookshel.htm|title=The Avengers - Official Novelisations|work=theavengers.tv}}</ref> The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. In the UK, Panther books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in 1967. These were reprinted in the US by Berkley Medallion books. After Panther stopped publishing ''Avengers'' novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Emma Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which ''Avengers'' girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, ''Deadline'' and ''Dead Duck'', were reprinted in the UK by [[Titan Books]] in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 & 1996). They were also published in the US for the first time by TV Books in 1998.

The Avengers were played by two British expatriate actors, Donald Monat as Steed and Diane Appleby as Mrs Peel, with Hugh Rouse as the tongue-in-cheek narrator. The stories were adapted into five-episode serials under [[Tony Jay]] and six- and seven-episode serials under Dennis Folbigge, of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week, Monday-Friday, on Springbok Radio.\n\nCurrently only 19 complete serials survive, all from [[reel-to-reel]] off-air recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also, the first three episodes of a remake of ''Escape In Time'' currently exist. Episodes 1 and 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and episode 3 is from an off-air recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson; the rest of this serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station [[WBAI]] on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station [[WRGP]] on early Monday mornings.\n\nCopies from the original off-air recordings have been restored by Alan and Alys Hayes, and can be heard at their \"The Avengers Declassified\" website and its sister website \"Avengers on the Radio\".\nMany more serials were broadcast during its two-year run on South African radio, it is thought 83 serials were made and transmitted, but no other episodes are known to exist at present.\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|The Avengers (1998 film)}}\n\nPlans for a motion picture based upon the series circulated during the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s, with [[Mel Gibson]] at one point being considered a front-runner for the role of Steed. Ultimately, the 1998 film starring [[Uma Thurman]] as Emma Peel and [[Ralph Fiennes]] as John Steed, with [[Sean Connery]] as the villain, received extremely [[List of films considered the worst#The Avengers (1998)|negative reviews from critics]] and fans, and was a major flop.\n\n===Audio===\nOn 26 June 2013 [[Big Finish Productions]] announced they had signed a license with [[StudioCanal]] to produce full-cast audio productions of 12 lost episodes from Season 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/the-avengers-licenced|title=The Avengers Licensed! - News - Big Finish|website=Bigfinish.com}}</ref>\n\nThe main cast includes [[Julian Wadham]] as Steed, [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] as Dr. David Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.

It initially focused on Dr. David Keel ([[Ian Hendry]]),<ref name=Hendry>{{cite web|title=Official Website of Ian Hendry|url=http://www.ianhendry.com|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> aided by [[John Steed]] ([[Patrick Macnee]]). Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish and assertive women: [[Cathy Gale]] ([[Honor Blackman]]), [[Emma Peel]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) and [[Tara King]] ([[Linda Thorson]]). The series ran from 1961 until 1969, screening as one-hour episodes for its entire run. The pilot episode, \"[[Hot Snow (The Avengers)|Hot Snow]]\", aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, \"Bizarre\", aired on 21 April 1969 in the United States, and on 21 May 1969 in the United Kingdom.\n\n''The Avengers'' was produced by [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]], a contractor within the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. After a merger with [[Rediffusion London]] in July 1968, ABC Television became [[Thames Television]], which continued production of the series, though it was still broadcast under the ABC name. By 1969, ''The Avengers'' was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series, ''[[The New Avengers (TV series)|The New Avengers]]'' (1976\u20131977), with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners. In 2004 and 2007, ''The Avengers'' was ranked #17 and #20 on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Top Cult Shows Ever.<ref>{{cite news |title=25 Top Cult Shows Ever!|work=TV Guide |date=May 30, 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"TopCultShows\">\"[http://www.tvguide.com/news/top-cult-shows-40239.aspx TV Guide Names the Top Cult Shows Ever \u2013 Today's News: Our Take]\" ''[[TV Guide]]'': 29 June 2007</ref>\n\n==Premise==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\n''The Avengers'' was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went. The only constant was [[John Steed]], played by [[Patrick Macnee]].\n\n===Series 1 (1961)===\n[[Associated British Corporation]] produced (as ABC Television) a single series of ''[[Police Surgeon (UK)|Police Surgeon]]'', in which [[Ian Hendry]] played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent, from September through December of 1960.<ref name=\"screenonline.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/550338/ |title=BFI Screenonline: Police Surgeon (1960) |publisher=Screenonline.org.uk |date=3 December 1960 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> While ''Police Surgeon'' did not last long, viewers praised Hendry, and ABC Television cast him in its new series ''The Avengers'', which replaced ''Police Surgeon'' in January 1961.\n\n''The Avengers'' began with the episode \"[[Hot Snow (The Avengers)|Hot Snow]]\", in which medical doctor David Keel (Hendry) investigates the murder of his fianc\u00e9e and office receptionist Peggy by a drug ring. A stranger named John Steed, who was investigating the ring, appeared, and together they set out to avenge her death in the first two episodes. Steed asked Keel to partner with him, as needed, to solve crimes. Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two episodes.\n\nAs the first series of ''The Avengers'' progressed, Steed's importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay\u2014and often tension\u2014between Keel's idealism and Steed's professionalism. As seen in one of the three surviving episodes from the first series, \"[[The Frighteners (The Avengers)|The Frighteners]]\", Steed also had helpers among the population who provided information, similar to the \"[[Baker Street Irregulars]]\" of [[Sherlock Holmes]].\n\nThe other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson ([[Ingrid Hafner]]), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (\"[[Girl on the Trapeze]]\") was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Hafner had played opposite Hendry as a nurse in one episode of ''Police Surgeon''.<ref name=\"screenonline.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe series was shot on [[405-line television system|405-line]] videotape using a [[multicamera setup]]. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage was shot (although the very first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of ''The Avengers'' were [[Wiping|reused]]. At present, only three complete Series 1 episodes are known to exist and are held in archives as [[16 mm film|16-mm film]] [[kinescope|telerecordings]]: \"Girl on the Trapeze\" (which does not feature Steed), \"The Frighteners\" and \"[[Tunnel of Fear]]\".<ref name=\"TOF\"/> Additionally, the first 15 minutes of the first episode, \"Hot Snow\", also exist as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.\n\nThe missing television episodes are currently being recreated for audio by [[Big Finish Productions]] under the title of ''The Avengers - The Lost Episodes''<ref name=\"bigfinish.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/the-avengers|title=The Avengers - Steed and Keel|website=Bigfinish.com}}</ref> and star [[Julian Wadham]] as Steed, [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] as Dr. Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.\n\n===Series 2-3 (1962\u20131964)===\n[[File:CathyGale.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Patrick Macnee as [[John Steed]] and [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Cathy Gale]]]]\nProduction of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Macnee was promoted to star and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King ([[Jon Rollason]]), a thinly disguised rewriting of the Keel character, saw action in only three episodes, which were produced from scripts written for the first series. King was intended to be a transitional character between Keel and Steed's two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.\n\n[[Nightclub singer]] Venus Smith ([[Julie Stevens (British actress)|Julie Stevens]]) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete \"amateur\", meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a spy adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes\u2014\"The Removal Men\", \"[[The Decapod]]\"\u2014indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him, and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and [[Tara King]]. Her episodes featured musical interludes showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanor and dress.\n\nThe first episode broadcast in the second series had introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. [[Honor Blackman]] played Dr. [[Cathy Gale]], a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in [[judo]] and had a passion for [[leather]] clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.theavengers.tv/tvt200963.htm |title='&#39;TV Times'&#39; issue 412, 20 September 1963, page 4, Inside Story Of The Avengers: Brief For Murder!, Crime Reporter, England |publisher=Deadline.theavengers.tv |date=20 September 1963 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> Widowed during the [[Mau Mau]] years in [[Kenya]], she was the \"talented amateur\" who saw her aid to Steed's cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born on 5 October 1930 at midnight, and was raised in Africa. Gale was in her early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger.\n\nGale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV, and became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Said series scriptwriter [[Dennis Spooner]]: \"there's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such\u2014it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp46\">Peel, John. \"Dennis Spooner Interview\". ''The Avengers Files: Emma's Last Year''. Psi Fi Movie Press, Inc. Canoga Park, CA, 1985, p 46.</ref> In \"Conspiracy of Silence\", she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.\n\nVenus Smith did not return for the third series, and Cathy Gale became Steed's only regular partner. The series established a level of [[sexual tension]] between Steed and Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond [[flirting]] and [[innuendo]]. Despite this, the relationship between Steed and Gale was progressive for 1962\u201363. In \"The Golden Eggs\", it is revealed that Gale lived in Steed's flat; according to Steed, her rent was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.\n\nDuring the first series, there were hints Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as \"Charles\", and \"One-Ten\" ([[Douglas Muir (actor)|Douglas Muir]]). By the third series, the delivery of Steed's orders was not depicted on screen or explained. The secret organisation to which Steed belongs is shown in \"The Nutshell\", and it is Gale's first visit to their headquarters.\n\nSmall references to Steed's background were occasionally made. In the Series 3 episode \"Death of a Batman\" it was said that Steed was with [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and in [[Munich]] in 1945. In the Series 4 episode \"The Hour That Never Was\", Steed attends a reunion of his [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] regiment. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, it is apparent that he had attended a number of leading public schools.\n\nA theatrical film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963, after Series 3 was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum, Blackman was cast opposite [[Sean Connery]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', requiring her to leave the series.\n\n====Series transformation====\nDuring the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suit, [[bowler hat]] and umbrella, with clothes later designed by [[Pierre Cardin]] (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella during the first series, as \"The Frighteners\" depicts). The bowler and umbrella were soon changed to be full of tricks, including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German and Polish titles of the series, ''Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir'' (\"Bowler hat and leather boots\"), ''Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone'' (\"With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat\") and ''Rewolwer i melonik'' (\"A Revolver and a Bowler Hat\"), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old-world sophistication and vintage automobiles, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.\n\nBy contrast, Steed's partners were youthful, forward-looking and always attired in the latest mod fashions. Gale's innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed \"[[boot fetishism|kinky boots]]\") and her judo-based fighting style. Macnee and Blackman even released a novelty song called \"[[Kinky Boots (song)|Kinky Boots]]\". Blackman also carried a pistol in \"Killer Whale\". Some of the clothes seen in ''The Avengers'' were designed at the studio of [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]], who published the ''[[AtomAge]]'' [[fetish magazine]].\n\nSeries scriptwriter Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene. \"'Can't you afford extras?,' they'd ask. Well, it wasn't like that. It's just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let's face it, with normal people he's ''weird''. The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp46\" />\n\n===Series 4-5 (1965\u20131968)===\nThe show was sold to the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in 1965, and ''The Avengers'' became one of the first British series to be aired on [[Prime time|prime-time]] U.S. television. The ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly \u00a356,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the U.S. from March to the beginning of September 1966.\n\nThe U.S. deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]]. The use of film, rather than the videotape of the earlier episodes, was essential, because British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the U.S. [[NTSC]] videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on U.S. prime-time television at the time. ''The Avengers'' continued to be produced in black and white.\n\nThe transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the [[single camera setup|single-camera setup]], giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles, and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on Series 4 was shot mute, with the soundtrack created in post-production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.\n\n[[File:Emma-Peel Avengers-Intro.jpg|thumb|left|227px|Diana Rigg as Mrs [[Emma Peel]]]]\nNew female partner Mrs. [[Emma Peel]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) debuted in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with \"man appeal\". In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character's name, she was called \"Samantha Peel\", shortened to the awkward \"Mantha Peel\". Eventually, the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand \"M. Appeal\", which gave rise to the character's ultimate name.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Complete Avengers: The Full Story of Britain's Smash Crime-Fighting Team!\n|author=Dave Rogers\n|publisher=Boxtree Ltd\n|date=1989\n|page=87\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KSNQpAU5z80C&pg=PA87\n|accessdate=27 June 2012|isbn=9780312031879\n}}</ref> Emma Peel, whose husband went missing while flying over the Amazon, retained the self-assuredness of Gale, combined with superior fighting skills, intelligence and a contemporary fashion sense.\n\nAfter more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was [[Elizabeth Shepherd]]. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Blackman's Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director, [[Dodo Watts]], suggested that producers [[Brian Clemens]] and [[Albert Fennell]] check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Rigg (she had earlier guested in an episode of ''[[The Sentimental Agent]]'' that Clemens had written). Rigg's screen test with Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.\n\nA prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American broadcasts. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard, a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: \"Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers.\" During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs. Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together as the screen fades to black and the opening titles begin.\n\n[[File:Avengersplate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Film location plate presented by ABC TV to the [[Stapleford Miniature Railway]], which is still in use today]]\nIn contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed's and Peel's interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Gale\u2014who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission\u2014is absent from Steed's interaction with Peel. Also, the sexual tension between Steed and Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Peel. In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have ''carte blanche'' to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest that Steed had spent the night at Gale's or Peel's home, or vice-versa. Although nothing \"improper\" is displayed, the close chemistry between Steed and Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.\n\n[[Science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements (a style later known as [[Spy-fi (neologism)|spy-fi]]) also began to emerge in storylines. The duo encounters killer robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), telepaths (\"Too Many Christmas Trees\") and giant alien carnivorous plants (\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\").\n\nIn her fourth episode, \"Death at Bargain Prices\", Mrs. Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather [[catsuit]] plus silver boots, sash and welder's gloves. The suit (minus the silver accessories) became her signature outfit, which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a [[Fetish fashion|fetishistic]] undercurrent.

For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by [[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]], including graphic black-and-white [[Op art]] mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers and jacket.<ref name=bates38>{{cite book |last1=Lester |first1=Richard |title=John Bates : fashion designer |date=2008 |publisher=ACC Editions |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |isbn=9781851495702 |pages=38, 43}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110107204028/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/object_stories/marit_allen/index.html Garments worn by Marit Allen] at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]], London.

According to Macnee in his book ''The Avengers and Me'', Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. [[Pierre Cardin]] was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the U.S., ''[[TV Guide]]'' ran a four-page photo spread on Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10\u201316 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits, in a variety of bright colours, were created using the stretch fabric [[crimplene]].\n\n====Move to colour====\nAfter one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, ''The Avengers'' began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour broadcasting. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the U.S., in colour, and the UK, in black and white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the U.S. until early 1968, where they would be immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Rigg's replacement, [[Linda Thorson]]. The American prologue of the fourth series was modified for the colour episodes. The show opened with the caption ''The Avengers In Color'' (required by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for colour series at that time), followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a [[Champagne|champagne bottle]] and Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the \"chessboard\" opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative voice-over, and the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series.\n\nThe first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed.\" Peel would be conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed, for example. in a newspaper Peel had just bought, or on traffic lights while she was out driving. On one occasion, Steed appeared on Peel's television set, interrupting an old science-fiction movie (actually clips from the Series 4 episode \"The Cybernauts\") to call her to work. Another way Steed contacted her was in the beginning of episode 13, \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station\", when she enters her flat and sees a [[Meccano]] [[Percy the Small Engine]] going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says \"Mrs. Peel\" in bold letters. She then walks over to Steed, who says, \"You're needed.\" At the start of \"The Hidden Tiger\", Peel is redecorating her apartment (wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne) when she peels off a strip of wallpaper, revealing the words \"Mrs Peel\" painted on the wall beneath. She turns to see Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper, revealing \"We're needed\" painted underneath on another wall. In another instance, Emma enters Steed's flat to find that he has just fallen down the stairs, and he painfully gasps, \"Mrs. Peel, you're needed.\" Often, the episode's [[tag scene]] returned to the situation of the \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\" scene. \"The Hidden Tiger\" returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a [[love heart]] and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall, but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito<!-- singular of graffiti -->. In \"The Superlative Seven\" the call to duty and the tag both involve a duck-shooting situation in which unexpected items fall from the sky after shots are fired.\n\nThe series also introduced a comic [[tagline]] caption to the episode title, using the format of \"Steed [does this], Emma [does that].\" For example, \"The Joker\" had the opening caption: \"Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand.\" (\"The Joker\" was to a large extent a rewrite of \"Don't Look Behind You\", a black-and-white Cathy Gale episode. Three other colour Emma Peel episodes were rewrites of Cathy Gale episodes.)\n\nThe \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\" scenes and the alternate taglines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the U.K. networks as disposable if ''The Avengers'' was to return to ITV screens. (Dave Rogers' book ''The Avengers Anew'' lists a set for every Steed/Peel episode except \"The Forget-Me-Knot\".)\n\nStories were increasingly characterised by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (\"Mission... Highly Improbable\"), pet cats being electrically altered to become ferocious and lethal \"miniature tigers\" (\"The Hidden Tiger\"), killer automata (\"Return of The Cybernauts\"), mind-transferring machines (\"Who's Who???\") and invisible foes (\"The See-Through Man\").\n\nThe series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as \"The Girl From AUNTIE\", \"Mission... Highly Improbable\" and \"The Winged Avenger\" (spoofing ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.\n\nHumour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organisations. For example, in \"The Living Dead\", two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends Of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement Of Ghosts). \"The Hidden Tiger\" features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats\u2014PURRR\u2014led by characters named Cheshire, Manx and Angora.\n\nThe series also occasionally adopted a [[metafiction]]al tone, coming close to breaking the [[fourth wall]]. In the Series 5 episode \"Something Nasty in the Nursery\", Peel directly references the series' storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Peel tell viewers\u2014indirectly\u2014to tune in next week.\n\nRigg's stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Rigg in a stunt dive in \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\".\n\n====Rigg's departure====\nRigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series, she learned that she was being paid less than the cameraman. She demanded a raise to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|title=Diana Rigg: The Biography|publisher=BenBella Books|year=2004|page=83|isbn=1-932100-27-X}}</ref> At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', as James Bond's wife [[Tracy Bond]].\n\nRigg and Macnee remained lifelong friends.\n\nOn 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI ([[British Film Institute]]) screened an episode of ''The Avengers'' followed by an onstage interview with Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee's reaction to her departure.<ref>[http://artandhue.com/bfi/ BFI Interview with Dame Diana Rigg] Retrieved 2016-02-18.</ref>\n\n===Series 6 (1968\u20131969)===\n[[File:Patrick MacNee Linda Thorson 1968.JPG|thumb|200px|Macnee and [[Linda Thorson]]]]\nWhen Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus, they decided that a \"return to realism\" was appropriate for the sixth series (1968\u201369). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennel were replaced by [[John Bryce (producer)|John Bryce]], producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.\n\nBryce had a difficult situation to handle. He had to find a replacement for Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to the U.S. together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes. Bryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name Tara King for her character. Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart, and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King. King also differed from Steed's previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Thorson's brown hair was [[Hair coloring#Hair lighteners and bleaches|bleached]]. However, the process badly damaged Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode \"All Done with Mirrors\".\n\nProduction of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began. However, financial problems and internal difficulties undermined Bryce's effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: \"Invitation to a Killing\" (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), \"The Great, Great Britain Crime\" (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode \"Homicide and Old Lace\") and \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig).\n\nAfter a [[rough cut]] screening of these episodes to studio executives, Bryce was fired and Clemens and Fennel were summoned back. At their return, a fourth episode called \"The Murderous Connection\" was in its second day of production. After revising the script, it was renamed as \"The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\" and production resumed. Production of the episode \"Split!\", a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: \"Get-A-Way\", and \"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers\".\n\nDennis Spooner said of the event:{{blockquote|Brian left ''The Avengers'' for about three episodes, someone took over, and when Brian came back, it was in a terrible state. He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they'd already shot.\" The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination. The villains then realise this and pursue him&nbsp;\u2013 yet arrive there before Steed does. It was fixed by having a character ask Steed 'What took you so long?', to which he replies 'I came the pretty way'. \"You can only do that on ''The Avengers'' you see. It was just my favourite show to work on.<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp47-8\">Peel, John. \"Dennis Spooner Interview\". ''The Avengers Files: Emma's Last Year''. Psi Fi Movie Press, Inc. Canoga Park, CA, 1985, p 47-8.</ref>}}\n\nClemens and Fennel decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent King, who mistakes him for her training partner.\n\nNo farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Rigg left the series. She was recalled for \"[[The Forget-Me-Knot]]\", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma that appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British secret service]] to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that \"he likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise.\" Steed looks out of the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter, who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt double, with bowler hat and umbrella).\n\nBryce's original episode introducing Tara, \"Invitation to a Killing\", was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named \"Have Guns Will Haggle\". These episodes, together with \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" and the last eight Peel colour episodes, were shipped to the U.S. in February 1968.\n\nFor this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. [[Mother (The Avengers)|Mother]], introduced in \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by [[Patrick Newell]], who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in Series 5. Mother's headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode in which his complete office was on the top level of a [[double-decker bus]]. (Several [[James Bond]] films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond's briefings.)\n\nAdded later as a regular was Mother's mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named [[Father (The Avengers)|\"Father\"]], a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, \"Killer\", Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney ([[Jennifer Croxton]]) while King is on holiday.\n\nScriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected: \"When I wrote 'Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers', that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went ''really'' weird, because they knew there weren't going to be any more.\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp47\">Peel, John. \"Dennis Spooner Interview\". ''The Avengers Files: Emma's Last Year''. Psi Fi Movie Press, Inc. Canoga Park, CA, 1985, p 47.</ref>\n\nSpooner said the series \"worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.\" He attributes the overall success of the show to its light approach: \"We spoofed everything, we took ''Mission: Impossible'', ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about.\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnEmmaLastYearp47\" />\n\nThe revised series continued to be broadcast in the U.S. The episodes with Linda Thorson as King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK. However, In the U.S. the ABC network chose to air it opposite the number-one show in the country at the time, ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. Steed and King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the U.S. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (\"Bizarre\") has Steed and King, [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the [[fourth wall]] and says to the audience, \"They'll be back!\" before adding in shock, \"They're unchaperoned up there!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Macnee]] as [[John Steed]] (Series 1\u20136)\n* [[Ian Hendry]] as Dr. David Keel (Series 1)\n* [[Jon Rollason]] as Dr Martin King (Series 2)\n* [[Julie Stevens (British actress)|Julie Stevens]] as Venus Smith (Series 2)\n* [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Cathy Gale]] (Series 2\u20133) \n* [[Diana Rigg]] as [[Emma Peel]] (Series 4\u20135)\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as [[Tara King]] (Series 6)\n\n==Production==\n===Music===\n\nThe 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by [[John Dankworth]]. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth's theme music was reworked for the third series. Dankworth's first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by [[Johnny Gregory (bandleader)|Johnny Gregory]].\n\nWhen Rigg joined the series in 1965, the opening credits of the series were redesigned and new theme music by [[Laurie Johnson]] was introduced. This was based on a previously released title, on LP called \"The Shake\" <ref>[http://theavengers.tv/forever/music.htm \"The Avengers - The Music\"], by Max Pemberton (retrieved December 28, 2015)</ref> (which capitalised on \"[[The Shake (dance)|The Shake]]\" dance craze of the 60s<ref>Dave Rogers, \"The Complete Avengers: The Full Story of Britain's Smash Crime-Fighting Team!\", 1989, {{ISBN|0312031874}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSNQpAU5z80C&pg=PA276 p. 276]</ref>). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter-melody on trumpet, based on the [[leitmotif]] for Tara King from the final Rigg episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot\". The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", which introduced Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson. To accompany Steed's request \"Mrs Peel \u2013 we're needed!\", he composed a brief 'sting', and there was also a special theme for 'Emma'. For the 'Thorson' series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the 'Tag Scene' were released commercially on CD in 2009.\n\nOwing to a professional commitment to score for the film ''[[Hot Millions]]'' (starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith), Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, [[Howard Blake]], who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Johnson's. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost-complete scores by Blake\u2212including Johnson's themes for the main and end titles\u2014were issued on a double CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series ''The New Avengers''.\n\nJohnson subsequently collaborated with Clemens on other projects, including the theme for ''The New Avengers''.\n\n===Cars===\nThe cars used in the series became almost as famous as the actors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/cars.htm|title=The Avengers Forever: Avenging Vehicles|website=Theavengers.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissolute.com.au/the-avengers-tv-series/cars/|title=The Avengers : Transport Guide|website=Dissolute.com.au}}</ref>  From the 4th season on, Steed's signature cars were six vintage green 1926\u20131928 [[Bentley]] racing or town cars, including [[Blower Bentley]]s and [[Bentley Speed Six]]es (although, uniquely, in \"The Thirteenth Hole\" he drives a [[Vauxhall 30-98]]). In the final season he drove two yellow [[Rolls Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]]s \u2013 a 1923 [[Rolls Royce Silver Ghost]] and a 1927 [[Carrosserie Vanvooren#Working with Rolls-Royce|Rolls Royce New Phantom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/cars-2.htm|title=The Avengers Forever: Avenging Vehicles|website=theavengers.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsteedsflat.com/cars.html|title=Steed's Cars|website=Johnsteedsflat.com}}</ref> Peel drove [[Lotus Elan]] convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colinchapmanmuseum.org.uk/?page_id=196|title=Lotus & The Avengers|website=Colinchapmanmuseum.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/cars-1.htm|title=The Avengers Forever: Avenging Vehicles|website=Theavengers.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imcdb.org/m54518.html|title=The Avengers, 1961-1969|publisher=Internet Movie Cars Database}}</ref> which, like her clothes, emphasised her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Season 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle.  Mother occasionally appeared in a silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an [[AC Cars|AC 428]] and a [[Lotus Europa]]. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an [[MG MGB#MGC|MGC Roadster]].\n\n===Production team===\n[[Sydney Newman]], who would later go on to spearhead the creation of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of ''The Avengers''. In his memoir, ''The Avengers and Me'', Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for ''The Avengers''.<ref>Patrick Macnee and Dave Rogers, ''The Avengers and Me'' (TV Books, 1998, {{ISBN|1575000598}}); republished in 2008 as ''The Avengers: The Inside Story'' (Titan Books, {{ISBN|1845766431}})</ref>\n\nThe production team changed during the series' long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of [[Brian Clemens]] was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series' most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers [[Leonard White (producer)|Leonard White]] and John Bryce, [[Julian Wintle]] became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as Associate Producer and [[Albert Fennell]] credited as \"In charge of production\". For series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films, (which was created during the run-up to Associated British Corporation and Associated-Redifussion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as Executive Producer. For series 6, after its first producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers; early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as Consultant to the series and [[Philip Levene]] as Story Consultant.\n\n[[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with [[Chee Soo]] and they worked techniques from [[Feng Shou]] Kung fu and [[Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai Chi]] into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness world record]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-western-actress-to-perform-kung-fu-on-television/|title=First western actress to perform kung fu on television|publisher=}}</ref> as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Avengers episodes}}\n\nSix series of ''The Avengers'' were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors [[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]] in their book ''The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide'' consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of ''The Avengers'' the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.\n\n==Reception==\n===In Canada and the United States===\nAlthough telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of ''The Avengers'' were not broadcast on television in the United States. ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 4 and 5 in the United States in 1965. The sale of ''The Avengers'' to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single-camera shooting method, originated on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe series' stunt man and stunt arranger [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] expressed the opinion that the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There ''The Avengers'' was given a late timeslot due to its violence. \"They did that with the first ''Avengers'' here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS {{sic}}, because it was too violent.\" Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a \"different code\". Austin said that on ''The Avengers'' \"we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York\u2014you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it.\"<ref name=\"PeelJohnSeasons3&4p83\">Peel, John. \"Ray Austin Interview\".

No Keel episode of the series was ever repeatedly broadcast outside Britain, contributing to the fact nearly all first-series episodes are now lost, and even in the UK only one surviving episode, \"The Frighteners\", was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on [[Channel 4]] in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_repeats.htm |title=The Avengers Declassified: Keel and Steed |publisher=Declassified.theavengers.tv |accessdate=27 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202739/http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_repeats.htm |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nAll original videotapes from series one, two and three, which were shot on video, were [[wiping|wiped]].\n\nOnly three complete episodes from the show's first series, plus a portion of another episode, are known to exist, as 16mm film [[telerecording]]s.

The two earlier-found surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000\u2019s, [[A&E Home Video|A&E TV Home Entertainment]] (under license from [[Studiocanal|Canal+ Image International]]) released the remaining surviving series on Region 1 DVD in North America, with newly-remastered picture and sound quality.\n\n==Sequel==\n===''The New Avengers''===\n{{Main|The New Avengers (TV series)}}\n\nThe sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for [[Laurent-Perrier]] champagne, in which Thorson and Macnee reprised their roles. The advertisement's success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of ''The Avengers''.\n\nThe result was a new series, ''The New Avengers''. Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit ([[Gareth Hunt]]) and Purdey ([[Joanna Lumley]]). It aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the UK in 1976\u20131977, [[CTV television network|CTV]] in Canada, [[CBS]] in the United States (in 1978\u201379) and [[TF1]] in France (series 1 in 1976\u20131977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title ''The New Avengers in Canada''. \n\nAlthough Macnee was the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, archival footage of Diana Rigg allowed Emma Peel to make a cameo appearance in a second season episode \"K is for Kill: The Tiger Awakes\", while Macnee's first co-star, Ian Hendry, made a guest appearance as a different character in the episode \"To Catch a Rat.\"\n\n==Spin-offs==\n\n===Novels===\nA number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadduck.theavengers.tv/bookshel.htm|title=The Avengers - Official Novelisations|work=theavengers.tv}}</ref> The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. In the UK, Panther books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in 1967. These were reprinted in the US by Berkley Medallion books. After Panther stopped publishing ''Avengers'' novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Emma Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which ''Avengers'' girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, ''Deadline'' and ''Dead Duck'', were reprinted in the UK by [[Titan Books]] in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 & 1996). They were also published in the US for the first time by TV Books in 1998. Titan reissued the books in [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format (with the same covers) to coincide with the release of the feature film ''[[The Avengers (1998 film)|The Avengers]]''.\n\nThe 1990 novel ''Too Many Targets'' by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] featured all of Steed's partners (David Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King) with the exception of Venus Smith and Dr Martin King.\n\n* ''The Avengers'', Douglas Enefer, 1963\n* ''Deadline'', Patrick Macnee and Peter Leslie, 1965\n* ''Dead Duck'', Macnee and Leslie, 1966\n* ''The Floating Game'', John Garforth, 1967\n* ''The Laugh Was on Lazarus'', Garforth, 1967\n* ''The Passing of Gloria Munday'', Garforth, 1967\n* ''Heil Harris!'', Garforth, 1967\n* ''The Afrit Affair'', [[Keith Laumer]], 1968\n* ''The Drowned Queen'', Laumer, 1968\n* ''The Gold Bomb'', Laumer, 1968\n* ''The Magnetic Man'', Norman A.

Both of the Macnee/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as ''Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha'' (deadline) and ''Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto'' (dead duck) by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967/68) (''Heil Harris!'' was not translated for obvious reasons.) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998.

At that point the rights were sold to publishers [[D.C. Thomson & Co.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nOriginally scheduled for May 1, 2020, the film's release was delayed indefinitely due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was now scoring the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' was originally scheduled for release in the United States on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed due the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Widow''''' is an upcoming American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nOriginally scheduled for May 1, 2020, the film's release was delayed indefinitely due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was now scoring the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' was originally scheduled for release in the United States on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed due the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

It likewise has equal control over the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. Finally, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU (it exercises executive powers, but no legislative ones other than legislative initiative), is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council's nominee for the President of the Commission, and it is further tasked with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.<ref name=\"Parliament's powers\"/>\n\nThe [[President of the European Parliament]] (Parliament's [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is [[David Sassoli]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|PD]]), elected in July 2019. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the five largest groups being the [[European People's Party group]] (EPP), the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D), [[Renew Europe]] (previously [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group|ALDE]]), the [[Greens\u2013European Free Alliance|Greens/European Free Alliance]] (Greens\u2013EFA) and [[Identity and Democracy]] (ID). The last union-wide elections were the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 elections]].\n\nThe European Parliament has three places of work&nbsp;\u2013 [[Brussels]] (Belgium), [[Luxembourg City]] (Luxembourg) and [[Strasbourg]] (France).\nLuxembourg City is home to the administrative offices (the \"[[Secretariat of the European Parliament|General Secretariat]]\").

The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in [[Strasbourg]], while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the [[European Council]] in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels.

The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the \"[[ordinary legislative procedure]]\" (previously named \"codecision procedure\"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \"common position\". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an [[absolute majority]], causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a \"Conciliation Committee\" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.<ref name=\"Parliament's powers\">{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate =12 June 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"decision making\">{{cite web|title=Decision-making in the European Union|website=|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=18 September 2007|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040316/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006.<ref name=\"FT CIO\"/>\n\nThe few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy.

Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting){{snd}} for example, when interpreting out of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/> Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/>\n\nWhile some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some.

The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties.<ref name=\":1\" /> In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity.

It likewise has equal control over the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. Finally, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU (it exercises executive powers, but no legislative ones other than legislative initiative), is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council's nominee for the President of the Commission, and it is further tasked with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.<ref name=\"Parliament's powers\"/>\n\nThe [[President of the European Parliament]] (Parliament's [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is [[David Sassoli]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|PD]]), elected in July 2019. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the five largest groups being the [[European People's Party group]] (EPP), the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D), [[Renew Europe]] (previously [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group|ALDE]]), the [[Greens\u2013European Free Alliance|Greens/European Free Alliance]] (Greens\u2013EFA) and [[Identity and Democracy]] (ID). The last union-wide elections were the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 elections]].\n\nThe European Parliament has three places of work&nbsp;\u2013 [[Brussels]] (Belgium), [[Luxembourg City]] (Luxembourg) and [[Strasbourg]] (France).\nLuxembourg City is home to the administrative offices (the \"[[Secretariat of the European Parliament|General Secretariat]]\").

In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \"common position\". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an [[absolute majority]], causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority.

One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the [[European political party|pan-European political parties]] fielded \"candidates\" for [[President of the European Commission|president]] of the [[European Commission|Commission]], the so-called ''Spitzenkandidaten'' (German, \"leading candidates\" or \"top candidates\"). However, European Union governance is based on a mixture of intergovernmental and supranational features: the President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful \"candidate\". The Lisbon Treaty merely states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate. The so-called ''Spitzenkandidaten'' were  [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] for the [[European People's Party]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://juncker.epp.eu|title=Jean-Claude Juncker: Experience. Solidarity.

Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a \"[[Cinderella]] committee\"; however, as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous, attracting increasing attention to its work.<ref name=\"Hoskyns\"/>\n\nThe nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the [[United States Congressional committee|United States Congress]], the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff.

Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting){{snd}} for example, when interpreting out of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/> Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views.

His personality is shown to be aloof, grumpy, and standoffish, but is otherwise loving and courageous. In the first film, while passing through the icy cave, the herd discovers [[cave painting]]s of Manny with his wife and child, who were killed by [[human]]s; this is a very sentimental moment for Manny, since he failed to protect them. Manny finds love with Ellie in ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''. In ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', he is anxious when Ellie is pregnant. At the end of the film, he becomes the proud father of a baby daughter named Peaches. In ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', he gets into an argument with his teenage daughter before being pulled away in by the drift with Diego, Sid and Granny. He and the team later encounter a group of pirates led by Captain Gutt. When the team escaped they destroy the ship and take Shira with them. This enrages the Captain who hunts them down. Later on, he is almost manipulated by [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]].\n\nA running gag for Manny, shown in four of the five films, is that if a certain character were to refer to him as fat, he would often deny it, saying that \"his fur is what makes him look big\" and that \"it's poofy\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sid===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sidney\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[John Leguizamo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Teal\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light yellow\n| alias              = Sid the Sloth\n| species            = [[Megalonyx]]\n| family             = Milton (father)<br>Eunice (mother)<br>Marshall (brother)<br>Fungus (uncle)<br>Granny (grandmother)\n}}\n'''Sidney \"Sid\"''' is a [[Ground Sloth]] in all five films who is dull-witted, talkative, friendly, carefree, [[Naivety|naive]], accident-prone, patient and funny with a caring nature, and is voiced with a [[lateral lisp]]. Little is known from Sid's life other than that Sid once lived in a tree with other sloths that always wanted to leave Sid behind when the migration occurred, using several different ways to leave him behind. What is clear is that Sid's mother always told him that \"bad news is just good news in disguise\" prior to abandoning him for good. He accidentally starts a fire in the first film and learns how to do it properly towards the end; he also shows this skill in the second film, where he is worshiped by a tribe of \"mini-sloths\" who call him \"Fire King\" and try to sacrifice him. In the third film, he adopts a trio of baby T-Rexes, and is forcibly taken to the underground dinosaur land by their mother, requiring the others to come and save him. In the fourth film, it is revealed that his full name is Sidney, though this name was also used in a deleted scene of the first film. When he, Diego and Manny are on the ice and are forced up by a [[Waterspout|water spout]], they see a [[rainbow]] in the bright blue sky as he told them that \"there is a rainbow at the end of every corner.\"\n\nA mechanical version of Sid appears in ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' during the miming scene.\n\nSid was built along the form typical of ground sloths, short, brushy tail, clawed hands and feet, a long thin neck, ovular head with bulbous eye on both sides and a pair of buckteeth. Sid's right front tooth was slightly bigger than the left, similar to his right eye, which was also somewhat bigger than the left, both eyes of which were pale green. Sid's pelt was dirty and tan, and became brown when the fungus it carried dried out, Sid attributing the state of his pelt to his vegetarian diet, which he said led to a younger-looking pelt. In his films, Sid faints at certain times when he's getting hit - e.g. he faints when he gets hit on the nose by a block of ice and apparently get his tongue stuck to the floor of an ice cave.\n\nIn the behind the scenes, the creators combined the traits of [[three-toed sloth]]s and [[ground sloth]]s while designing Sid and the other sloth characters.\n\n===Diego===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Diego\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[Denis Leary]] (films)<br>[[Rick Pasqualone]] (''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (video game)]]'')\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel/green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Orange\n| species            = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n}}\n'''Diego''' is a saber-toothed cat found in all five of the films. He is Shira's love interest. He has a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] personality, although it is not intended to be nasty. He was sent by his pack to retrieve the human baby called Roshan; When he found Roshan in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, when Manny saved his life, Diego had a change of heart, confessing about the pack and sacrifices himself to help them escape. He was seemingly killed by the pack's leader, Soto, but survived and joined Manny and Sid on their travels. In the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown|second film]], he was revealed to suffer from [[aquaphobia]], but he eventually conquered it in order to save Sid, Crash and Eddie. In the third film, he began to fear that he was losing his predatory abilities from being in the \"herd\" too long, and considered staying in the underground dinosaur world with Buck. He changed his mind after managing to save the labored Ellie from a dinosaur attack. In [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]], another ''[[Smilodon]]'' named Shira joins the group, and Diego feels attracted to her. During the end credits, Diego and Shira are seen nuzzling each other showing that they have now become a couple.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ellie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Ellie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = [[Queen Latifah]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light brown\n| spouse             = Manny\n| children           = Peaches (daughter)\n}} \n'''Ellie''' is a female woolly mammoth, whom Manny, Diego, and Sid meet during their migration to escape the flood in the second movie, ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''.\n\nIt was revealed that when Ellie was young, she was separated from her herd during the [[ice age]]. She came across two [[opossums]] named Crash and Eddie, along with their mother. She later forgot her origins and thought that she was an opossum.\n\nInitially Manny was overjoyed that he had found another of his kind, but got somewhat dismayed when he realized that Ellie believed that she was an opossum. Nevertheless, Sid welcomed Ellie and her brothers to travel with them, much to Manny's annoyance. During this time, Ellie displayed the mannerisms pertaining to an opossum as well as insisting (despite obvious proof that she was not a possum) and this tested Manny's patience, namely when she claimed that the act of bravery that he had done of fighting off the sea reptile Cretaceous was dumb.\n\nSoon, Manny got his time to be alone with Ellie when he and Ellie went for a walk through a wooded area, where Ellie had a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that told her of her past. Upon remembering this, she knew that she was a mammoth. When Manny later implied that they must mate in order to save the mammoths from extinction, she was initially angered, but in time she apologized for overreacting.\n\nSoon, however, this new \"herd\" reached a horrible obstacle between them and safety from the oncoming flood: a field of geysers, which Manny explained must be crossed, but Ellie would not listen: she and her brothers felt that they must go around. But this proved to be disastrous: as they were trying to reach their destination, some rocks caved down and nearly crushed Ellie and her brothers, but trapped them instead in a sort of cave. Manny rescued Ellie, for the water was flooding into the cave where she was trapped and had nearly drowned Ellie. She and Manny escaped and regrouped with the others, but faced another problem, for the waters were still rising.\n\nAfter the waters had subsided a herd of mammoths made their way into the valley. Manny thought that because the mammoths had come, that Ellie would not want to remain with him. He was persuaded otherwise by Sid and Diego and confronted Ellie confessing his feelings, saying that he wanted to be together not because they had to be, but because he himself wanted to. Ellie accepted him as her mate. The mammoths trumpet while Manny and Ellie embrace. Manny and Ellie decide to stay with their old friends, taking along Sid, Diego, and the possum brothers.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', she and Manny are mates and Ellie is pregnant with their first child. When they find the Dinosaur World under their feet, they have to go in and search for Sid in Lava Falls. When very close to Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labour, and gives birth to Peaches (which was named after the codeword that was for if Ellie went into labor on the trip). When they reunite with Sid and return to the surface, Ellie introduces Peaches to the herd's new home.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', she is an understanding wife and a mother. Ellie supports Peaches, when she had an argument with Manny. When the Ice Age: Continental Drift happens she aids the herd to the Land Bridge. In the end, she also fights with the Pirates.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Crash and Eddie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Crash and Eddie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = Crash: [[Seann William Scott]] <br>Eddie: [[Josh Peck]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Virginia opossum]]s\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Crash: Blue <br> Eddie: Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark brown striped\n}}\n'''Crash''' and '''Eddie''' are two twin brother opossums. Adoptive brothers of Ellie, they cared for her and taught her to hang by her tail from a tree branch when she slept, as they did. They are shown to be adventurous and fun-loving, courtesy of the fact that they're both very stupid.\n\nThey first made their presence known to the opening characters by means of shooting pebbles through reeds at Sid and Diego, then roasting them so as to humiliate them, but Diego began chasing them, leading both Sid and Diego to Ellie. After Sid invites them to travel with them, Ellie and her brothers agreed, much to the annoyance of Manny.\n\nAs they traveled with Manny and his friends, Ellie grew closer to Manny, putting both Crash and Eddie somewhat closer to Manny and his friends, but creating a short feud when Manny tried \"hitting on\" Ellie. They even play dead when crows are nearby. In time, however, they saw behind the petty grudges and worked together with Manny, Sid, and Diego to escape the flood, but left with Ellie when she left Manny and his friends to cross the minefield, as she claimed that it was suicide to cross it. Crash and Eddie joined Ellie in trying to escape the flood, but soon ran into trouble when they were trapped in a cave.\n\nEllie insisted that they leave her to the point of pushing them outwards from a small crevice, but they promised to return with help, and true to their word, persuaded Manny to try and free Ellie. They eventually made their way into a rushing current of water and were almost swept away when an overzealous Sid came along to jump into the current, leaving them, in addition to holding onto a branch for dear life against the current of water, trying to hold onto an unconscious Sid. Diego eventually helped when he jumped in and saved them from drowning along with Sid. When Manny had saved Ellie from drowning, they helped Ellie back onto solid ground, but almost drowned when the flood was encroaching.\n\nEventually however, the waters drained, leaving Crash, Eddie, and all of the others alive. When a herd of mammoths came by (as mammoths were presumed all but extinct), they thought that Ellie would go with them and leave Manny, so they went with her. But as it turned out, Manny and Ellie stayed together because they wanted to, rather than being obligated to, and so they left onwards with Sid and Diego, as well as Crash and Eddie.\n\nIn the third film, Crash and Eddie travel with the others to the dino jungle to save Sid from Momma, and both grow to idolize Buck, the one-eyed dinosaur-hunting weasel who helped them find Sid. In the third film, they also mentioned they never liked Sid. This is not true however, due to helping Buck save Sid from his incoming death.\n\nOverall, they are very close and almost inseparable as brothers, as shown in the sequels. They are near-on identical: Crash has blue eyes and a flatter nose with ridges, and was voiced by [[Seann William Scott]] while Eddie has brown eyes and a pointier nose with a brown stripe, and was voiced by [[Josh Peck]]. Their mom is Mother Opossum, who first saved Ellie when Crash and Eddie were very small.\n \nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', Crash and Eddie, along with Buck, ride a pterosaur and save Sid from a lava flow heading downwards.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', they have more minor roles than in the previous films but do partake in the final battle with Gutt's crew fighting Dobson by hopping on his back and having a rodeo, but accidentally let him charge into Manny and, later Shira, knocking them onto the other ship.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Peaches===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Peaches\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (2009)\n| voice              = [[Ciara Bravo]] (''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'')<br>[[Keke Palmer]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Light green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Auburn\n| spouse             = Julian\n| family             = Manny (father)<br>Ellie (mother)\n| relatives          = Crash and Eddie (adoptive uncles)\n}}\n'''Peaches''' is the daughter of [[Manny (Ice Age)#Manny|Manny]] and [[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]], born in the Dinosaurs' world whilst they were under attack by a pack of Guanlong. She appeared close to end of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and was named after the code-word that was thought up to say that Ellie was going into labour. Manny also claims that [[peach]]es are sweet, round and fuzzy, just like Peaches and Ellie. She looks exactly like her mother, Ellie (which Sid thinks is very lucky). At the end of the film, she returned to the surface with her parents and the rest of the group. She is voiced by [[Ciara Bravo]] in ''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'' as a kid, and [[Keke Palmer]] in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as a teenager, and also as a young adult in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''.\n\nPeaches appears as a teenager in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''. She is self-taught to do some possum moves just like her mother. Shortly after Scrat sets off a domino effect of the continents breaking apart, she is shown sneaking up in the morning going to the falls with Louis, a molehog who is also her best friend. After Manny embarrasses her in front of Ethan, her crush, and the other mammoths by grounding her, she and her father get into a fight, and as a result, when he, Diego, and Sid get separated from them on an iceberg, she feels not only helpless to stop it but also guilty. Later during the events of the film, it is Ethan who shows an interest in her hanging out with him and his friends. As a kind of condition, he suggests for her to leave Louis behind. Convinced he'd start to like her, she readily agrees. The following day, while walking with Ethan and the other mammoths, unbeknownst to them that Louis was looking for her, they begin to question her about her friendship with him. When she claims to have none so as to gain their approval, Louis overhears, also making himself known. Shortly after Louis leaves, Peaches begins to grow tired of the other mammoths' teasing, as immediately afterwards a tremor causes a dangerous moving cloud of dust, and instead of expressing concern they try to convince her that it was fun escaping the blast. Upon calling them out on their stupid behaviour, Ethan and the others carelessly judge her by her family being part possum, causing her to get upset, confront Ethan, then leave. At the end of the movie, she and her herd are, in part, saved by Louis, who bravely challenges Captain Gutt, and distracts him from Peaches by slamming a chunk of ice on his foot. His bravery, as well as Peaches' own heroics in saving her mother, impress Ethan and his friends, who ask to hang out with them instead. Louis casually agrees.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', Peaches is now a young adult and prepares to marry a male mammoth named Julian.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Granny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Granny\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Wanda Sykes]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Faded purple with scraggly grey scalp hair\n| family             = Milton (son)<br>Fungus (son)<br>Eunice (daughter-in-law)<br>Sid (grandson)<br>Marshall (grandson)\n}}\n'''Granny''' is a Megalonyx and also [[Sid (Ice Age)#Sid|Sid]]'s grandmother. She joins the herd after her own family abandons her, calling her \"dead weight\" to save their own skins before the earthquake (that and to avoid Sid). Despite, how Granny sometimes picks on and berates her grandson, Sid is very happy to have her around. Granny is loud, abrasive, tough, sarcastic, somewhat crazy, as she once thought Gutt was actually being nice to her. Over time she begins to warm up to the group, as Sid asked Granny why their own family abandoned him and Granny; for a moment, Granny sympathetically answers \"because they think we're screw-ups and can't do anything right\". She even helps out in several attempts to get back home. At the end Granny admits that Sid is lucky to have a real family (his herd) that care so much about him. She quickly asks Sid to chew her food, but Sid had fixed her a new set of teeth, a pair of shark teeth that were originally Raz's weapon but Granny uses them quite well as they are very sharp.\n\nIt is shown in the film she had an allegedly imaginary pet named Precious, which showed up at the end and turned out to be real: a giant whale who defeats Gutt's crew (minus Squint) by blasting them away. Precious then helped the group to Switchback Cove and Granny bids her pet a fond good-bye.\n\n===Louis===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Louis\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Josh Gad]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Molehog\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = White, grey brown, and brown\n}}\nPeaches' best friend '''Louis''', is a timid, well-spoken, and cute molehog (a small mammal that lives during the [[ice age]]s. The molehog's name is a portmanteau of [[Mole (animal)|mole]] and [[hedgehog]]), who is always dutifully by her side and eager to help, even if it is to help her get closer to pretty boy Ethan. When Peaches' heart is ultimately broken by Ethan, Louis secretly wishes that she could see that he is the only one who adores her just as she is. Peaches is very oblivious to his crush on her. He tries to be the voice of reason when she is up to some things, because of his soft-spoken demeanor and his somewhat cowardice, Manny alongside Crash and Eddie, have dubbed him \"Wiener\". Even after having his feelings hurt by Peaches, Louis comes to his friends side when she is held hostage by Gutt. He fends off Gutt long enough for Peaches to escape, impressed by his bravery, Manny even encourages Louis to be more open minded to adventures like Peaches. Ethan and his posse even ask to hang out with him, as they seem to move on in life as friends. The only flaw with Louis' life in Ice Age is, along with \"The Brat Pack\", he seems to lack parents and other family members that he would live with.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Shira===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Shira\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Jennifer Lopez]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur Color\n| data3              = White with black stripes\n| lbl4               = Accessories\n| data4              = 2 earrings in each ear, one blue and one green.\n}}\n'''Shira''' appears in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as part of Gutt's crew, and is Captain Gutt's pawn. She is a dazzlingly beautiful, female saber-toothed cat and Diego's lover resembling a [[snow leopard]]. She makes her first appearance in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift#Marketing|Scrat's Continental Crack-up: Part 2]]'' standing next to Captain Gutt, who is holding Scrat.\n\nShira first appears when Gutt's crew attacks the herds \"ship\". Diego is smitten upon his first sight on her as she is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen. Diego, wanting himself, Manny, Sid, and Granny to get back home, tries to chomp off all the pirates' ropes from their \"ship\", but is too late as Shira arrives and restrains him, mocking him for his declaration of \"I don't fight girls\" by pinning him down and saying, \"I can see why\". After Manny and the others escape by capsizing Gutt's iceberg, Shira is seen in the water, calling out for her crewmates' help; only Flynn is concerned over Shira's whereabouts, but Gutt ignores this and demands his crew to move on forward without her. She is rescued against her will by Manny, and is angered when Diego calls her \"Kitty\" for calling them a \"bad joke\" of a herd. She journeyed with the herd to an island. Once there, she attempts to escape, but Diego catches up to her and she is imprisoned in a tree, much to her anger.\n\nThat night, Shira is approached by Diego, who learns she left her pack as he once did. Diego tells her that she simply traded one pack for another, and that his herd always has each other's backs, pointing out that Gutt hadn't made any thoughts of planning a search party for her in the first place. The next morning, Shira escapes and finds Gutt making a new ship on the other side of the island. Gutt angrily berates her for not killing the herd, and punishes her by making Squint his new first mate while she gets demoted. Gutt then orders Shira to target Diego, declaring that he would have a tiger-skin rug when it ended, he didn't care whose (somewhat proving Diego's point to Shira that Gutt never had his back on her or anyone else). When the herd enacts their plans to take Gutt's new ship back home, Shira once again tackles Diego, who convinces her to turn against Gutt and come with him. Because of their newfound love, she follows Diego to the ship, but on seeing that Gutt is catching up to them, secretly puts ice in his way. As the herd floats away, Shira tells Diego that she has his back, while both looking at each other longingly as the boat leaves implying they have feelings for each other.\n\nDuring the return home, Diego realized he had fallen in love with Shira, despite denying it to Manny and Sid. Later, when Gutt is holding Peaches hostage, Shira is seen struggling to get up, implying that Gutt had physically punished Shira for her betrayal. During the fight, she protects Ellie from Squint, mocking the rabbit's \"cute little bunny nose\". After the defeat of Gutt's crew, Shira joins the herd, sharing a loving look with Diego. She also rests her head on Diego's shoulder during the herd's landing on switchback cove. In the end credits, Shira nuzzles against Diego's side showing that they have now become a couple.\n\n===Julian===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Julian\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016)\n| voice              = [[Adam DeVine]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n}}\n'''Julian''' is a young and courageous mammoth who is Peaches' fianc\u00e9 and part-time member of The Herd and The Brat Pack.

He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the main characters, though the two do intersect at times.\n\nIn a special feature in the second film's DVD, his name has been stated to be a mix of the words \"[[squirrel]]\" and \"[[rat]]\", his species allegedly believed to have been a common ancestor of both. In the ''Ice Age'' [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he is referred to as \"The Scrat\" by directors [[Chris Wedge]] and [[Carlos Saldanha]].\n\nScrat is voiced in all ''Ice Age'' movies and short films by director Chris Wedge. He directly interacts with the story's main characters on eight occasions, mostly with Sid. In the first film, he attacks Sid when the latter tries to eat his acorn, successfully regaining it. He later meets Manny, Sid, and Diego asking him where the baby's family is and Scrat attempts to tell them about nearby saber-toothed tigers, but Diego kicks Scrat away before he could do so. At the end of the second film, after Scrat created a hole in the valley and released all the melted ice, later attacks Sid for saving his life (when he had already almost died and gone to paradise and was about to get a giant acorn). In the third film, Scrat is stepped on by Manny and falls onto Sid's head while chasing his acorn. Next, he appears when Sid's \"children\" are batting a ball around, the ball actually being Scrat. Also, when Scratte rips off his fur, he screams so loud the herd can hear him, causing Crash and Eddie to deem the place a \"Jungle of Misery\". Lastly, while Diego is sleeping, he wakes up when he gets hit with Scrat's acorn. In the fourth film, when Sid pries open a clam, he finds Scrat inside. Sid's grandmother mistakes Scrat for a rat and continuously hits him with her cane until he falls into the ocean.\n\nScrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or painful situations: being struck by lightning, pursued by avalanches, and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully \"battles\" Sid.\n\nScrat is the main character in four short films. In the first, ''[[Gone Nutty]]'', he loses his collection of [[acorn]]s in a catastrophic chain of events. He jams his acorn into a hole in the middle of the collection, which shatters the pile and with it the entire continent - which begins the [[continental drift]].\n\nIn the second film, ''[[No Time for Nuts]]'', Scrat finds a [[time travel|time machine]] left by a time-traveler and visits several historical events. He becomes trapped in a frightening future when oak trees have become extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period.\n\nA third Scrat short, ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'', was released in 2010 accompanying the feature ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'', and later with ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' as a promotion for the fourth Ice Age movie ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].''<ref>{{cite news |title=Swift injustice |first=James |last=Verniere |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330&position=also |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2010-12-25 |accessdate=2 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226092036/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330 |archive-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA fourth and most recent short film, ''[[Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe]]'', was released in 2015 preceding ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''.\n\nScrat has a cameo in ''[[Surviving Sid]]'', that is important to the plot.\n\nScrat is the main character in the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown#Video game|''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' video game]].

Cartoon designer [[Ivy Supersonic]] claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in [[Skidmore College]]'s Case Green. She called her character \"Sqrat\" and says she presented the idea to 20th Century Fox movie executives. A CNN report by Jeanne Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development.

In a desperate attempt to save her son, leaps over the waterfall, holding the baby tightly in her arms. They are both found by Manny and Sid at the riverside. Using what little strength she has left, she gives the baby to Manny and Sid in hopes that he will be safe with them.\n\nRoshan's primary care-provider is Sid, the only member of the group who initially has concern for him, Manny being too disillusioned to care and Diego secretly planning to kill him.

Diego fails at this task, leaving Soto furious, telling Diego to bring Roshan to Half-Peak where he would meet with the others and threatens have him served as a replacement if he fails. Soto dispatched his fellow pack members Zeke and Oscar to warn Diego to hurry and bring Roshan or not return at all, though was reciprocated with the news that alongside Roshan, Soto would receive a mammoth.\n\nSoto eventually made it with his pack to Half Peak and informed Diego that while he had his doubts, he was pleased that Diego had made it. Soon it would happen that unbeknownst to Soto, Diego was in league with both Manny and Sid, and so Sid would lure Soto and his pack-mates away from both Manny and Roshan with a decoy made of snow.\n\nSoto fought viciously in the altercation in which he made an attempt to kill Manny, but was stopped by the now-reformed Diego, whom he severely maimed.

Zeke accompanied Oscar to tell Diego to hurry up and bring back Roshan or not to come back. Diego had him inform Soto that there will be a mammoth traveling with the baby as well. He soon made it along with the rest of his pack to Half Peak, where he tried to kill Sid and Roshan, but was outwitted by Sid who stomped him into a tiny crevice with his hindquarters sticking out. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards.\n\n====Oscar====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Oscar\n| voice              = [[Diedrich Bader]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light Brown\n}}\n'''Oscar''' is a tall Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nOscar is shown to doubting Diego's abilities because he messed up once in bringing Roshan to Soto. In a deleted scene, he is seen telling his packmates of his disapproval of Soto's plans to stay and hunt the humans instead of following the migrating herds traveling south. Oscar went along with Zeke to find Diego and warn him to hurry and bring Roshan. Oscar made it with the rest of the pack to Half Peak where he attempted to kill Manny but was defeated along with the others. He is last seen running away after he and Lenny see Soto killed by Manny, leaving him and Lenny's fates unknown.\n\n====Lenny====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Lenny\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Homotherium]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light Brown\n}}\n'''Lenny''' is a rotund Homotherium and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nLenny, along with the rest of the pack, attacked the human encampment but were fended off by the humans' dogs who fought alongside the humans against the pack sending them off. One of the pack members Diego was expected to steal the baby Roshan from the humans but missed his chance when Roshan's mother Nadia escaped with her child through a waterfall. Bitter at Diego's failure the pack leader Soto orders Diego to retrieve Roshan and bring him to Half Peak where the others will be waiting. Soto was later informed by other pack members Zeke and Oscar that Diego will bring Roshan back along with a wooly Mammoth called Manny who has been caring for Roshan along with Sid the sloth.\n\nLenny met up with Diego along with the other members of the pack at Half Peak where Zeke reminisced the joys of mammoth flesh much to Lenny's displeasure (saying his only lines in the film, \"Hey, knock it off. I'm starving!\" and \"I told you to knock it off!\"). He then demanded Zeke to stop talking about food and then tries to strike him but is stopped by Soto who tells him to save energy as mammoths don't go down easily. Soto plans an ambush on Manny so he would be caught by surprise and so he ordered the pack not to attack until they saw Manny but Diego secretly turned on his pack after he had been shown real friendship and appreciation from Manny and Sid so he tempted Zeke to leap into action and attack. The surprise given away, the pack pursue Sid as he slides down a snowy slope on a piece of bark soon after Lenny and Oscar who had been chasing Sid where hit by a large log Manny threw at them. Once they recovered they saw that Soto had been killed when he tried to attack Manny and that Diego had thwarted Soto's attacks. Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice and a number of icicles fall down and kill him. Seeing the death of their leader, Lenny and Oscar run off. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards.\n\nUnlike the rest of his pack who are all [[saber-toothed cat]]s, Lenny is a [[Homotherium|scimitar-toothed cat]] as stated in the book ''Ice Age: The Essential Guide''.\n\n===Runar===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Runar\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Nadia (deceased)\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Runar''' was the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of the Neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nRunar was a leader for a tribe of Neanderthals (referred in the film as humans). He was the father of Roshan and husband of Nadia, and cared greatly for his family, all the while leading them and the rest of the tribe as a nomadic group to travel from place to place. In one encampment that his tribe set up, half a pack of saber-toothed tigers was killed and the furs taken as coats and clothing. In vengeance, the leader saber-tooth named Soto decided to plan an attack on Runar's tribe so as to take his son Roshan and kill him in vengeance for those saber-teeth slain in battle by Runar's tribe. The attack almost worked, but Runar's tribe had trained [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]] that detected Soto's pack coming and alerted the human tribe to battle the saber-teeth, with Soto fighting directly with Runar while the rest of the tribe fought the other saber-tooth tigers and unleash their wolves to help. In the melee, the baby Roshan was taken by his mother from a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and the hunters successfully warded off the saber-teeth. Runar tried to help his wife and son, but is stopped by Soto and Oscar. After the fight, he finds out that his son and wife had disappeared.\n\nRunar had no choice left but to begin the travel to another camp far off, tracking the dangerous saber-teeth on the way and finding clues as to his son's whereabouts. In time, Runar made it near the settlement and was finally re-united with his son, but not before meeting face-to-face with Manny and Sid, the two animals who returned the child. Runar was on his guard about Manny at first, as he appeared violent while his tribe quickly rush in to attack Manny and Sid. Upon seeing Roshen, he quickly came to see that they meant no harm, simply to return his child and stopped his tribe from attacking them.\n\nRunar thanked Manny by giving him the charm bracelet that had once been Roshan's, and after letting his son say goodbye to Manny and Sid, Runar left the scene with his tribe and his son in tow.\n\n===Nadia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Nadia\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Runar\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Nadia''' was the wife of the chieftain of a neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nNadia had a husband, Runar, and a baby son, Roshan. She and her family lived a peaceful life together with their tribe until the day when a pack of saber-toothed tigers invaded their camp to abduct the youngest member, Roshan in revenge for the tribe killing half of their pack. Nadia fended off an attack on Roshan long enough to run away quickly from Diego who was pursuing her. Nadia ran with Roshan in her arms until she reached a high waterfall and was cornered. She jumped, holding on tightly to her son all the while; she then ended up on the riverbank below, meeting Manny and Sid, two animals that were passing by. With the last of her strength, Nadia nudged Roshan to these animals in the hopes that they could be entrusted with her son. Seconds after this act, she slipped slowly from the riverbank, disappearing. Her fate remains unknown, although it is heavily implied that she may have drowned.\n\n===The Dodo Birds===\nThese '''[[Dodo]]s''' are portrayed as greedy for [[watermelon]]s claiming it to be their private stockpile for the ice age. All these dodos hate to be extinct. Some appear to be military marching. Trying to get a watermelon from Sid, Diego and Manny who try to ask for it for the baby's hunger, some of these dodos accidentally fall to where they tossed the melon. Four of these fall into the pit to [[death by burning|burn to death]] as one warns a few, where another melon is also incinerated. The rest are defeated by Sid who protects the last melon from them by getting through them.\n\n====Dab====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dab\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Dodo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Feathers\n| data3              = Powder blue\n}}\n'''Dab''' was the head [[dodo]] shown in the first film.\n\nThe dodos were collecting a stockpile for the winter, and one of them stole the melon that Manny had spotted for Roshan. When Manny, Sid and Diego went to the dodos to get the melon back, they found the dodos on parade. The dodos' stockpile so far consisted only of three melons, including the stolen melon. After Manny pointed this out, the dodos fought to stop Manny, Diego and Sid getting at the melons. In the fight, the first melon fell over a cliff and several dodos, including the flock's \"last female\", jumped over as well in a [[suicide|suicid]]al attempt to retrieve it. The second melon bounced into a boiling [[tar pit]], along with three more unfortunate dodos who were trying to stop it falling in. Sid managed to get the last melon, and the remaining dodos also fell off the cliff, a parody as to why they are extinct today. In ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'', another dodo gets fried while attempting to cross the geyser fields and in the epilogue of the sequel, there is a dodo choir singing angelically as Scrat enters heaven. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Carl and Frank===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Carl and Frank\n| voice              = Carl: [[Cedric the Entertainer]]<br>Frank: [[Stephen Root]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Carl: ''[[Embolotherium]]''<br>Frank: ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Skin\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Carl''' and '''Frank''' are an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' and a ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]'' respectively. Carl had thick lips and a thick horn, while Frank had more pointed lips and a thinner horn. They referred to Sid as an overgrown weasel.\n\nThe two appeared at the beginning of the film when Sid the [[ground sloth]] was shown stepping on their salad and eating an important part of it, the [[dandelion]]. The two animals soon chased after him in the hopes of killing him, but were stopped forcefully by Manny the mammoth, by being hurled through the air. They'd held a powerful grudge against Sid for what he'd done and when they next saw him, he was in the same hot mud pool that they were in and was erroneously referring to them as ladies. Again, Carl and Frank stampeded after the hapless sloth, but were waylaid when they saw that he had already been \"killed\" by a saber-toothed cat named Diego (which was part of Sid's plan to get them to be fooled into leaving him alone and not trying to kill him off) and gave up their chase post-haste stating that \"carnivores have all the fun.\" Carl and Frank aren't seen again after this.\n\n===Jennifer and Rachel===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jennifer and Rachel\n| voice              = Jennifer: [[Lorri Bagley]]<br>Rachel: [[Jane Krakowski]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Jennifer: [[Blue]]<br>Rachel: [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Jennifer: [[Violet (color)|Violet]] with [[black]] hair<br>Rachel: [[Pink]] with [[blond]] hair\n}}\n'''Jennifer''' and '''Rachel''' are two ''Megalonyx'' from the first film.\n\nThe two were shown being sweet-talked by Sid to impress them while he had the baby Roshan in tow. Jennifer admitted that she found some of Sid's qualities to be most attractive, and when Sid left, the two spoke to each other on how, despite his lack of good looks, he was a family-type.\n\nThese two female sloths (in a deleted scene from the film) were shown scorning Sid when he was shown to simply be using the baby to mate with them, though Rachel was much more straightforward as she kicked him directly in the groin while calling him \"''pig''\".\n\nJennifer was a thickset dark-blue sloth with short curly hair and a medium-sized nose. Rachel was considerably thinner and had light tan fur and a blonde ponytail directly at the top of her head and a smaller nose.\n\n===Sylvia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sylvia\n| voice              = [[Kristen Johnston]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = [[Red]] with red hair\n}}\n'''Sylvia''' is a female Megalonyx who was cut from the first film, but can be found in the deleted scenes of the 2-Disc DVD release as well as the film-to-book adaptation.\n\nSylvia wanted Sid to travel with her, for she was seeking commitment. Sid, not wanting any of this, put her in the path of some running glyptodonts to send her off. Sylvia eventually found him again, and was still adamant to go migrating with him. Sid tricked her into thinking that he was getting turnips for their migration, and then ran off to escape, but she followed him into the jaws of Diego, the saber-toothed cat. She did not believe that Sid was truly dead, and sullenly told Diego to \"eat him\". It is presumed that after that, she left Sid alone. Sylvia had red-colored fur, green eyes and a small nose.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentaries, Sylvia was cut because the scriptwriters felt that Sid's behavior towards her made him too unlikable, and that her scenes detracted from the film's main plot. Additionally, the first movie had a different ending planned out. Sid and Manny headed south without Diego (due to his death, which was changed) and met up with the other animals. Sid had matured after witnessing Diego's death, and upon seeing Sylvia for the third time, was nicer to her, even asking her to be his mate.\n\nSylvia was cut from the movie fairly late. Most of her scenes were completely animated and rendered, and she was seen in the first few trailers of the movie as well as the initial posters.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: The Meltdown''==\n\n===Fast Tony===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Fast Tony\n| voice              = [[Jay Leno]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Holmesina]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| data3              = Blue-gray\n| lbl4               = Skin\n| data4              = Peach\n}}\nA [[Holmesina]] living in the days of the Ice Age, '''Fast Tony''' was a [[peddler]] trying to give off items such as reeds and bark to other denizens of the Ice Age so as to escape the world's end, which by chance, he predicted and it came true. Fast Tony would give off products in exchange for whatever the other animals would bring by with the help of his \"''assistant''\", an insipid [[glyptodon]] named Stu. He was notoriously amoral with others, even being criticized by Manny for willing to sell off ''\"his own mother for a [[grape]]\"''. Fast Tony immediately asked if that was an offer, then pretended he had not thought of it for the benefit of the watching animals.\n\nStu was more Fast Tony's guinea pig to prove their wares' worth, rather than his actual partner and proved more useful dead than alive, as Fast Tony had taken Stu's shell (as Stu had just been killed by Maelstrom and Cretaceous) and shamelessly tried to pawn it off to other animals as a personal \"''mobile home''\".\n\nFast Tony was last seen at the end of ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' using Stu's shell as a raft.\n\n====Stu====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Stu\n| voice              = [[Tom Fahn]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Glyptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| lbl4               = Skin\n}}\n'''Stu''' was a ''Glyptodon'' who was Fast Tony's partner. He seemed to be disliked by Tony due to his stupid personality. He assisted Fast Tony to warn the valley that the dam of ice would burst and helped to demonstrate Fast Tony's snorkel. After the revelation of the flood was proved to be true, Stu took the test snorkel and used it to swim underwater. Shortly after scaring James, a young anteater, Stu was grabbed and pulled underwater by an unknown attacker. As the other animals begin to leave, Fast Tony returns to the pool to get Stu to come along, but Stu's shell is suddenly spat out of the water by the unknown assailant. Fast Tony, after looking at the shell, sees that it makes a great mobile home and runs off after the other animals to try and unload it on someone. Meanwhile, the unknown attackers turn out to be the marine reptiles Cretaceous and Maelstrom. In the ending after the flood, Fast Tony is discovered to have been using the shell as a boat, but he leaves the shell behind as he no longer needs it. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Start===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Mr. and Mrs. Start\n| voice              = Mr. Start: [[Joseph Bologna]]<br>Mrs. Start: [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Palaeotherium|Start]]\n}}\n'''Mr. and Mrs. Start''' are two Starts that are shown resting at the Glacier Water Park where they complain about the heat.

The Lone Gunslinger only warns them of the danger and little else, rather hoping that one or two of the animals leaving will die, furnishing food for him and the other vultures which he is presumably family and friends with.\n\nAs he watches all of the creatures in the valley leave to safety, he makes cryptic statements with his Teratornis friends about it and this escalades to the point of singing a musical number on how much they plotted to eat the other animals.\n\nThe Lone Gunslinger was last shown flying over the \"boat\" full of escaping animals and making provocative remarks.\n\nIn the storybook version, he and his fellow Teratornis were shown to be feasting on Cretaceous and Maelstrom's corpses.\n\n===Cretaceous===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Cretaceous\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Cymbospondylus]]<ref name=\"TEG\">''Ice Age: The Essential Guide''</ref>{{rp|39}}\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Yellow with red pupils\n| lbl3               = Scales\n| data3              = Iris (purple-blue)\n}}\n'''Cretaceous''' is an [[Cymbospondylus]].

The two sea reptiles then swam further down the series of rivers where they eventually reached Manny's herd as well as Crash, Eddie, and Ellie. Cretaceous made a great lunge at Manny, but was caught on his tusks, only to be flung far off, hitting a piece of ice and falling back into the water.\n\nLater, when the dam broke, the two reptiles went swimming on the wall of water that was slowly approaching towards the escaping masses and pulled down Manny when he was swimming to save Ellie.

Angry that something had attempted to take his acorn. Scrat seized another piranha and used it to hit at others, fighting and kicking the fish away, stunning them all.

She is equally determined in catching the acorn and uses her feminine wiles to her advantage. She doesn't, however, seem to be nearly as obsessed with acorns as her male counterpart, as she was shown trying to destroy the acorn at the end of the film out of jealousy. Scratte will often injure and manipulate Scrat in the process of retrieving it. However, her attraction to him is implied and fully emerged when he saved her from falling into lava.\n\nIn the fourth movie, Scratte appeared again in a cameo role as a Siren only to then be dismissed by a disinterested Scrat. In addition, tons of her species live on Scratlantis.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a384507/ice-age-4-continental-drift-releases-new-trailer-video.html|title='Ice Age 4: Continental Drift' releases new trailer - video|author= Simon Reynolds|work=Digital Spy|date= May 30, 2012|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Buck===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Buck\n| voice              = [[Simon Pegg]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Weasel]]\n| lbl2               = Eye\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Brownish-red with spots\n}}\n'''Buck''' (short for '''Buckminster''') is a weasel that makes an appearance in ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]''. He is missing his right eye and wears a leaf as an [[impromptu]] [[eyepatch]], as well as having a scar on one of his ears and seems slightly insane (he claims that he woke up one day, married to an ugly pineapple, but he still loved \"her\",<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Hara| first = Helen| title = Simon Pegg Freezes Over| url = http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=24483| work = [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]| date = 27 March 2009| accessdate = 28 March 2009}}</ref> and Manny calls him a \"deranged hermit.\" He also claims to have sadly been \"killed by Rudy,\" although he was not). According to the official website, Buck is one-eyed and relentless in his hunting for dinosaurs. Buck's archenemy is a large albino ''[[Baryonyx]]'' he calls Rudy, who gouged out Buck's eye and attempted to eat him, but failed after Buck grabbed onto to Rudy's uvula, swung on it, and then let go, knocking out Rudy's teeth, which he kept and later sharpened into a knife that he carries with him. Buck is the only inhabitant of the dinosaurs' world who does not fear Rudy in the slightest, though he possesses a deep respect for him. Due to living underground for so long, he has an extensive knowledge of the dangers of the dinosaur world.\n\nBuck first meets Manny, Crash, Eddie, Diego, and Ellie (who he at one point refers to as \"preggers\") after they descend into the jungle in pursuit of Sid and Momma, and saves them from a dinosaur attack. He has been living in the jungle for quite some time, persistently hunting Rudy to avenge the loss of his eye, and agrees to lead them to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid, and rescues him after taking control of a ''[[Harpactognathus]]''.\n\nAfter Rudy's potential death, Buck, having lost his purpose in life, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. Upon hearing a distant familiar roar that tells him that Rudy survived the fall, he chooses to stay and causes a cave-in that seals off the path between the surface and the underground jungle, trapping him inside and everyone else on the surface. He and Rudy proceed to continue their battle.\n\nBuck and Rudy make brief cameos in ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'' and ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' when Scrat falls through the Earth and passes them.\n\nHe returns to help the herd with an ancient stone pillar and rejoins them to stop the asteroid in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' while being pursued by a family of Dino-Birds.\n\nDue to his voice actor, Buck speaks with a British accent.\n\n===Momma===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Momma\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Scales\n| data3              = Red-violet with an orange face and yellow belly\n}}\n'''Momma''' was a female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She took Sid from his herd when he took her eggs from her. She brings Sid to Lava Falls and the two compete to see who can care for her babies better. Sid loses, but is allowed to stay. However, they are separated later and Sid is attacked by Rudy. She is also called Momzilla by Sid.\n\nMomma later returns when Manny, Ellie, Diego, Sid, Crash, Eddie, and Buck are under attack by Rudy and knocks Rudy off a cliff to his apparent death proceeding to bid Sid farewell.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rudy===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Rudy\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Baryonyx]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Red with yellow pupils\n| lbl3               = Scales\n| data3              = White\n}}\n'''Rudy''' was a gigantic albino ''[[Baryonyx]]'' and the main antagonist of the third film who is feared by all the creatures in the valley except Buck and Momma. When Buck first arrived in the jungle, he was attacked by Rudy, who scratched him in the right eye, thus poking it out, and very nearly devoured him. Buck escaped, knocking out one of Rudy's teeth in the process. Rudy appears to have held a grudge ever since, especially since the impact left behind a crack in his mouth which prevented any new teeth from growing. (Note: Rudy is constantly mistaken for a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and although he has features of both species, the filmmakers have directly stated he is a ''Baryonyx''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}) Rudy first appears when he attacks Sid and chases him onto a rock floating over Lava Falls, and later attacks Sid and company full force as they are about to exit the jungle. The group quickly proves to be no match for the ''Baryonyx'', but are saved by Momma, who knocks him off of a cliff. Rudy survives, however, and he and Buck continue their eternal war. Rudy is last seen roaring in frustration as Buck is riding on top of the massive dinosaur laughing, as Rudy runs through the jungle.\n\nBuck and Rudy made a brief cameo in the following film ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''.\n\n===Johnny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Johnny\n| voice              = [[Christian Pikes]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Aardvark]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Reddish-brown\n}}\n'''Johnny''' is a young aardvark who is swallowed whole and alive by Egbert. Johnny's mother demands that Sid, currently posing as the young dinosaurs' father orders the dinosaur to return her son or else they will leave the playground. Johnny was not found just then; instead a young ''[[Gastornis]]'', named Madison, is brought up. But then Manny and Ellie come by. Egbert got scared, and immediately regurgitated Johnny. His mother promptly drags him off. He is referred to by Sid and his mother as \"Little Johnny\".\n\n===Johnny's Mother===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Unknown\n| voice              = [[Maile Flanagan]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Aardvark]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Reddish-brown\n}}\nThe '''unnamed mother''' of Johnny. She looked on in horror when Egbert tried to eat little Johnny. She later demanded that Sid tell Egbert to spit her son out.

She was among the village of animals that reacted to Ellie's false alarm of her pregnancy. When Sid commented on the beaver mom's pregnancy, the beaver mom angrily tells Sid that she is not pregnant and snapped a stick to hit Sid with it. When the beaver mom's young child ventured into the playground that Manny had built, she called out Sid over the fact that the three ''Tyrannosaurus'' children were picking on her child. Sid tells her that he's a single parent.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Egbert, Yoko, and Shelly===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Egbert, Yoko and Shelly\n| voice              = [[Carlos Saldanha]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue and orange\n| lbl3               = Scales\n| data3              = Orange, red-orange, yellow-orange and pink\n}}\nThese baby dinosaurs are three baby ''Tyrannosaurus'' from ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', consisting of two males ('''Egbert''' and '''Yoko'''), and one female ('''Shelly'''). Sid took them away from their [[List of Ice Age characters#Momma|mother]], but she came searching for them and took Sid away with them, then she later became friends with Sid at the end of the movie. They are very friendly dinosaurs, but due to being carnivores, they go too far in playing with other animals which eventually winds up with one of them eating a couple of the kids. Despite knowing that Sid isn't their real father, they still loved and care for him to a point of protecting him from their angry mother. They are later returned to their [[List of Ice Age characters#Momma|mother]] at the end of [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]].\n\n===Roger===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Roger\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Harpactognathus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Red with yellow sclerae\n| lbl3               = Skin\n| data3              = Green and pinkish\n}}\nRoger is a ''[[Harpactognathus]]'' who was used by Buck, along with Crash and Eddie, to go to the Lava Falls to rescue Sid from Rudy. During the attempt, they were attacked by a flock of ''[[Cearadactylus]]'', but they managed to evade them and rescue Sid in time. After returning to the Plates of Woe, the pterosaur flew away after Buck asked if it had \"ever thought of settling down and starting a family\".\n\nRoger's gender is unspecified in the film, but it is referred to as a female in the video game adaption.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Other dinosaurs===\nAmong the other dinosaurs that live in the underground valley are ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' (which is depicted with a long neck like a ''[[Miragaia longicollum]]''), ''[[Iguanodon]]'', ''[[Troodon]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'', ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''[[Guanlong]]'' and the [[pterosaur]]s ''[[Harpactognathus]]'' and ''[[Cearadactylus]]'' (the filmmakers refer to them as \"[[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]]\" and \"pterosaur\" respectively). Also, the ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' appears in the video game adaption where it has the same description as the version seen in the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' franchise.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: Continental Drift''==\n\n===Captain Gutt's Pirates===\nA group of pirates that sailed the seas. Among its members are:\n\n====Captain Gutt====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Captain Gutt\n| voice              = [[Peter Dinklage]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Brown and Gray\n}}\n\n{{Overly detailed|date=July 2016|section=yes}}\n\n'''Gutt''' is a ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'' who is a self-styled master and [[Piracy|pirate]] captain of the high seas. His name is based on the long sharpened fingernails that he uses to \"[[disembowelment|gut]]\" his enemies. He is the main antagonist of the fourth film. He captures Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, and Granny and attempts to make them part of his crew. His friendly demeanor quickly vanishes when Manny refuses; he throws the mammoth and his friends overboard, and furiously vows revenge when they destroy his ship and bounty during their escape.\n\nGutt enslaves a population of hyraxes to build a new ship for him, and also strips Shira of her rank as first mate when she reveals she did not attack Manny, giving her position to Squint. Gutt leads his crew to battle against the unenslaved hyraxes, only for the hyraxes to be revealed as a distraction while Manny steals his new ship. Enraged, Gutt quickly forges a new ship out of a wall of ice, propelled by his legion of [[narwhal]]s. Gutt arrives at Manny's home, and takes Ellie, Peaches, and the other animals hostage.\n\nManny turns himself in to free his wife and daughter, but Gutt goes back on his word, stating that Manny took everything he had from him and the evil captain intended to do the same. However, the timely arrival of Louis, Peaches' friend, sparks a fierce battle between the pirates and Manny's herd. Gutt tries to fight Manny along with Raz, but Diego fights Gutt himself. Gutt chases Diego up a tree on the herd's ship, and knocks the sabertooth down with the rest of herd. Gutt corners the herd, but he and his pirates are defeated by Granny's pet whale Precious.\n\nGutt is swift enough to dodge Precious' blasts while Squint, Raz, Flynn, Dobson, Silas, and Gupta are knocked onto the side of their ship and into the sea; Gutt escapes and leaves his crew behind. He is about to kill Ellie when Peaches knocks him onto the back of the ice. He then leaps at Manny and refuses to let him return to his family. A new landmass emerges and launches the iceberg that the two are standing on into the air.\n\nGutt battles Manny with his two swords, stating that \"the sea isn't big enough\" for the two of them. Manny charges into Gutt, knocking him down, but Gutt is able to push the mammoth off of him. Manny charges again, but Gutt swings on a number of vines to catch up to the floe; Manny follows. Gutt pushes Manny onto the front of the floe and grabs a log to finish him off, but Manny jumps onto the back of the floe, which launches Gutt off the floe. Manny catches the log and hits Gutt, sending the evil ape flying out of fight.\n\nHe lands in a cave river and grabs a piece of ice to float on the water; he notices fins sticking out of the water, and is shortly after eaten offscreen by a siren posing as a female ''Gigantopithecus''.\n\n'''Note''': [[Jeremy Renner]] was originally set to voice the character, but was replaced by [[Peter Dinklage]] due scheduling conflicts involving ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]''. Captain Gutt was initially written as a [[bear]], but designer Peter DeS\u00e8ve had a hard time designing an ursine villain, and thus instead designed him as a more versatile primate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Flynn====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Flynn\n| voice              = [[Nick Frost]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Elephant seal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Flynn''' is a large English [[elephant seal]] (appearing to be just as big as or even bigger than Manny in the film) who makes his first appearance in [[Scrat's Continental Crack-up|the second part of Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]. His lack of intelligence is the source of comic relief throughout the film. Flynn likes to eat [[fruit]], and calls the song titled \"Master of the Seas\" a [[sea shanty]]. When the pirates first encounter Manny's herd, Flynn inadvertently gives them directions to return to the continent, much to Gutt's exasperation. The seal then joined the attack on the herd, squashing Sid underneath his bulk. When Manny's herd destroys the ship, leaving the pirates to drift at sea, Flynn initially panics at the prospect of [[drowning]], but is reminded by an annoyed Gutt that he is able to swim. Flynn worries about Shira when Gutt leaves her for dead, but he later propels the pirates to land aboard a small raft made of ice.\n\nIn the final battle, Flynn and Gupta corner Sid and Granny, only for the latter to summon Precious, sending the pirates running in fear. Flynn rejoins the battle against Manny, but is defeated when Precious blasts him with water.\n\n====Raz====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Raz\n| voice              = [[Rebel Wilson]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Procoptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Grayish white with Violet stripes\n}}\n'''Raz''' is an Australian ''[[Procoptodon]]'' who serves as the crew's resident weapons and artillery expert, hiding an arsenal of deadly bone swords in her pouch and using her powerful legs to launch projectiles at enemies by kicking them.\n\nIn the final melee against Manny's herd, she battles Manny herself, until she is blasted away by Precious.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Silas====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Silas\n| voice              = [[Alain Chabat]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Petrel]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Feather colour\n| data3              = Grey, with blue feet\n}}\n'''Silas''' is a [[petrel]] from the south of France with the feet of a [[blue-footed booby]] who usually scouts out for trouble ahead of the pirates. Silas informs Captain Gutt of Manny and his herd's presence, claiming that their raft was a huge bounty ripe for the taking. Silas later attacks Manny personally while the mammoth is escaping the hyrax island, but Manny bats him away with his trunk.\n\nIn the final battle, Silas launches Gupta at Manny's face to distract him.\n\n====Squint====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Squint\n| voice              = [[Aziz Ansari]] (''Continental Drift'')<br>[[Seth Green]] (''The Great Egg-Scapade'')\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Palaeolagus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Grayish White\n}}\n'''Squint''' is a ''[[Palaeolagus]]''. He makes his first appearance in [[Scrat's Continental Crack-up|the second part of Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]. He is overconfident, somewhat psychotic, and dislikes being called adorable; he is berated many times by Gutt and Shira for trying to assume authority over the crew. Squint holds a rivalry with Shira, which reaches its climax when Squint becomes Gutt's new first mate after Gutt insults Shira for failing to kill Manny and his herd.\n\nIn the final battle, Squint attempts to attack Shira as she is trying to free Ellie, but Shira mocks Squint's 'adorable nose', which agitates him and allows Ellie to stomp on him.\n\nSquint later resurfaces in ''[[Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade]]'' where Squint wanted revenge on the Herd.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Dobson====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dobson\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Metridiochoerus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Red/Violet & Brownish Gray\n}}\n'''Dobson''' is a ''[[Metridiochoerus]]'', who speaks in growls, oinks, and other pig noises (although he appeared to be singing along with the crew in the \"Master of the Seas\" musical sequence). He teams up with Raz in firing the cannons, loading them with chunks of ice for Raz to fire with her powerful kangaroo legs, and leaps down onto the heroes's ship with her to corner Manny. Dobson later takes part in the final battle, fighting Crash and Eddie \"rodeo-style\", and is able to charge into Manny and knock him into the other ship along with Shira.

In the climax of the film, Gupta and Flynn corner Sid and Granny, but are scared off by Granny's pet whale Precious.

He is a thrill-loving teenager who is openminded to Peaches being part of his group, and may have returned her affections. But he is shown to be shallow when he tells Peaches to stop hanging around Louis. When Peaches sees she has hurt her friend's feelings, and that Ethan and his group are lacking in common sense, she decides to leave. Ethan rudely remarks that \"it's bad enough her family is half-possum\", angering Peaches. Ethan, unlike his posse, seems to be at least partially rational, and might have felt guilt from hurting Peaches' feelings.\n\nAfter Louis helps to save Peaches, Ethan and his group are impressed by his bravery.

She is not a good mother and tends to bump Marshall aside when he gets in her way.\n* '''Marshall''' - Sid's 20-year-old brother with a dwarfish appearance.\n* '''Uncle Fungus''' - Sid's hygienically-challenged uncle who sports moss and fungus on his fur.\n\nThey dump their eighty-year-old Granny for Sid to take care of. Believing something was happening, the family left the land; shortly thereafter, the Pangaea supercontinent begun to fragment.\n\nDespite how his family had abandoned him, Sid was very enthusiastic to see them and still loved them. Eunice seemed to care for her son, as she said she was worried about him when they were separated. When Sid replies that he thought they abandoned him, Marshall replies coldly that they did, but Eunice insists they were still worried about him and prompts her husband to insist they did. However, when Eunice instructed Sid to show Granny around, she quickly shows herself to be as cruel as the rest of Sid's family, who leave hastily without looking back.

Precious was the pet of a ground sloth named Granny; Granny's family, especially Marshall, thought her senile for talking on about her \"dead pet\". But Precious was alive and had grown to an enormous size. When Granny, along with her grandson Sid and his friends Manny and Diego, were confronted at a cliff overhanging the ocean by a number of pirates, Granny called Precious, who rose up out of the water, opened her mouth, and allowed Granny to walk in along with Sid (who was disgusted at the smell inside the whale). Later, Granny and Sid use her like a submarine to fight with the pirates.\n\nLarge, even for a whale, Precious was the beloved pet of Granny, who was always seen throwing food into the ocean when she was near it. Precious was loyal to Granny, such that Granny could step inside the whale's mouth and commandeer her like a submarine. Her blowhole was shown as being capable of delivering a nasty attack to the pirates, and she was able to swallow Manny to prevent him from falling in the sea.\n\n===Hyraxes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Hyraxes\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Hyrax]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Varying\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Varying\n}}\n'''Hyraxes''' have only been seen in ''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' and ''Ice Age: Collision Course''.\n\nThey are first seen being forced to work as slaves by Captain Gutt, as they are used to load Gutt's treasure onboard and are even used to swab the deck as part of a mop.\n \nManny, Sid and Diego encounter the hyraxes that were not enslaved during a short trek on a deserted island in the jungle. Though somewhat wary of the visitors, the hyraxes quickly warm up to the Sub-Zero Heroes. Manny feels that, if the hyraxes helped them, they could defeat the pirates; unfortunately, the hyraxes are unable to comprehend English and misinterpret Manny's request as asking for food. Eventually, Sid is able to communicate to them that an alliance is necessary if the other hyraxes are to be freed and the pirates are to be defeated, much to the surprise of Manny and Diego. The lead hyrax (distinguished by his bushy eyebrows, lighter fur coloration, and lower voice tone), who hates Gutt with a passion, rallies his forces and decides to help the herd, much to the herd's delight.\n \nDuring the attack on the pirates, the lead hyrax spearheads a cavalry attack, followed by a dive bombing rescue, which is a diversion used to trick the pirates into leaving the slave hyraxes and their ship unguarded while the herd frees the captives and overtakes the ship. The enslaved hyraxes take an immense liking to Diego after he frees them.\n \nAs the heroes escape on Gutt's new ship, the hyraxes fashion small ice boats, which they use to sail away to a new home in South America, taunting the pirates as they leave.\n \nThe hyraxes are last seen in South America, where they have made a new home and have even carved a hyrax-sized replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], welcoming the other animals.\n\n===Pirate rats===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = '''Pirates'''\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Rat]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Varying\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Dark gray\n}}\nA number of ''' pirate rats''' (or '''pie-rats''') made their homes on the \"ship\" of Captain Gutt, actually a giant iceberg carved into a seaworthy vessel with Gutt at its helm and a number of other animals as its crew. The rats subsided more or less well off with Gutt on board, though one of them suffered Gutt's annoyance when it was caught mocking his apish movements and thus picked up by the ape and flung off the ship.\n \nLater, once a number of seaborne mammals accidentally broke down Gutt's vessel, the rats abandoned ship, escaping into the waters below, with at least one pushed out forcefully by Scrat, another mammal taken hostage by Gutt.\n\n===Giant crab===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Giant crab\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Crab]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Greyish-Blue\n| lbl3               = Shell colour\n| data3              = Blue, red, and faded purple\n}}\nThe '''giant [[crab]]''' is a minor character in the fourth film. The giant crab was seen aboard Manny, Diego and Sid's \"ship\" during a storm. After trying to escape, Sid was trapped on the edge of the floating land. The crab tried to attack him, but it noticed a giant wave heading towards them; Sid, noticing it too, clutched onto the crab's leg in a terrified trance. As soon as the wave was gone, Sid tried to thank the giant crab for saving his life, but was horrified to see only its leg remaining, with leg then being blown away by the wind.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: Collision Course''==\n\n===Dino-Bird Family===\nThe '''Dino-Bird Family''' is a family of ''Bird-like [[Dromaeosauridae|Dromaeosaurid]]'' ''[[Dinosaurs]]'' that first appear in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''.

His personality is shown to be aloof, grumpy, and standoffish, but is otherwise loving and courageous. In the first film, while passing through the icy cave, the herd discovers [[cave painting]]s of Manny with his wife and child, who were killed by [[human]]s; this is a very sentimental moment for Manny, since he failed to protect them. Manny finds love with Ellie in ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''. In ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', he is anxious when Ellie is pregnant. At the end of the film, he becomes the proud father of a baby daughter named Peaches. In ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', he gets into an argument with his teenage daughter before being pulled away in by the drift with Diego, Sid and Granny. He and the team later encounter a group of pirates led by Captain Gutt. When the team escaped they destroy the ship and take Shira with them. This enrages the Captain who hunts them down. Later on, he is almost manipulated by [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]].\n\nA running gag for Manny, shown in four of the five films, is that if a certain character were to refer to him as fat, he would often deny it, saying that \"his fur is what makes him look big\" and that \"it's poofy\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sid===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sidney\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[John Leguizamo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Teal\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light yellow\n| alias              = Sid the Sloth\n| species            = [[Megalonyx]]\n| family             = Milton (father)<br>Eunice (mother)<br>Marshall (brother)<br>Fungus (uncle)<br>Granny (grandmother)\n}}\n'''Sidney \"Sid\"''' is a [[Ground Sloth]] in all five films who is dull-witted, talkative, friendly, carefree, [[Naivety|naive]], accident-prone, patient and funny with a caring nature, and is voiced with a [[lateral lisp]]. Little is known from Sid's life other than that Sid once lived in a tree with other sloths that always wanted to leave Sid behind when the migration occurred, using several different ways to leave him behind. What is clear is that Sid's mother always told him that \"bad news is just good news in disguise\" prior to abandoning him for good. He accidentally starts a fire in the first film and learns how to do it properly towards the end; he also shows this skill in the second film, where he is worshiped by a tribe of \"mini-sloths\" who call him \"Fire King\" and try to sacrifice him. In the third film, he adopts a trio of baby T-Rexes, and is forcibly taken to the underground dinosaur land by their mother, requiring the others to come and save him. In the fourth film, it is revealed that his full name is Sidney, though this name was also used in a deleted scene of the first film. When he, Diego and Manny are on the ice and are forced up by a [[Waterspout|water spout]], they see a [[rainbow]] in the bright blue sky as he told them that \"there is a rainbow at the end of every corner.\"\n\nA mechanical version of Sid appears in ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' during the miming scene.\n\nSid was built along the form typical of ground sloths, short, brushy tail, clawed hands and feet, a long thin neck, ovular head with bulbous eye on both sides and a pair of buckteeth. Sid's right front tooth was slightly bigger than the left, similar to his right eye, which was also somewhat bigger than the left, both eyes of which were pale green. Sid's pelt was dirty and tan, and became brown when the fungus it carried dried out, Sid attributing the state of his pelt to his vegetarian diet, which he said led to a younger-looking pelt. In his films, Sid faints at certain times when he's getting hit - e.g. he faints when he gets hit on the nose by a block of ice and apparently get his tongue stuck to the floor of an ice cave.\n\nIn the behind the scenes, the creators combined the traits of [[three-toed sloth]]s and [[ground sloth]]s while designing Sid and the other sloth characters.\n\n===Diego===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Diego\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002)\n| voice              = [[Denis Leary]] (films)<br>[[Rick Pasqualone]] (''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (video game)]]'')\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel/green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Orange\n| species            = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n}}\n'''Diego''' is a saber-toothed cat found in all five of the films. He is Shira's love interest. He has a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] personality, although it is not intended to be nasty. He was sent by his pack to retrieve the human baby called Roshan; When he found Roshan in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, when Manny saved his life, Diego had a change of heart, confessing about the pack and sacrifices himself to help them escape. He was seemingly killed by the pack's leader, Soto, but survived and joined Manny and Sid on their travels. In the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown|second film]], he was revealed to suffer from [[aquaphobia]], but he eventually conquered it in order to save Sid, Crash and Eddie. In the third film, he began to fear that he was losing his predatory abilities from being in the \"herd\" too long, and considered staying in the underground dinosaur world with Buck. He changed his mind after managing to save the labored Ellie from a dinosaur attack. In [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]], another ''[[Smilodon]]'' named Shira joins the group, and Diego feels attracted to her. During the end credits, Diego and Shira are seen nuzzling each other showing that they have now become a couple.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ellie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Ellie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = [[Queen Latifah]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light brown\n| spouse             = Manny\n| children           = Peaches (daughter)\n}} \n'''Ellie''' is a female woolly mammoth, whom Manny, Diego, and Sid meet during their migration to escape the flood in the second movie, ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''.\n\nIt was revealed that when Ellie was young, she was separated from her herd during the [[ice age]]. She came across two [[opossums]] named Crash and Eddie, along with their mother. She later forgot her origins and thought that she was an opossum.\n\nInitially Manny was overjoyed that he had found another of his kind, but got somewhat dismayed when he realized that Ellie believed that she was an opossum. Nevertheless, Sid welcomed Ellie and her brothers to travel with them, much to Manny's annoyance. During this time, Ellie displayed the mannerisms pertaining to an opossum as well as insisting (despite obvious proof that she was not a possum) and this tested Manny's patience, namely when she claimed that the act of bravery that he had done of fighting off the sea reptile Cretaceous was dumb.\n\nSoon, Manny got his time to be alone with Ellie when he and Ellie went for a walk through a wooded area, where Ellie had a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that told her of her past. Upon remembering this, she knew that she was a mammoth. When Manny later implied that they must mate in order to save the mammoths from extinction, she was initially angered, but in time she apologized for overreacting.\n\nSoon, however, this new \"herd\" reached a horrible obstacle between them and safety from the oncoming flood: a field of geysers, which Manny explained must be crossed, but Ellie would not listen: she and her brothers felt that they must go around. But this proved to be disastrous: as they were trying to reach their destination, some rocks caved down and nearly crushed Ellie and her brothers, but trapped them instead in a sort of cave. Manny rescued Ellie, for the water was flooding into the cave where she was trapped and had nearly drowned Ellie. She and Manny escaped and regrouped with the others, but faced another problem, for the waters were still rising.\n\nAfter the waters had subsided a herd of mammoths made their way into the valley. Manny thought that because the mammoths had come, that Ellie would not want to remain with him. He was persuaded otherwise by Sid and Diego and confronted Ellie confessing his feelings, saying that he wanted to be together not because they had to be, but because he himself wanted to. Ellie accepted him as her mate. The mammoths trumpet while Manny and Ellie embrace. Manny and Ellie decide to stay with their old friends, taking along Sid, Diego, and the possum brothers.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', she and Manny are mates and Ellie is pregnant with their first child. When they find the Dinosaur World under their feet, they have to go in and search for Sid in Lava Falls. When very close to Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labour, and gives birth to Peaches (which was named after the codeword that was for if Ellie went into labor on the trip). When they reunite with Sid and return to the surface, Ellie introduces Peaches to the herd's new home.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', she is an understanding wife and a mother. Ellie supports Peaches, when she had an argument with Manny. When the Ice Age: Continental Drift happens she aids the herd to the Land Bridge. In the end, she also fights with the Pirates.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Crash and Eddie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Crash and Eddie\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006)\n| voice              = Crash: [[Seann William Scott]] <br>Eddie: [[Josh Peck]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Virginia opossum]]s\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Crash: Blue <br> Eddie: Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark brown striped\n}}\n'''Crash''' and '''Eddie''' are two twin brother opossums. Adoptive brothers of Ellie, they cared for her and taught her to hang by her tail from a tree branch when she slept, as they did. They are shown to be adventurous and fun-loving, courtesy of the fact that they're both very stupid.\n\nThey first made their presence known to the opening characters by means of shooting pebbles through reeds at Sid and Diego, then roasting them so as to humiliate them, but Diego began chasing them, leading both Sid and Diego to Ellie. After Sid invites them to travel with them, Ellie and her brothers agreed, much to the annoyance of Manny.\n\nAs they traveled with Manny and his friends, Ellie grew closer to Manny, putting both Crash and Eddie somewhat closer to Manny and his friends, but creating a short feud when Manny tried \"hitting on\" Ellie. They even play dead when crows are nearby. In time, however, they saw behind the petty grudges and worked together with Manny, Sid, and Diego to escape the flood, but left with Ellie when she left Manny and his friends to cross the minefield, as she claimed that it was suicide to cross it. Crash and Eddie joined Ellie in trying to escape the flood, but soon ran into trouble when they were trapped in a cave.\n\nEllie insisted that they leave her to the point of pushing them outwards from a small crevice, but they promised to return with help, and true to their word, persuaded Manny to try and free Ellie. They eventually made their way into a rushing current of water and were almost swept away when an overzealous Sid came along to jump into the current, leaving them, in addition to holding onto a branch for dear life against the current of water, trying to hold onto an unconscious Sid. Diego eventually helped when he jumped in and saved them from drowning along with Sid. When Manny had saved Ellie from drowning, they helped Ellie back onto solid ground, but almost drowned when the flood was encroaching.\n\nEventually however, the waters drained, leaving Crash, Eddie, and all of the others alive. When a herd of mammoths came by (as mammoths were presumed all but extinct), they thought that Ellie would go with them and leave Manny, so they went with her. But as it turned out, Manny and Ellie stayed together because they wanted to, rather than being obligated to, and so they left onwards with Sid and Diego, as well as Crash and Eddie.\n\nIn the third film, Crash and Eddie travel with the others to the dino jungle to save Sid from Momma, and both grow to idolize Buck, the one-eyed dinosaur-hunting weasel who helped them find Sid. In the third film, they also mentioned they never liked Sid. This is not true however, due to helping Buck save Sid from his incoming death.\n\nOverall, they are very close and almost inseparable as brothers, as shown in the sequels. They are near-on identical: Crash has blue eyes and a flatter nose with ridges, and was voiced by [[Seann William Scott]] while Eddie has brown eyes and a pointier nose with a brown stripe, and was voiced by [[Josh Peck]]. Their mom is Mother Opossum, who first saved Ellie when Crash and Eddie were very small.\n \nIn ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'', Crash and Eddie, along with Buck, ride a pterosaur and save Sid from a lava flow heading downwards.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', they have more minor roles than in the previous films but do partake in the final battle with Gutt's crew fighting Dobson by hopping on his back and having a rodeo, but accidentally let him charge into Manny and, later Shira, knocking them onto the other ship.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Peaches===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Peaches\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (2009)\n| voice              = [[Ciara Bravo]] (''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'')<br>[[Keke Palmer]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Light green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Auburn\n| spouse             = Julian\n| family             = Manny (father)<br>Ellie (mother)\n| relatives          = Crash and Eddie (adoptive uncles)\n}}\n'''Peaches''' is the daughter of [[Manny (Ice Age)#Manny|Manny]] and [[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]], born in the Dinosaurs' world whilst they were under attack by a pack of Guanlong. She appeared close to end of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and was named after the code-word that was thought up to say that Ellie was going into labour. Manny also claims that [[peach]]es are sweet, round and fuzzy, just like Peaches and Ellie. She looks exactly like her mother, Ellie (which Sid thinks is very lucky). At the end of the film, she returned to the surface with her parents and the rest of the group. She is voiced by [[Ciara Bravo]] in ''[[Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas]]'' as a kid, and [[Keke Palmer]] in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as a teenager, and also as a young adult in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]''.\n\nPeaches appears as a teenager in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''. She is self-taught to do some possum moves just like her mother. Shortly after Scrat sets off a domino effect of the continents breaking apart, she is shown sneaking up in the morning going to the falls with Louis, a molehog who is also her best friend. After Manny embarrasses her in front of Ethan, her crush, and the other mammoths by grounding her, she and her father get into a fight, and as a result, when he, Diego, and Sid get separated from them on an iceberg, she feels not only helpless to stop it but also guilty. Later during the events of the film, it is Ethan who shows an interest in her hanging out with him and his friends. As a kind of condition, he suggests for her to leave Louis behind. Convinced he'd start to like her, she readily agrees. The following day, while walking with Ethan and the other mammoths, unbeknownst to them that Louis was looking for her, they begin to question her about her friendship with him. When she claims to have none so as to gain their approval, Louis overhears, also making himself known. Shortly after Louis leaves, Peaches begins to grow tired of the other mammoths' teasing, as immediately afterwards a tremor causes a dangerous moving cloud of dust, and instead of expressing concern they try to convince her that it was fun escaping the blast. Upon calling them out on their stupid behaviour, Ethan and the others carelessly judge her by her family being part possum, causing her to get upset, confront Ethan, then leave. At the end of the movie, she and her herd are, in part, saved by Louis, who bravely challenges Captain Gutt, and distracts him from Peaches by slamming a chunk of ice on his foot. His bravery, as well as Peaches' own heroics in saving her mother, impress Ethan and his friends, who ask to hang out with them instead. Louis casually agrees.\n\nIn ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', Peaches is now a young adult and prepares to marry a male mammoth named Julian.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Granny===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Granny\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Wanda Sykes]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = Faded purple with scraggly grey scalp hair\n| family             = Milton (son)<br>Fungus (son)<br>Eunice (daughter-in-law)<br>Sid (grandson)<br>Marshall (grandson)\n}}\n'''Granny''' is a Megalonyx and also [[Sid (Ice Age)#Sid|Sid]]'s grandmother. She joins the herd after her own family abandons her, calling her \"dead weight\" to save their own skins before the earthquake (that and to avoid Sid). Despite, how Granny sometimes picks on and berates her grandson, Sid is very happy to have her around. Granny is loud, abrasive, tough, sarcastic, somewhat crazy, as she once thought Gutt was actually being nice to her. Over time she begins to warm up to the group, as Sid asked Granny why their own family abandoned him and Granny; for a moment, Granny sympathetically answers \"because they think we're screw-ups and can't do anything right\". She even helps out in several attempts to get back home. At the end Granny admits that Sid is lucky to have a real family (his herd) that care so much about him. She quickly asks Sid to chew her food, but Sid had fixed her a new set of teeth, a pair of shark teeth that were originally Raz's weapon but Granny uses them quite well as they are very sharp.\n\nIt is shown in the film she had an allegedly imaginary pet named Precious, which showed up at the end and turned out to be real: a giant whale who defeats Gutt's crew (minus Squint) by blasting them away. Precious then helped the group to Switchback Cove and Granny bids her pet a fond good-bye.\n\n===Louis===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Louis\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Josh Gad]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Molehog\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Fur color\n| data3              = White, grey brown, and brown\n}}\nPeaches' best friend '''Louis''', is a timid, well-spoken, and cute molehog (a small mammal that lives during the [[ice age]]s. The molehog's name is a portmanteau of [[Mole (animal)|mole]] and [[hedgehog]]), who is always dutifully by her side and eager to help, even if it is to help her get closer to pretty boy Ethan. When Peaches' heart is ultimately broken by Ethan, Louis secretly wishes that she could see that he is the only one who adores her just as she is. Peaches is very oblivious to his crush on her. He tries to be the voice of reason when she is up to some things, because of his soft-spoken demeanor and his somewhat cowardice, Manny alongside Crash and Eddie, have dubbed him \"Wiener\". Even after having his feelings hurt by Peaches, Louis comes to his friends side when she is held hostage by Gutt. He fends off Gutt long enough for Peaches to escape, impressed by his bravery, Manny even encourages Louis to be more open minded to adventures like Peaches. Ethan and his posse even ask to hang out with him, as they seem to move on in life as friends. The only flaw with Louis' life in Ice Age is, along with \"The Brat Pack\", he seems to lack parents and other family members that he would live with.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Shira===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Shira\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' (2012)\n| voice              = [[Jennifer Lopez]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Blue\n| lbl3               = Fur Color\n| data3              = White with black stripes\n| lbl4               = Accessories\n| data4              = 2 earrings in each ear, one blue and one green.\n}}\n'''Shira''' appears in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as part of Gutt's crew, and is Captain Gutt's pawn. She is a dazzlingly beautiful, female saber-toothed cat and Diego's lover resembling a [[snow leopard]]. She makes her first appearance in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift#Marketing|Scrat's Continental Crack-up: Part 2]]'' standing next to Captain Gutt, who is holding Scrat.\n\nShira first appears when Gutt's crew attacks the herds \"ship\". Diego is smitten upon his first sight on her as she is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen. Diego, wanting himself, Manny, Sid, and Granny to get back home, tries to chomp off all the pirates' ropes from their \"ship\", but is too late as Shira arrives and restrains him, mocking him for his declaration of \"I don't fight girls\" by pinning him down and saying, \"I can see why\". After Manny and the others escape by capsizing Gutt's iceberg, Shira is seen in the water, calling out for her crewmates' help; only Flynn is concerned over Shira's whereabouts, but Gutt ignores this and demands his crew to move on forward without her. She is rescued against her will by Manny, and is angered when Diego calls her \"Kitty\" for calling them a \"bad joke\" of a herd. She journeyed with the herd to an island. Once there, she attempts to escape, but Diego catches up to her and she is imprisoned in a tree, much to her anger.\n\nThat night, Shira is approached by Diego, who learns she left her pack as he once did. Diego tells her that she simply traded one pack for another, and that his herd always has each other's backs, pointing out that Gutt hadn't made any thoughts of planning a search party for her in the first place. The next morning, Shira escapes and finds Gutt making a new ship on the other side of the island. Gutt angrily berates her for not killing the herd, and punishes her by making Squint his new first mate while she gets demoted. Gutt then orders Shira to target Diego, declaring that he would have a tiger-skin rug when it ended, he didn't care whose (somewhat proving Diego's point to Shira that Gutt never had his back on her or anyone else). When the herd enacts their plans to take Gutt's new ship back home, Shira once again tackles Diego, who convinces her to turn against Gutt and come with him. Because of their newfound love, she follows Diego to the ship, but on seeing that Gutt is catching up to them, secretly puts ice in his way. As the herd floats away, Shira tells Diego that she has his back, while both looking at each other longingly as the boat leaves implying they have feelings for each other.\n\nDuring the return home, Diego realized he had fallen in love with Shira, despite denying it to Manny and Sid. Later, when Gutt is holding Peaches hostage, Shira is seen struggling to get up, implying that Gutt had physically punished Shira for her betrayal. During the fight, she protects Ellie from Squint, mocking the rabbit's \"cute little bunny nose\". After the defeat of Gutt's crew, Shira joins the herd, sharing a loving look with Diego. She also rests her head on Diego's shoulder during the herd's landing on switchback cove. In the end credits, Shira nuzzles against Diego's side showing that they have now become a couple.\n\n===Julian===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Julian\n| first              = ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' (2016)\n| voice              = [[Adam DeVine]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| species            = [[Woolly mammoth]]\n}}\n'''Julian''' is a young and courageous mammoth who is Peaches' fianc\u00e9 and part-time member of The Herd and The Brat Pack.

He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the main characters, though the two do intersect at times.\n\nIn a special feature in the second film's DVD, his name has been stated to be a mix of the words \"[[squirrel]]\" and \"[[rat]]\", his species allegedly believed to have been a common ancestor of both. In the ''Ice Age'' [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he is referred to as \"The Scrat\" by directors [[Chris Wedge]] and [[Carlos Saldanha]].\n\nScrat is voiced in all ''Ice Age'' movies and short films by director Chris Wedge. He directly interacts with the story's main characters on eight occasions, mostly with Sid. In the first film, he attacks Sid when the latter tries to eat his acorn, successfully regaining it. He later meets Manny, Sid, and Diego asking him where the baby's family is and Scrat attempts to tell them about nearby saber-toothed tigers, but Diego kicks Scrat away before he could do so. At the end of the second film, after Scrat created a hole in the valley and released all the melted ice, later attacks Sid for saving his life (when he had already almost died and gone to paradise and was about to get a giant acorn). In the third film, Scrat is stepped on by Manny and falls onto Sid's head while chasing his acorn. Next, he appears when Sid's \"children\" are batting a ball around, the ball actually being Scrat. Also, when Scratte rips off his fur, he screams so loud the herd can hear him, causing Crash and Eddie to deem the place a \"Jungle of Misery\". Lastly, while Diego is sleeping, he wakes up when he gets hit with Scrat's acorn. In the fourth film, when Sid pries open a clam, he finds Scrat inside. Sid's grandmother mistakes Scrat for a rat and continuously hits him with her cane until he falls into the ocean.\n\nScrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or painful situations: being struck by lightning, pursued by avalanches, and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully \"battles\" Sid.\n\nScrat is the main character in four short films. In the first, ''[[Gone Nutty]]'', he loses his collection of [[acorn]]s in a catastrophic chain of events. He jams his acorn into a hole in the middle of the collection, which shatters the pile and with it the entire continent - which begins the [[continental drift]].\n\nIn the second film, ''[[No Time for Nuts]]'', Scrat finds a [[time travel|time machine]] left by a time-traveler and visits several historical events. He becomes trapped in a frightening future when oak trees have become extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period.\n\nA third Scrat short, ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'', was released in 2010 accompanying the feature ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'', and later with ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' as a promotion for the fourth Ice Age movie ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].''<ref>{{cite news |title=Swift injustice |first=James |last=Verniere |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330&position=also |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2010-12-25 |accessdate=2 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226092036/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330 |archive-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA fourth and most recent short film, ''[[Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe]]'', was released in 2015 preceding ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''.\n\nScrat has a cameo in ''[[Surviving Sid]]'', that is important to the plot.\n\nScrat is the main character in the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown#Video game|''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' video game]].

Cartoon designer [[Ivy Supersonic]] claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in [[Skidmore College]]'s Case Green. She called her character \"Sqrat\" and says she presented the idea to 20th Century Fox movie executives. A CNN report by Jeanne Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development.

While sleeping one morning, his tribe is attacked by a pack of smilodons. The leader of the pack, Soto, wants to kill the baby as revenge for the baby's father killing half the pack and using their skin as clothes and their flesh as food. His mother is able to fend off Diego, whose mission is to retrieve him. However, she is cornered over a waterfall. In a desperate attempt to save her son, leaps over the waterfall, holding the baby tightly in her arms. They are both found by Manny and Sid at the riverside. Using what little strength she has left, she gives the baby to Manny and Sid in hopes that he will be safe with them.\n\nRoshan's primary care-provider is Sid, the only member of the group who initially has concern for him, Manny being too disillusioned to care and Diego secretly planning to kill him. Manny, scarred by his previous experience with humans, is reluctant to have anything to do with the baby, but eventually bonds with him. At the end of the movie, the baby is reunited with his tribe.\n\n===Soto's Pack===\n'''Soto's Pack''' is a group of [[saber-toothed cat]]s that are the primary antagonists of ''Ice Age''. They targeted Roshan as revenge on his tribe of Neanderthals because half of their pack was killed by them. Diego was formerly of this group before he defected to Manny and Sid's side.\n\n====Soto====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Soto\n| voice              = [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Green\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Dark orange\n}}\n'''Soto''' is the violent and sadistic Smilodon who is the leader of a pack of saber-toothed cats. He wants to eat Roshan in vengeance for the murders of several of his pack-mates. He is the main antagonist of the first film.\n\nAs part of his plan to kidnap Roshan, Soto plans an attack on the human camp so that while he and three other pack members would attack the humans, Diego would sneak in, unnoticed, and abduct Roshan. Diego fails at this task, leaving Soto furious, telling Diego to bring Roshan to Half-Peak where he would meet with the others and threatens have him served as a replacement if he fails. Soto dispatched his fellow pack members Zeke and Oscar to warn Diego to hurry and bring Roshan or not return at all, though was reciprocated with the news that alongside Roshan, Soto would receive a mammoth.\n\nSoto eventually made it with his pack to Half Peak and informed Diego that while he had his doubts, he was pleased that Diego had made it. Soon it would happen that unbeknownst to Soto, Diego was in league with both Manny and Sid, and so Sid would lure Soto and his pack-mates away from both Manny and Roshan with a decoy made of snow.\n\nSoto fought viciously in the altercation in which he made an attempt to kill Manny, but was stopped by the now-reformed Diego, whom he severely maimed. Out of anger, Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice, knocking loose a row of icicles, the sharp ice formations falling, and end up killing Soto offscreen.\n\n====Zeke====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Zeke\n| voice              = [[Jack Black]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Grayish-brown\n}}\n'''Zeke''' is an overactive Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nHe is led by Soto who is out to seek Roshan and kill him. Zeke is dark-gray and looked rough, as well as acting the part of a suck up. It is revealed in a deleted scene that he, like the other members of his pack, wanted very much to follow the \"walking buffet\" south, but Soto would not hear of it. Zeke accompanied Oscar to tell Diego to hurry up and bring back Roshan or not to come back. Diego had him inform Soto that there will be a mammoth traveling with the baby as well. He soon made it along with the rest of his pack to Half Peak, where he tried to kill Sid and Roshan, but was outwitted by Sid who stomped him into a tiny crevice with his hindquarters sticking out. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards.\n\n====Oscar====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Oscar\n| voice              = [[Diedrich Bader]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Smilodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light Brown\n}}\n'''Oscar''' is a tall Smilodon and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nOscar is shown to doubting Diego's abilities because he messed up once in bringing Roshan to Soto. In a deleted scene, he is seen telling his packmates of his disapproval of Soto's plans to stay and hunt the humans instead of following the migrating herds traveling south. Oscar went along with Zeke to find Diego and warn him to hurry and bring Roshan. Oscar made it with the rest of the pack to Half Peak where he attempted to kill Manny but was defeated along with the others. He is last seen running away after he and Lenny see Soto killed by Manny, leaving him and Lenny's fates unknown.\n\n====Lenny====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Lenny\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Homotherium]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Hazel\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Light Brown\n}}\n'''Lenny''' is a rotund Homotherium and a member of Soto's pack.\n\nLenny, along with the rest of the pack, attacked the human encampment but were fended off by the humans' dogs who fought alongside the humans against the pack sending them off. One of the pack members Diego was expected to steal the baby Roshan from the humans but missed his chance when Roshan's mother Nadia escaped with her child through a waterfall. Bitter at Diego's failure the pack leader Soto orders Diego to retrieve Roshan and bring him to Half Peak where the others will be waiting. Soto was later informed by other pack members Zeke and Oscar that Diego will bring Roshan back along with a wooly Mammoth called Manny who has been caring for Roshan along with Sid the sloth.\n\nLenny met up with Diego along with the other members of the pack at Half Peak where Zeke reminisced the joys of mammoth flesh much to Lenny's displeasure (saying his only lines in the film, \"Hey, knock it off. I'm starving!\" and \"I told you to knock it off!\"). He then demanded Zeke to stop talking about food and then tries to strike him but is stopped by Soto who tells him to save energy as mammoths don't go down easily. Soto plans an ambush on Manny so he would be caught by surprise and so he ordered the pack not to attack until they saw Manny but Diego secretly turned on his pack after he had been shown real friendship and appreciation from Manny and Sid so he tempted Zeke to leap into action and attack. The surprise given away, the pack pursue Sid as he slides down a snowy slope on a piece of bark soon after Lenny and Oscar who had been chasing Sid where hit by a large log Manny threw at them. Once they recovered they saw that Soto had been killed when he tried to attack Manny and that Diego had thwarted Soto's attacks. Manny throws Soto into a wall of ice and a number of icicles fall down and kill him. Seeing the death of their leader, Lenny and Oscar run off. It is unknown what happened to them afterwards.\n\nUnlike the rest of his pack who are all [[saber-toothed cat]]s, Lenny is a [[Homotherium|scimitar-toothed cat]] as stated in the book ''Ice Age: The Essential Guide''.\n\n===Runar===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Runar\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Nadia (deceased)\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Runar''' was the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of the Neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nRunar was a leader for a tribe of Neanderthals (referred in the film as humans). He was the father of Roshan and husband of Nadia, and cared greatly for his family, all the while leading them and the rest of the tribe as a nomadic group to travel from place to place. In one encampment that his tribe set up, half a pack of saber-toothed tigers was killed and the furs taken as coats and clothing. In vengeance, the leader saber-tooth named Soto decided to plan an attack on Runar's tribe so as to take his son Roshan and kill him in vengeance for those saber-teeth slain in battle by Runar's tribe. The attack almost worked, but Runar's tribe had trained [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]] that detected Soto's pack coming and alerted the human tribe to battle the saber-teeth, with Soto fighting directly with Runar while the rest of the tribe fought the other saber-tooth tigers and unleash their wolves to help. In the melee, the baby Roshan was taken by his mother from a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and the hunters successfully warded off the saber-teeth. Runar tried to help his wife and son, but is stopped by Soto and Oscar. After the fight, he finds out that his son and wife had disappeared.\n\nRunar had no choice left but to begin the travel to another camp far off, tracking the dangerous saber-teeth on the way and finding clues as to his son's whereabouts. In time, Runar made it near the settlement and was finally re-united with his son, but not before meeting face-to-face with Manny and Sid, the two animals who returned the child. Runar was on his guard about Manny at first, as he appeared violent while his tribe quickly rush in to attack Manny and Sid. Upon seeing Roshen, he quickly came to see that they meant no harm, simply to return his child and stopped his tribe from attacking them.\n\nRunar thanked Manny by giving him the charm bracelet that had once been Roshan's, and after letting his son say goodbye to Manny and Sid, Runar left the scene with his tribe and his son in tow.\n\n===Nadia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Nadia\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Neanderthal]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Hair\n| data3              = Dark brown\n| spouse             = Runar\n| children           = Roshan (son)\n}}\n'''Nadia''' was the wife of the chieftain of a neanderthal tribe shown in the first film.\n\nNadia had a husband, Runar, and a baby son, Roshan. She and her family lived a peaceful life together with their tribe until the day when a pack of saber-toothed tigers invaded their camp to abduct the youngest member, Roshan in revenge for the tribe killing half of their pack. Nadia fended off an attack on Roshan long enough to run away quickly from Diego who was pursuing her. Nadia ran with Roshan in her arms until she reached a high waterfall and was cornered. She jumped, holding on tightly to her son all the while; she then ended up on the riverbank below, meeting Manny and Sid, two animals that were passing by. With the last of her strength, Nadia nudged Roshan to these animals in the hopes that they could be entrusted with her son. Seconds after this act, she slipped slowly from the riverbank, disappearing. Her fate remains unknown, although it is heavily implied that she may have drowned.\n\n===The Dodo Birds===\nThese '''[[Dodo]]s''' are portrayed as greedy for [[watermelon]]s claiming it to be their private stockpile for the ice age. All these dodos hate to be extinct. Some appear to be military marching. Trying to get a watermelon from Sid, Diego and Manny who try to ask for it for the baby's hunger, some of these dodos accidentally fall to where they tossed the melon. Four of these fall into the pit to [[death by burning|burn to death]] as one warns a few, where another melon is also incinerated. The rest are defeated by Sid who protects the last melon from them by getting through them.\n\n====Dab====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dab\n| voice              = [[Alan Tudyk]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Dodo]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Feathers\n| data3              = Powder blue\n}}\n'''Dab''' was the head [[dodo]] shown in the first film.\n\nThe dodos were collecting a stockpile for the winter, and one of them stole the melon that Manny had spotted for Roshan. When Manny, Sid and Diego went to the dodos to get the melon back, they found the dodos on parade. The dodos' stockpile so far consisted only of three melons, including the stolen melon. After Manny pointed this out, the dodos fought to stop Manny, Diego and Sid getting at the melons. In the fight, the first melon fell over a cliff and several dodos, including the flock's \"last female\", jumped over as well in a [[suicide|suicid]]al attempt to retrieve it. The second melon bounced into a boiling [[tar pit]], along with three more unfortunate dodos who were trying to stop it falling in. Sid managed to get the last melon, and the remaining dodos also fell off the cliff, a parody as to why they are extinct today. In ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'', another dodo gets fried while attempting to cross the geyser fields and in the epilogue of the sequel, there is a dodo choir singing angelically as Scrat enters heaven. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Carl and Frank===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Carl and Frank\n| voice              = Carl: [[Cedric the Entertainer]]<br>Frank: [[Stephen Root]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = Carl: ''[[Embolotherium]]''<br>Frank: ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Black\n| lbl3               = Skin\n| data3              = Gray\n}}\n'''Carl''' and '''Frank''' are an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' and a ''[[Megacerops|Brontops]]'' respectively. Carl had thick lips and a thick horn, while Frank had more pointed lips and a thinner horn. They referred to Sid as an overgrown weasel.\n\nThe two appeared at the beginning of the film when Sid the [[ground sloth]] was shown stepping on their salad and eating an important part of it, the [[dandelion]]. The two animals soon chased after him in the hopes of killing him, but were stopped forcefully by Manny the mammoth, by being hurled through the air. They'd held a powerful grudge against Sid for what he'd done and when they next saw him, he was in the same hot mud pool that they were in and was erroneously referring to them as ladies. Again, Carl and Frank stampeded after the hapless sloth, but were waylaid when they saw that he had already been \"killed\" by a saber-toothed cat named Diego (which was part of Sid's plan to get them to be fooled into leaving him alone and not trying to kill him off) and gave up their chase post-haste stating that \"carnivores have all the fun.\" Carl and Frank aren't seen again after this.\n\n===Jennifer and Rachel===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jennifer and Rachel\n| voice              = Jennifer: [[Lorri Bagley]]<br>Rachel: [[Jane Krakowski]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Jennifer: [[Blue]]<br>Rachel: [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = Jennifer: [[Violet (color)|Violet]] with [[black]] hair<br>Rachel: [[Pink]] with [[blond]] hair\n}}\n'''Jennifer''' and '''Rachel''' are two ''Megalonyx'' from the first film.\n\nThe two were shown being sweet-talked by Sid to impress them while he had the baby Roshan in tow. Jennifer admitted that she found some of Sid's qualities to be most attractive, and when Sid left, the two spoke to each other on how, despite his lack of good looks, he was a family-type.\n\nThese two female sloths (in a deleted scene from the film) were shown scorning Sid when he was shown to simply be using the baby to mate with them, though Rachel was much more straightforward as she kicked him directly in the groin while calling him \"''pig''\".\n\nJennifer was a thickset dark-blue sloth with short curly hair and a medium-sized nose. Rachel was considerably thinner and had light tan fur and a blonde ponytail directly at the top of her head and a smaller nose.\n\n===Sylvia===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sylvia\n| voice              = [[Kristen Johnston]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = [[Megalonyx]]\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = [[Green]]\n| lbl3               = Fur\n| data3              = [[Red]] with red hair\n}}\n'''Sylvia''' is a female Megalonyx who was cut from the first film, but can be found in the deleted scenes of the 2-Disc DVD release as well as the film-to-book adaptation.\n\nSylvia wanted Sid to travel with her, for she was seeking commitment. Sid, not wanting any of this, put her in the path of some running glyptodonts to send her off. Sylvia eventually found him again, and was still adamant to go migrating with him. Sid tricked her into thinking that he was getting turnips for their migration, and then ran off to escape, but she followed him into the jaws of Diego, the saber-toothed cat. She did not believe that Sid was truly dead, and sullenly told Diego to \"eat him\". It is presumed that after that, she left Sid alone. Sylvia had red-colored fur, green eyes and a small nose.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentaries, Sylvia was cut because the scriptwriters felt that Sid's behavior towards her made him too unlikable, and that her scenes detracted from the film's main plot. Additionally, the first movie had a different ending planned out. Sid and Manny headed south without Diego (due to his death, which was changed) and met up with the other animals. Sid had matured after witnessing Diego's death, and upon seeing Sylvia for the third time, was nicer to her, even asking her to be his mate.\n\nSylvia was cut from the movie fairly late. Most of her scenes were completely animated and rendered, and she was seen in the first few trailers of the movie as well as the initial posters.\n\n==Appearing in ''Ice Age: The Meltdown''==\n\n===Fast Tony===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Fast Tony\n| voice              = [[Jay Leno]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Holmesina]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Brown\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| data3              = Blue-gray\n| lbl4               = Skin\n| data4              = Peach\n}}\nA [[Holmesina]] living in the days of the Ice Age, '''Fast Tony''' was a [[peddler]] trying to give off items such as reeds and bark to other denizens of the Ice Age so as to escape the world's end, which by chance, he predicted and it came true. Fast Tony would give off products in exchange for whatever the other animals would bring by with the help of his \"''assistant''\", an insipid [[glyptodon]] named Stu. He was notoriously amoral with others, even being criticized by Manny for willing to sell off ''\"his own mother for a [[grape]]\"''. Fast Tony immediately asked if that was an offer, then pretended he had not thought of it for the benefit of the watching animals.\n\nStu was more Fast Tony's guinea pig to prove their wares' worth, rather than his actual partner and proved more useful dead than alive, as Fast Tony had taken Stu's shell (as Stu had just been killed by Maelstrom and Cretaceous) and shamelessly tried to pawn it off to other animals as a personal \"''mobile home''\".\n\nFast Tony was last seen at the end of ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' using Stu's shell as a raft.\n\n====Stu====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Stu\n| voice              = [[Tom Fahn]]\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Glyptodon]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| lbl3               = Shell\n| lbl4               = Skin\n}}\n'''Stu''' was a ''Glyptodon'' who was Fast Tony's partner. He seemed to be disliked by Tony due to his stupid personality. He assisted Fast Tony to warn the valley that the dam of ice would burst and helped to demonstrate Fast Tony's snorkel. After the revelation of the flood was proved to be true, Stu took the test snorkel and used it to swim underwater. Shortly after scaring James, a young anteater, Stu was grabbed and pulled underwater by an unknown attacker. As the other animals begin to leave, Fast Tony returns to the pool to get Stu to come along, but Stu's shell is suddenly spat out of the water by the unknown assailant. Fast Tony, after looking at the shell, sees that it makes a great mobile home and runs off after the other animals to try and unload it on someone.

Buck is the only inhabitant of the dinosaurs' world who does not fear Rudy in the slightest, though he possesses a deep respect for him. Due to living underground for so long, he has an extensive knowledge of the dangers of the dinosaur world.\n\nBuck first meets Manny, Crash, Eddie, Diego, and Ellie (who he at one point refers to as \"preggers\") after they descend into the jungle in pursuit of Sid and Momma, and saves them from a dinosaur attack. He has been living in the jungle for quite some time, persistently hunting Rudy to avenge the loss of his eye, and agrees to lead them to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid, and rescues him after taking control of a ''[[Harpactognathus]]''.\n\nAfter Rudy's potential death, Buck, having lost his purpose in life, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. Upon hearing a distant familiar roar that tells him that Rudy survived the fall, he chooses to stay and causes a cave-in that seals off the path between the surface and the underground jungle, trapping him inside and everyone else on the surface. He and Rudy proceed to continue their battle.\n\nBuck and Rudy make brief cameos in ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'' and ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' when Scrat falls through the Earth and passes them.\n\nHe returns to help the herd with an ancient stone pillar and rejoins them to stop the asteroid in ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' while being pursued by a family of Dino-Birds.\n\nDue to his voice actor, Buck speaks with a British accent.\n\n===Momma===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Momma\n| voice              = N/A\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Scales\n| data3              = Red-violet with an orange face and yellow belly\n}}\n'''Momma''' was a female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.

When Buck first arrived in the jungle, he was attacked by Rudy, who scratched him in the right eye, thus poking it out, and very nearly devoured him. Buck escaped, knocking out one of Rudy's teeth in the process. Rudy appears to have held a grudge ever since, especially since the impact left behind a crack in his mouth which prevented any new teeth from growing. (Note: Rudy is constantly mistaken for a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and although he has features of both species, the filmmakers have directly stated he is a ''Baryonyx''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}) Rudy first appears when he attacks Sid and chases him onto a rock floating over Lava Falls, and later attacks Sid and company full force as they are about to exit the jungle. The group quickly proves to be no match for the ''Baryonyx'', but are saved by Momma, who knocks him off of a cliff. Rudy survives, however, and he and Buck continue their eternal war.

His friendly demeanor quickly vanishes when Manny refuses; he throws the mammoth and his friends overboard, and furiously vows revenge when they destroy his ship and bounty during their escape.\n\nGutt enslaves a population of hyraxes to build a new ship for him, and also strips Shira of her rank as first mate when she reveals she did not attack Manny, giving her position to Squint. Gutt leads his crew to battle against the unenslaved hyraxes, only for the hyraxes to be revealed as a distraction while Manny steals his new ship. Enraged, Gutt quickly forges a new ship out of a wall of ice, propelled by his legion of [[narwhal]]s. Gutt arrives at Manny's home, and takes Ellie, Peaches, and the other animals hostage.\n\nManny turns himself in to free his wife and daughter, but Gutt goes back on his word, stating that Manny took everything he had from him and the evil captain intended to do the same. However, the timely arrival of Louis, Peaches' friend, sparks a fierce battle between the pirates and Manny's herd. Gutt tries to fight Manny along with Raz, but Diego fights Gutt himself.

Gutt corners the herd, but he and his pirates are defeated by Granny's pet whale Precious.\n\nGutt is swift enough to dodge Precious' blasts while Squint, Raz, Flynn, Dobson, Silas, and Gupta are knocked onto the side of their ship and into the sea; Gutt escapes and leaves his crew behind.

A new landmass emerges and launches the iceberg that the two are standing on into the air.\n\nGutt battles Manny with his two swords, stating that \"the sea isn't big enough\" for the two of them. Manny charges into Gutt, knocking him down, but Gutt is able to push the mammoth off of him. Manny charges again, but Gutt swings on a number of vines to catch up to the floe; Manny follows. Gutt pushes Manny onto the front of the floe and grabs a log to finish him off, but Manny jumps onto the back of the floe, which launches Gutt off the floe.

When the pirates first encounter Manny's herd, Flynn inadvertently gives them directions to return to the continent, much to Gutt's exasperation. The seal then joined the attack on the herd, squashing Sid underneath his bulk. When Manny's herd destroys the ship, leaving the pirates to drift at sea, Flynn initially panics at the prospect of [[drowning]], but is reminded by an annoyed Gutt that he is able to swim. Flynn worries about Shira when Gutt leaves her for dead, but he later propels the pirates to land aboard a small raft made of ice.\n\nIn the final battle, Flynn and Gupta corner Sid and Granny, only for the latter to summon Precious, sending the pirates running in fear.

Squint holds a rivalry with Shira, which reaches its climax when Squint becomes Gutt's new first mate after Gutt insults Shira for failing to kill Manny and his herd.\n\nIn the final battle, Squint attempts to attack Shira as she is trying to free Ellie, but Shira mocks Squint's 'adorable nose', which agitates him and allows Ellie to stomp on him.\n\nSquint later resurfaces in ''[[Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade]]'' where Squint wanted revenge on the Herd.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Dobson====\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Dobson\n| lbl1               = Species\n| data1              = ''[[Metridiochoerus]]''\n| lbl2               = Eyes\n| data2              = Gold\n| lbl3               = Fur colour\n| data3              = Red/Violet & Brownish Gray\n}}\n'''Dobson''' is a ''[[Metridiochoerus]]'', who speaks in growls, oinks, and other pig noises (although he appeared to be singing along with the crew in the \"Master of the Seas\" musical sequence).

Later, Granny and Sid use her like a submarine to fight with the pirates.\n\nLarge, even for a whale, Precious was the beloved pet of Granny, who was always seen throwing food into the ocean when she was near it.

Though somewhat wary of the visitors, the hyraxes quickly warm up to the Sub-Zero Heroes. Manny feels that, if the hyraxes helped them, they could defeat the pirates; unfortunately, the hyraxes are unable to comprehend English and misinterpret Manny's request as asking for food. Eventually, Sid is able to communicate to them that an alliance is necessary if the other hyraxes are to be freed and the pirates are to be defeated, much to the surprise of Manny and Diego.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}).

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father). [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable: ''\u043f\u043b\u00e1\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8p\u026banina]}}: mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u045d\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430'' ({{IPA|[p\u026ba\u02c8ninata]}}: the mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[p\u026bani\u02c8narit\u025b]}}: the mountaineers).<ref name=\"usikova109\" /> There are several exceptions to the rule and they include: [[Participle|verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with ''-\u045c\u0438''): e.g. ''\u0432\u0438\u043a\u00e1\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8kajci]}}: shouting), ''\u043e\u0434\u00e9\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[\u0254\u02c8d\u025bjci]}}: walking); adverbs of time: ''\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0432\u0430'' ({{IPA|[godi\u02c8nava]}}: this year), ''\u043b\u0435\u0442\u00f3\u0432\u043e'' ({{IPA|[le\u02c8tovo]}}: this summer); foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. ''\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u00e9'' ({{IPA|[kli\u02c8\u0283\u025b]}}:clich\u00e9), ''\u0433\u0435\u043d\u00e9\u0437\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u0261\u025b\u02c8n\u025bza]}} genesis), ''\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u00fd\u0440\u0430'' ({{IPA|[lit\u025bra\u02c8tura]}}: literature), ''\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u00e1\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440'' ({{IPA|[al\u025bk\u02c8sandar]}}, [[Alexander]]).\n\nLinking occurs when two or more words are pronounced with only stress and is a common feature of the Macedonian language. This linguistic phenomenon is called ''\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442'' and is denoted with a (\u035c ) sign. Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms or the future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' are used in-between (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435''), some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) and others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''. Examples of personal pronouns are shown below:\n*Personal pronoun: '''''\u0408\u0430\u0441''' \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word. These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) word order which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the OVS forms as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences can be used to give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

Misirkov was born in a village [[Pella (modern)|Postol]] in Ottoman Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's ''On Macedonian Matters'', published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a [[phonemic orthography]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently North Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[second World War]], most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and [[liturgies]].

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney. After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, under the auspices of some Macedonian intellectuals in [[Bucharest]], anti-Yugoslav,  ''non-[[serbianisation|serbianised]]'' alphabet, grammar, and primer were created.<ref>Keith Brown, Macedonia's Child-grandfathers: The Transnational Politics of Memory, Exile, and Return, 1948-1998; Henry M.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /''\u0435''/ and /''\u043e''/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [\u025b] to [\u1eb9] and from [o] to [\u1ecd]. Unstressed vowels are not [[vowel reduction|reduced]], although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable.{{sfn|Friedman|1998|p=252}}<ref name=\"gramatika\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001}}</ref> The five vowels and the letter /''\u0440''/ which acts as a [[semivowel]] when found between two consonants (e.g. ''\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430'', \"church\"), can be syllable-forming.<ref name=\"usikova111\" /> \n\nThe [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|\u028c}} or {{IPAblink|\u0268}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\"/> When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|\u043a\u2019\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442}}, {{angbr|\u0441\u2019\u043d\u0446\u0435}}, etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]]}} ({{IPA|[\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025br]}}) and {{angbr|\u041c\u0422}} ({{IPA|[\u025bm.t\u025b]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. [[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}; e.g. {{angbr|\u0441\u0430\u0430\u0442}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[sa\u02d0t]}} '''colloq.'' hour', {{angbr|\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0438}} - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father).

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) word order which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the OVS forms as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences can be used to give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

Although the written language, now called [[Church Slavonic]], remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,<ref>[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112190002/http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 |date=2013-11-12 }}, {{ISSN|1312-6172}}, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 2010, \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 XVI \u0438 XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a.</ref> can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.<ref>[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro.

His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of [[Bulgarian dialects]]: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and North Macedonia).

Misirkov was born in a village [[Pella (modern)|Postol]] in Ottoman Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's ''On Macedonian Matters'', published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a [[phonemic orthography]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently North Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[second World War]], most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and [[liturgies]].

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney. After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, under the auspices of some Macedonian intellectuals in [[Bucharest]], anti-Yugoslav,  ''non-[[serbianisation|serbianised]]'' alphabet, grammar, and primer were created.<ref>Keith Brown, Macedonia's Child-grandfathers: The Transnational Politics of Memory, Exile, and Return, 1948-1998; Henry M.
