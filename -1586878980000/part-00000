Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New Alliance Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1990|New York state election, 1990]], was held on November 6.  Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] and Lieutenant Governor [[Stan Lundine]] were re-elected, both Democrats. The elections to the other two statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the two incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, and a Democratic Attorney General. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,086,000; Republicans 866,000; Conservatives 828,000; Right to Life 138,000; Liberals 71,000; New Alliance 31,000; Libertarians 25,000; and Socialist Workers 13,000.\n\n22 of the sitting 23 women members of the legislature\u2014State Senators [[Mary B.

Glick]] (Dem.), of [[Manhattan]]; [[Susan V. John]] (Dem.), of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; and [[Frances T. Sullivan]] (Rep.), of [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]]; were also elected to the Assembly.\n\nThe New York state election, 1991, was held on November 5. Three vacancies in the Assembly were filled. Assemblywoman [[Helen M. Marshall]] was elected to the [[New York City Council]].\n\nOn January 28, 1992, [[Joni A. Yoswein]] (Dem.), of [[Brooklyn]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 189th Legislature began and ended with 28 women members, setting a new record.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the first regular session (the 214th) at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 9, 1991;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/nyregion/cuomo-prescribes-austerity-not-activism.html ''Cuomo Prescribes Austerity, Not Activism''] by Kevin Sack, in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 10, 1991</ref> and recessed indefinitely in the early morning of July 4.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/05/nyregion/political-memo-cuomo-s-tax-shift-reflects-fiscal-squeeze.html ''Cuomo's Tax Shift Reflects Fiscal Squeeze''] by Kevin Sack, in ''The New York Times'' on July 5, 1991</ref>\n\n[[Mel Miller]] (Dem.) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]].\n\n[[Ralph J.

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New Alliance Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1990|New York state election, 1990]], was held on November 6.  Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] and Lieutenant Governor [[Stan Lundine]] were re-elected, both Democrats. The elections to the other two statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the two incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, and a Democratic Attorney General. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,086,000; Republicans 866,000; Conservatives 828,000; Right to Life 138,000; Liberals 71,000; New Alliance 31,000; Libertarians 25,000; and Socialist Workers 13,000.\n\n22 of the sitting 23 women members of the legislature\u2014State Senators [[Mary B.

Glick]] (Dem.), of [[Manhattan]]; [[Susan V. John]] (Dem.), of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; and [[Frances T. Sullivan]] (Rep.), of [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]]; were also elected to the Assembly.\n\nThe New York state election, 1991, was held on November 5. Three vacancies in the Assembly were filled. Assemblywoman [[Helen M. Marshall]] was elected to the [[New York City Council]].\n\nOn January 28, 1992, [[Joni A. Yoswein]] (Dem.), of [[Brooklyn]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 189th Legislature began and ended with 28 women members, setting a new record.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the first regular session (the 214th) at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 9, 1991;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/10/nyregion/cuomo-prescribes-austerity-not-activism.html ''Cuomo Prescribes Austerity, Not Activism''] by Kevin Sack, in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on January 10, 1991</ref> and recessed indefinitely in the early morning of July 4.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/05/nyregion/political-memo-cuomo-s-tax-shift-reflects-fiscal-squeeze.html ''Cuomo's Tax Shift Reflects Fiscal Squeeze''] by Kevin Sack, in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on July 5, 1991</ref>\n\n[[Mel Miller]] (Dem.) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]].\n\n[[Ralph J.

Following the Balkan Conference held in Moscow in autumn 1923, he settled in the Soviet Union and was appointed deputy rapporteur of the ECCI for the [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries.{{sfn|B\u0103dulescu|2011|p=1081}} In 1924 he was admitted in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]], and later that year participated in Romanian Communist Party's third congress, which took place in [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Lazi\u0107|Drachkovitch|1986|p=326}} During most of the interwar, Moscu remained the RCP permanent delegate to the Comintern.{{sfn|Tism\u0103neanu|2003|p=274}} and in 1927 he was also appointed a member in the Balkan Secretariat of the Comintern. \n\nIn 1929, during the intense factional fights which divided the Romanian Communist Party, Moscu left he Comintern apparatus and, after taking some university courses in commerce, he led the international section of the Soviet [[State Committee for Standards and Product Quality Management|National Committee of Standardization]]. After September 1932, when the section was disbanded, he worked as the assistant manager of the international section of the [[People's Commissariat for Communications of the USSR]]. Temporarily excluded from the Communist Party, Moscu had to leave this position and start working as a consulting editor for the ''Co-operative Publishing Society of Foreign Workers in the USSR''.{{sfn|B\u0103dulescu|2011|p=1082}} Expelled again from the Party in 1935, he was eventually killed in 1937, during the [[Great Purge]], accused of creating a spy ring inside the ECCI. He was later rehabilitated, first in the [[USSR]] and then in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], during the [[de-stalinization]] campaigns in the [[Eastern Bloc]].{{sfn|Lazi\u0107|Drachkovitch|1986|p=326}}{{sfn|Stolarik|2010|p=240}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last1=B\u0103dulescu|first1=Alexandru|editor1-last=Fene\u0219an|editor1-first=Costin|title=Sub steag str\u0103in|year=2011|publisher=[[Editura Enciclopedic\u0103]]|location=Bucure\u0219ti|isbn=9789734506293|pages=1080-1082|chapter=Autobiografie|language=Romanian|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=B\u0103rbulescu|first1=C.|last2=Dragne|first2=Fl.|last3=Mocanu|first3=C|title=File din istoria UTC|year=1971|publisher=[[Editura Politic\u0103]]|location=Bucharest|language=Romanian|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Lazi\u0107|first1=Branko M.|last2=Drachkovitch|first2=Milorad M.|title=Biographical dictionary of the Comintern|year=1986|publisher=[[Hoover Press]]|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Stolarik|first1=M.
