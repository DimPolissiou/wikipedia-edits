A skillful batsmen and accomplished captain, Azharuddin is ultimately remembered as one of few players to be involved with multiple match-fixing scandals, and one of the most divisive sportsman alive. Some who watched him play would swear no other batsman could match his elegance. To others, he was a traitor to India and sold his country for money. Despite initial confusion, he eventually confessed to throwing matches in exchange for money, while also involving former South African Captain Hansie Cronje.<ref name=\"sportskeeda.com\">https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/mohammad-azharuddin-match-fixer-full-story-his-ban-lifted</ref><ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/4774886/Azharuddin-confesses-all.html</ref>\n\nHe was known for his wristy strokeplay, much like Indian cricketer [[Gundappa Viswanath|Vishwanath]] and Pakistani cricketer [[Zaheer Abbas]]. Azharuddin made his debut for the [[Indian national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] in [[Test cricket]] in 1984 against [[England national cricket team|England]] at [[Eden Gardens]] in [[Kolkata]] on 31 December 1984, where he scored 110 in his first innings from 322 deliveries, alongside Ravi Shastri who scored 111, in what was ultimately a drawn match. He subsequently scored two more centuries in his next two innings. Azhar is remembered for an aggressive 121 against [[England]] at [[Lord's]] in 1990. India was faced with the prospect of a follow-on when Azhar came in to bat at number five, and brought up his hundred off 88 balls in a losing cause. Former England cricketer [[Vic Marks]] called it \"the most dazzling Test century\" he had ever witnessed, in his column in ''[[the Observer]]''.<ref name=\"guardian1\">{{cite web |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |title=The Joy of Six: England v India memories |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jul/22/joy-of-six-england-india-cricket |website=The Guardian |accessdate=12 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012182454/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jul/22/joy-of-six-england-india-cricket |archivedate=12 October 2018 |language=en |date=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nPredominantly a middle order batsman, Azharuddin was known for his attacking brand of cricket and strong slip catching, though continuously struggled against the short ball. Azharuddin played 99 test matches for India and scored 6,215 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 45.03, including 22 centuries and 21 half centuries. His record in [[One Day International|ODIs]] was more impressive, with 9,378 runs from 334 matches at an average of 36.92. As a fielder, he took 156 catches in [[One Day International|ODI cricket]]. Azharuddin started his career with a 110 [[English cricket team in India in 1984-85#3rd Test|against England]] in Kolkata in 1984 and ended with a 102 [[South African cricket team in India in 1999\u20132000#2nd Test|against South Africa]] in Banglaore in 2000 thus, becoming the only Indian and the fifth batsman ever to score a century in his first and last Test matches.\n\nAzharuddin was convicted of match fixing in 2000, and banned for life by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]]. During India's 2000 tour of South Africa, a series that was won by South Africa 3\u20132, Azharuddin scored 112 runs at an average of 28.<ref name=\"sportskeeda.com\"/> Other key Indian crickers whom Azharuddin groomed and also brought into the match-fixing fold displayed similarly dismal performances.\n\n===Captaincy===\nAzharuddin became the captain of the [[Indian national cricket team|Indian team]] succeeding [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]] in 1989.

who was the Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha from [[Moradabad (Lok Sabha Constituency)|Moradabad]].  He was renowned as an elegant middle-order [[batsman]] and captain of the [[Indian cricket team]] in 99 tests and 174 one day matches during the 1990s. His international playing career came to an end when he was found to be involved in a [[South Africa cricket match fixing|match-fixing scandal]] in 2000 and subsequently banned by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] for life. In 2012, the [[Andhra Pradesh High Court]] declared the life ban illegal. A division bench of the high court set aside the order of the City Civil Court, which had upheld the ban after Azharuddin had challenged it. But by then he was 49 years old and too old to get back on the pitch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Andhra Pradesh High Court Clears Azhar |url=https://www.thequint.com/sports/the-mohammad-azharuddin-timeline-how-the-cricketer-went-downhill |website=thequint.com |accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Wisden India\">{{cite news|url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/ap-high-court-lifts-azharuddins-life-ban/34123|title=AP high court lifts ban on Azharuddin|work= Wisden India|date=8 November 2012|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> He said he was happy the issue was over and done with, and he would not be taking any further legal action: \"It was a long drawn out legal case and it was painful.

A skillful batsmen and accomplished captain, Azharuddin is ultimately remembered as one of few players to be involved with multiple match-fixing scandals, and one of the most divisive sportsman alive. Some who watched him play would swear no other batsman could match his elegance. To others, he was a traitor to India and sold his country for money. Despite initial confusion, he eventually confessed to throwing matches in exchange for money, while also involving former South African Captain Hansie Cronje.<ref name=\"sportskeeda.com\">https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/mohammad-azharuddin-match-fixer-full-story-his-ban-lifted</ref><ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/4774886/Azharuddin-confesses-all.html</ref>\n\nHe was known for his wristy strokeplay, much like Indian cricketer [[Gundappa Viswanath|Vishwanath]] and Pakistani cricketer [[Zaheer Abbas]]. Azharuddin made his debut for the [[Indian national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] in [[Test cricket]] in 1984 against [[England national cricket team|England]] at [[Eden Gardens]] in [[Kolkata]] on 31 December 1984, where he scored 110 in his first innings from 322 deliveries, alongside Ravi Shastri who scored 111, in what was ultimately a drawn match. He subsequently scored two more centuries in his next two innings. Azhar is remembered for an aggressive 121 against [[England]] at [[Lord's]] in 1990. India was faced with the prospect of a follow-on when Azhar came in to bat at number five, and brought up his hundred off 88 balls in a losing cause. Former England cricketer [[Vic Marks]] called it \"the most dazzling Test century\" he had ever witnessed, in his column in ''[[the Observer]]''.<ref name=\"guardian1\">{{cite web |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |title=The Joy of Six: England v India memories |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jul/22/joy-of-six-england-india-cricket |website=The Guardian |accessdate=12 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012182454/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jul/22/joy-of-six-england-india-cricket |archivedate=12 October 2018 |language=en |date=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nPredominantly a middle order batsman, Azharuddin was known for his attacking brand of cricket and strong slip catching, though continuously struggled against the short ball. Azharuddin played 99 test matches for India and scored 6,215 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 45.03, including 22 centuries and 21 half centuries. His record in [[One Day International|ODIs]] was more impressive, with 9,378 runs from 334 matches at an average of 36.92. As a fielder, he took 156 catches in [[One Day International|ODI cricket]]. Azharuddin started his career with a 110 [[English cricket team in India in 1984-85#3rd Test|against England]] in Kolkata in 1984 and ended with a 102 [[South African cricket team in India in 1999\u20132000#2nd Test|against South Africa]] in Banglaore in 2000 thus, becoming the only Indian and the fifth batsman ever to score a century in his first and last Test matches.\n\nAzharuddin was convicted of match fixing in 2000, and banned for life by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]]. During India's 2000 tour of South Africa, a series that was won by South Africa 3\u20132, Azharuddin scored 112 runs at an average of 28.<ref name=\"sportskeeda.com\"/> Other key Indian crickers whom Azharuddin groomed and also brought into the match-fixing fold displayed similarly dismal performances.\n\n===Captaincy===\nAzharuddin became the captain of the [[Indian national cricket team|Indian team]] succeeding [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]] in 1989.

This experiment was designed to assimilate Native Americans to the majority culture. The federal government proposed to divide communal lands into plots assignable to heads of household \u2013 tribal members \u2013 for their subsistence farming, in the pattern of small family farms common among European Americans. The land allocated to Navajos was initially not considered as part of the reservation. Further, the government determined that land \"left over\" after all members had received allotments was to be considered \"surplus\" and available for sale to non-Native Americans. The allotment program continued until 1934.  Today, this patchwork of reservation and non-reservation land is called \"the checkerboard\" area.<ref name=\"nav-pol-ex\">Wilkins, David Eugene.

Twenty-two of these ranches are located within New Mexico and three ranches are located in Arizona.\n[[File:Chief Manuelito.jpg|thumb|Navajo Chief]]\n END OF COMMENTING OUT-->In the southeastern area of the reservation, the Navajo Nation has purchased some ranches, which it calls its ''Nahata Dzil'' or New Lands. They are leased to Navajo individuals, livestock and grazing associations, and livestock companies.\n\nIn 1996, [[Elouise Cobell]] ([[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]]) filed a class action suit against the federal government on behalf of an estimated 250,000\u2013500,000 plaintiffs, Native Americans whose trust accounts did not reflect an accurate accounting of monies owed them under leases or fees on trust lands. The settlement of ''[[Cobell v. Salazar]]'' in 2009 included a provision for a nearly $2 billion fund for the government to buy fractionated interests and restore land to tribal reservations. Individuals could sell their fractionated land interests on a voluntary basis, at market rates, through this program if their tribe participated.\n\nThrough March 2017,  under the Tribal Nations Buy-Back Program, individual Navajo members received $104 million for purchase of their interests in land; 155,503 acres were returned to the Navajo Nation for its territory by the Department of Interior under this program.<ref name=\"buyback\">[https://www.doi.gov//sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/table_lbbtn_transactions_through_march_31_2017.pdf] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}</ref> The program is intended to help tribes restore the land bases of their reservations. Almost 11,000 Navajo citizens were paid for their interests under this program.<ref name=\"buyback\"/> The tribe intends to use the consolidated lands to \"streamline infrastructure projects,\" such as running power lines.\n\n===Clan governance===\n<!-- Needs expansion -->\nIn the traditional Navajo culture, local leadership was organized around [[clans]], which are [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] groups. Children are considered born into the mother's family and gain their social status from her.\n\nThe clan leadership have served as a ''de facto'' government on the local level of the Navajo Nation.\n\n====Rejection of Indian Reorganization Act====\nIn 1933 during the Great Depression, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) attempted to mitigate environmental damage due to over-grazing on reservations. This created an environment of misunderstanding, as its representatives did not consult sufficiently with the Navajo. BIA Superintendent [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]]'s attempt to reduce livestock herd size affected responses to his other efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans, as the herds were central to Navajo culture, and were a source of prestige.<ref>{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref>\n\nAlso during this period, under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) of 1934, the federal government was encouraging tribes to revive their governments according to constitutional models shaped after the United States. Because of the outrage and discontent about the herd issues, the Navajo voters did not trust the language of the proposed initial constitution outlined in the legislation. This contributed to their rejection of the first version of a proposed tribal constitution.\n\nIn the various attempts since, members found the process to be too cumbersome and a potential threat to tribal self-determination, as the constitution was supposed to be reviewed and approved by BIA. The earliest efforts were rejected primarily because segments of the tribe did not find enough freedom in the proposed forms of government. In 1935 they feared that the proposed government would hinder development and recovery of their livestock industries; in 1953 they worried about restrictions on development of mineral resources.\n\nThey continued a government based on traditional models, with headmen chosen by clan groups.\n\n==Navajo Nation and Federal Government Jurisdictions==\n[[Image:Window rock AZ.jpg|thumb|right|{{spell-nv|Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed}}, the \"Window Rock\"]]\nThe United States still asserts [[plenary authority|plenary power]] and thus requires the territory of the Navajo Nation to submit all proposed laws to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] for [[Secretarial Review]], through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA).\n\nThe US Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'' (1889) affirmed that Congress has [[plenary power]] over all Indian tribes within United States borders, saying that \"The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=118&invol=375 |title=''U.S. v Kagama'', 118 U.S. 375 (1886), Filed May 10, 1886 |publisher=FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business |accessdate=2012-04-29 }}</ref> It noted that the tribes did not owe allegiance to the states within which their reservations were located.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/375/ |title=''United States v.

The Navajo Nation Code comprises the rules and laws of the Navajo Nation as currently codified in the latest edition.\n\nLands within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Nation are composed of Public, Tribal Trust, Tribal Fee, [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), Private, State, and BIA Indian Allotment Lands. On the Arizona and Utah portions of the Navajo Nation, there are a few private and BIA Indian Allotments in comparison to New Mexico's portion which consists of a checkerboard pattern of all the aforementioned lands. The Eastern Agency, as it is referred to, consists of primarily Tribal Fee, BIA Indian Allotments, and BLM Lands. Although there are more Tribal Fee Lands in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation government intends to convert most or all Tribal Fee Lands to Tribal Trust.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Tom O'Halleran with Navajo leaders 2020.jpg|thumb|Vice President Myron Lizer, Congressman [[Tom O'Halleran]] and President [[Jonathan Nez]] in 2020.]]\nThe Title II Amendment of 1989 established the Navajo Nation government as a three-part system (changes to the judicial branch had already begun in 1958).

The committee was formed by former Navajo leaders: Kelsey Begaye, Peterson Zah, [[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald]], writer/social activist Ivan Gamble, and other local political activists.<ref>Lee, Tanya.

Each Chapter elected officers and followed parliamentary procedures.\n\nBy 1933, more than 100 chapters operated across the territory. The chapters served as liaisons between the Navajo and the federal government, and also acted as precincts for the elections of tribal council delegates. They served as forums for local tribal leaders. But, the chapters had no authority within the structure of the Navajo Nation government.<ref>David E. Wilkins, ''The Navojo Political Experience,'' 1999, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Navajo Tribal Council passed the \"Local Governance Act,\" which expanded the political roles of the existing 110 chapters. It authorized them to make decisions on behalf of the chapter members and take over certain roles previously delegated to the council and executive branches. This included entering into intergovernmental agreements with federal, state and tribal entities, subject to approval by the Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Council.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\n====Agencies/Chapters====\nThe Navajo Nation is divided into five agencies across parts of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]], with the seat of government located at the Navajo Governmental Campus at [[Window Rock, Arizona|Window Rock/''Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed'']]. These agencies are similar to county entities and reflect the five [[United States Bureau of Indian Affairs|Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) agencies created in the early years of the Navajo Nation. The five agencies within the Navajo Nation are the Chinle Agency in [[Chinle, Arizona]]; Eastern Navajo Agency in [[Crownpoint, New Mexico]]; Western Navajo Agency in [[Tuba City, Arizona]]; Fort Defiance Agency in [[Fort Defiance, Arizona]]; and Shiprock Agency in [[Shiprock, New Mexico]]. The BIA agencies provide various technical services under direction of the BIA's Navajo Area Office at [[Gallup, New Mexico]]. \n\nAgencies are further divided into chapters as the smallest political unit, similar to municipalities. The Navajo capital city of Window Rock is located in the Chapter of [[St. Michaels, Arizona]]. \n\nThe Navajo Nation also has executive offices in the US capital of [[Washington, DC]] for lobbying services and congressional relations.\n\n====Departments and divisions====\n\n=====Law enforcement=====\n{{main|Navajo Nation Police}}\n[[File:Navajo Police Chevrolet Tahoe.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Navajo Police Chevrolet Tahoe]]\nThe Navajo law enforcement consists of roughly 300 tribal police officers with only 3 non-native officers.\n\nCertain classes of crimes, such as capital cases, are prosecuted and adjudicated in Federal courts. However, the Navajo Nation operates its own divisions of law enforcement via the Navajo Division of Public Safety, commonly referred to as the Navajo Nation Police (formerly Navajo Tribal Police). Law enforcement functions are also delegated to the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife: Wildlife Law Enforcement and Animal Control Sections; Navajo Nation Forestry Law Enforcement Officers; and the Navajo Nation EPA Criminal Enforcement Section; and Navajo Nation Resource Enforcement ([[Navajo Rangers]]).\n\nOther local, state and federal law enforcement agencies routinely work on the Navajo Nation, including the BIA Police, [[National Park Service]] U.S. Park Rangers, [[U.S. Forest Service]] Law Enforcement and Investigations, [[Bureau of Land Management]] Law Enforcement, [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), US Marshals, and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]; and other Native American units: the Ute Mountain Agency, and Hopi Agency; and [[Arizona Highway Patrol]], [[Utah Highway Patrol]], [[New Mexico Department of Public Safety]] (State Police and Highway Patrol), Apache County Sheriff's Office, Navajo County Sheriff's Office, McKinley County Sheriff's Office.\n\n=====Other agencies=====\n*Transportation\n*Health\n*Education\n\n====Regional Commissions====\nIn addition, regional government functions are carried out by the \"District Grazing Committees\" and \"Off-Reservation Land Boards\", \"Major Irrigation Projects Farm Boards\", and \"Agency Councils\".<ref>David E.

Congress appointed Utah as trustee on behalf of Navajos living in [[San Juan County, Utah]] for any potential revenues that came from natural resources in the area.

As the revenues and resulting expenditures increased, Utah created the 12 member Navajo Commission to do the operational work.

This experiment was designed to assimilate Native Americans to the majority culture. The federal government proposed to divide communal lands into plots assignable to heads of household \u2013 tribal members \u2013 for their subsistence farming, in the pattern of small family farms common among European Americans. The land allocated to Navajos was initially not considered as part of the reservation. Further, the government determined that land \"left over\" after all members had received allotments was to be considered \"surplus\" and available for sale to non-Native Americans. The allotment program continued until 1934.  Today, this patchwork of reservation and non-reservation land is called \"the checkerboard\" area.<ref name=\"nav-pol-ex\">Wilkins, David Eugene.

Twenty-two of these ranches are located within New Mexico and three ranches are located in Arizona.\n[[File:Chief Manuelito.jpg|thumb|Navajo Chief]]\n END OF COMMENTING OUT-->In the southeastern area of the reservation, the Navajo Nation has purchased some ranches, which it calls its ''Nahata Dzil'' or New Lands. They are leased to Navajo individuals, livestock and grazing associations, and livestock companies.\n\nIn 1996, [[Elouise Cobell]] ([[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]]) filed a class action suit against the federal government on behalf of an estimated 250,000\u2013500,000 plaintiffs, Native Americans whose trust accounts did not reflect an accurate accounting of monies owed them under leases or fees on trust lands. The settlement of ''[[Cobell v. Salazar]]'' in 2009 included a provision for a nearly $2 billion fund for the government to buy fractionated interests and restore land to tribal reservations. Individuals could sell their fractionated land interests on a voluntary basis, at market rates, through this program if their tribe participated.\n\nThrough March 2017,  under the Tribal Nations Buy-Back Program, individual Navajo members received $104 million for purchase of their interests in land; 155,503 acres were returned to the Navajo Nation for its territory by the Department of Interior under this program.<ref name=\"buyback\">[https://www.doi.gov//sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/table_lbbtn_transactions_through_march_31_2017.pdf] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}</ref> The program is intended to help tribes restore the land bases of their reservations.

Children are considered born into the mother's family and gain their social status from her.\n\nThe clan leadership have served as a ''de facto'' government on the local level of the Navajo Nation.\n\n====Rejection of Indian Reorganization Act====\nIn 1933 during the Great Depression, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) attempted to mitigate environmental damage due to over-grazing on reservations. This created an environment of misunderstanding, as its representatives did not consult sufficiently with the Navajo. BIA Superintendent [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]]'s attempt to reduce livestock herd size affected responses to his other efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans, as the herds were central to Navajo culture, and were a source of prestige.<ref>{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref>\n\nAlso during this period, under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) of 1934, the federal government was encouraging tribes to revive their governments according to constitutional models shaped after the United States. Because of the outrage and discontent about the herd issues, the Navajo voters did not trust the language of the proposed initial constitution outlined in the legislation. This contributed to their rejection of the first version of a proposed tribal constitution.\n\nIn the various attempts since, members found the process to be too cumbersome and a potential threat to tribal self-determination, as the constitution was supposed to be reviewed and approved by BIA. The earliest efforts were rejected primarily because segments of the tribe did not find enough freedom in the proposed forms of government. In 1935 they feared that the proposed government would hinder development and recovery of their livestock industries; in 1953 they worried about restrictions on development of mineral resources.\n\nThey continued a government based on traditional models, with headmen chosen by clan groups.\n\n==Navajo Nation and Federal Government Jurisdictions==\n[[Image:Window rock AZ.jpg|thumb|right|{{spell-nv|Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed}}, the \"Window Rock\"]]\nThe United States still asserts [[plenary authority|plenary power]] and thus requires the territory of the Navajo Nation to submit all proposed laws to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] for [[Secretarial Review]], through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA).\n\nThe US Supreme Court in ''[[United States v.

The Navajo Nation Code comprises the rules and laws of the Navajo Nation as currently codified in the latest edition.\n\nLands within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Nation are composed of Public, Tribal Trust, Tribal Fee, [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), Private, State, and BIA Indian Allotment Lands. On the Arizona and Utah portions of the Navajo Nation, there are a few private and BIA Indian Allotments in comparison to New Mexico's portion which consists of a checkerboard pattern of all the aforementioned lands. The Eastern Agency, as it is referred to, consists of primarily Tribal Fee, BIA Indian Allotments, and BLM Lands.

Each Chapter elected officers and followed parliamentary procedures.\n\nBy 1933, more than 100 chapters operated across the territory. The chapters served as liaisons between the Navajo and the federal government, and also acted as precincts for the elections of tribal council delegates. They served as forums for local tribal leaders. But, the chapters had no authority within the structure of the Navajo Nation government.<ref>David E. Wilkins, ''The Navojo Political Experience,'' 1999, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Navajo Tribal Council passed the \"Local Governance Act,\" which expanded the political roles of the existing 110 chapters. It authorized them to make decisions on behalf of the chapter members and take over certain roles previously delegated to the council and executive branches. This included entering into intergovernmental agreements with federal, state and tribal entities, subject to approval by the Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Council.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\n====Agencies/Chapters====\nThe Navajo Nation is divided into five agencies across parts of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]], with the seat of government located at the Navajo Governmental Campus at [[Window Rock, Arizona|Window Rock/''Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed'']]. These agencies are similar to county entities and reflect the five [[United States Bureau of Indian Affairs|Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) agencies created in the early years of the Navajo Nation. The five agencies within the Navajo Nation are the Chinle Agency in [[Chinle, Arizona]]; Eastern Navajo Agency in [[Crownpoint, New Mexico]]; Western Navajo Agency in [[Tuba City, Arizona]]; Fort Defiance Agency in [[Fort Defiance, Arizona]]; and Shiprock Agency in [[Shiprock, New Mexico]]. The BIA agencies provide various technical services under direction of the BIA's Navajo Area Office at [[Gallup, New Mexico]]. \n\nAgencies are further divided into chapters as the smallest political unit, similar to municipalities.

Most of these fields are located in the Aneth Extension in Utah but there are a few wells in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. The first well was drilled in the Aneth Extension in 1956. In 2006 the Paradox Basin fields were injected with water and Co2 to increase declining production.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/06/carbon-seq/Poster+046.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128100740/https://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/06/carbon-seq/Poster%20046.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-28 }}</ref> There are also wells in the Checkerboard area in New Mexico that are on leased land owned by individual Navajos.\n\nThe selling of leases and oil royalties have changed over the years.  The Aneth Extension was created from Public Domain lands as part a 1933 exchange for lands flooded by [[Lake Powell]].  Congress appointed Utah as trustee on behalf of Navajos living in [[San Juan County, Utah]] for any potential revenues that came from natural resources in the area. Utah initially created a 3-person committee to make leases, receive royalties and improve the living conditions for Utah Navajos.  As the revenues and resulting expenditures increased, Utah created the 12 member Navajo Commission to do the operational work.  The Navajo Nation and Bureau of Indian Affairs are also involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg74443/pdf/CHRG-112shrg74443.pdf|format=PDF|title=SF |website=Gpo.gov|accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are several Navajo organizations that deal with oil and gas.

Overall, around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States,  between 1820 and 1914, chiefly after national insurgencies and famine.<ref>Polonia ameryka\u0144ska, p. 40</ref> They included former Polish citizens of [[Roman Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Jews|Jewish]] or other minority descent. Exact immigration figures are unknown. Many immigrants were classified as \"Russian\", \"German\" or \"Austrian\" by the [[U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]] as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were under [[Partitions of Poland|Prussian, Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control]]. Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent. In 1940, about 50 percent married other American ethnics and a study in 1988 found that 54% of [[Polish Americans]] were of mixed ancestry from three generations or longer.

Some Jews from Poland even assimilated into cities which were Polish (and also other Slavic, and sometimes additionally Jewish) bastions in order to conceal their Jewish identities.<ref>See the reference to [[Anusim]]. Additionally, refer to the similar case of [[John Kerry]]'s paternal grandfather,  a Non-Polish subject whom immigrated to [[Boston]] and passed for a [[Czechs|Czech]]-Austrian Hungarian [[Catholic]]</ref>   \n#\n# From 1870 to 1914, Poles and Polish subjects formed a significant part of the wave of immigration from [[Germany]], [[Imperial Russia]], and [[Austria Hungary]].  The Ethnic Poles and Jews in particular came in family groups, settled in and/or blended into largely Polish neighborhoods and other Slavic bastions, and aspired to earn relatively high wages compared to what they could earn back in Europe (thus why many took the ample job opportunities for unskilled manual labor in industry and mining).  The main Ethnically-Polish-American organizations were founded because of high Polish interest in the [[Catholic church]], [[parochial school]]s, and local community affairs. Relatively few were politically active. \n#\n# Since 1914, the United States has seen mass emigration from Poland, and the coming of age of several generations of fully assimilated Polish Americans. Immigration from Poland has continued into the early 2000s, and began to decline after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The income levels have gone up from well below average, to above average.

They did not plan to remain permanently and become \"Americanized\". Instead, they came temporarily to earn money, invest, and wait for the right opportunity to return. Their intention was to ensure a desirable social status in the old world for themselves. However, many of the temporary migrants decided to become permanent Americans.\n\nMany found manual labor jobs in the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] and the heavy industries (steel mills, iron foundries, slaughterhouses, oil and sugar refineries), of the Great Lakes cities of [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]].\n\n===U.S. Census===\n[[File:1922 Detroit store.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Polish-American grocery, 1922, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].]]\nThe U.S. Census asked Polish immigrants to specify Polish as their native language beginning in Chicago in 1900, allowing the government to enumerate them as an individual nationality when there was no Polish nation-state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flps.newberry.org/article/5423968_8_0624|title=About the Population Census|website=Flps.newberry.org|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> No distinction is made in the American census between [[ethnic Poles|ethnically Polish Americans]] and descendants of non-ethnic Poles, such as Jews or Ukrainians, who were born in the territory of Poland and considered themselves Polish nationals. Therefore, some say, of the 10 million Polish Americans, only a certain portion are of Polish ethnic descent.  On the other hand, many ethnic Poles when entering the US from 1795 to 1917, when Poland did not exist, did not identify themselves as ethnic Poles and instead identified themselves as either German, Austrian or Russian (this pertained to the nations occupying Poland from 1795 to 1917). Therefore, the actual number of Americans of at least partial Polish ancestry, could be well over 10 million. In the 2011 United States Census Bureau's Population Estimates, there are between 9,365,239 and 9,530,571 Americans of Polish descent, with over 500,000 being foreign-born.<ref name=\"American FactFinder\"/>\n\nHistorically, Polish-Americans have assimilated very quickly to American society. Between 1940 and 1960, only 20 percent of the children of Polish-American ethnic leaders spoke Polish regularly, compared to 50 percent for Ukrainians.<ref>Bukowczyck, p. 108</ref> In the early 1960s, 3,000 of Detroit's 300,000 Polish-Americans changed their names each year. Language proficiency in Polish is rare in Polish-Americans, as 91.3% speak \"English only\".<ref name=\"American FactFinder\"/> In 1979, the 8 million respondents of Polish ancestry reported that only 41.5 percent had single ancestry, whereas 57.3% of Greeks, 52% of Italians and Sicilians, and 44% of Ukrainians had done so. Polish-Americans tended to marry exogamously in the postwar era in high numbers, and tended to marry within the Catholic population, often to persons of German (17%), Italian (10%), East European (8%), Irish (5%), French-Canadian (4%), Spanish-speaking (2%), Lithuanian (2%), and English (1%) ancestry.<ref>Bukowczyck, p. 109</ref>\n\n===Income===\nBy educational attainment, the U.S. Census estimates that 42.5% have bachelor's degrees or higher, whereas the American population as a whole is 32.0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212194457/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2011 |title=American FactFinder - Search |author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS) |accessdate=29 December 2018 }}</ref> The median household income for Americans of Polish descent is estimated by the U.S. Census as $73,452, with no statistically significant differences from other Slavic-American groups, Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian.

The influence of [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's Polish community]] is demonstrated by the numerous Polish-American organizations: the [[Polish Museum of America]], [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]] (the oldest Polish American fraternal organization in the United States), [[Polish American Association]], [[Polish American Congress]], [[Polish National Alliance]], [[Polish Falcons]], [[Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America]], and the [[Polish Genealogical Society of America]] . In addition, [[Illinois]] has more than one million people that are of Polish descent, the third largest ethnic group after the [[German American|German]] and [[Irish American]]s.\n\n[[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's Polish community]] is concentrated along the city's [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|Northwest]] and [[South Side (Chicago)|Southwest Sides]], along [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee]] and [[Archer Avenue (Chicago)|Archer Avenues]], respectively. Chicago's [[Taste of Polonia]] festival is celebrated at the [[Copernicus Foundation]], in [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]], every [[Labor Day]] weekend. Nearly 3 million people of Polish descent live in the area between Chicago and Detroit, including [[Northern Indiana]], a part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].  The community has played a role as a staunch supporter of the Democratic machine, and has been rewarded with several congressional seats.  The leading representative has been Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]], one of the most powerful members of Congress (1959 to 1995), especially on issues of taxation, before he went to prison.<ref>Tomasz Inglot, and John P.

St. Theresa's Roman Catholic Church offers Polish-language Mass. \n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, up to and immediately following the second  World War, Newark, New Jersey and Elizabeth, New Jersey were the primary, historic centers of 'Polonia' as Polish-Americans of that era thought of themselves. Castle Garden and Ellis Island generation immigrants and those that followed them found employment in the industries of these two cities as well as Linden which housed oil refineries and auto manufacturing. Initial settlements were in Newark, primariliy the \"Ironbound\" section, where St. Stanislaw Roman Catholic Church, followed by Casimir's Parish were the first parish churches founded and built by the communities there.  In Elizabeth, the first parish serving the Polish community is St. Adalbert's Roman Catholic Church.  All these parishes are over 100 years old, dating from the late 1800s, with churches constructed in the early 20th century. Post-war prosperity allowed many Polish Americans to disperse from the original core in New Jersey's industrial areas to the surrounding suburban communities. Documentation of their early history may be found on individual parkish websites.Other significant centers of Polish settlement in New Jersey included Garfield, New Jersey, Manville in Somerset County, Trenton, New Jersey, and Camden, New Jersey.\n\n====Other areas====\n\nIn [[Hudson County]], [[New Jersey]], [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] houses New Jersey's largest Polish American community, while [[Wallington, New Jersey|Wallington]] in [[Bergen County]], New Jersey contains the state's highest percentage of Polish Americans and one of the highest percentages in the United States, at over 40%. However, within New Jersey, Polish populations are additionally increasing rapidly in [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], [[Passaic County]] as well as in [[Garfield, New Jersey|Garfield]], Bergen County.\n\n[[Riverhead, New York]], located on eastern [[Long Island]], contains a neighborhood known as ''Polish Town'', where many Polish immigrants have continued to settle since the [[World War II]] era; the town has Polish [[architecture]], stores, and St. Isidore's R.C.

Historian John Radzilowski estimates that up to a third of Poles in Minnesota settled in rural areas, where they established 40 communities, that were often centered around a Catholic church.<ref>John Radzilowski. ''Poles in Minnesota.'' St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society, 2005. p.  6</ref> Most of these settlers came from the Polish lands that had been taken by Prussia during the Partitions, with a sub-group coming from Silesia. The Kaszub minority, from Poland's Baltic coast, was also strongly represented among Polish immigrants to Minnesota, most notably in Winona.  Despite relative isolation from Poland and larger urban Polonian communities, due to strong community integration these communities retained Polish language use into the 1970s in some cases and continue to have a strong Polish identity.\n\n===Michigan===\n{{see also|History of the Polish Americans in Metro Detroit}}\n[[Michigan]]'s Polish population of more than 850,000 is the third-largest among [[U.S. state|US states]], behind that of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]]. Polish Americans make up 8.6% of Michigan's total population. The city of [[Detroit]] has a very large Polish community, which historically settled in [[Poletown, Detroit|Poletown]] and [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] on the east side of Detroit, the neighborhoods along Michigan Avenue from 23rd street into east Dearborn, the west side of Delray, parts of Warrendale  and several sections of Wyandotte downriver. The northern part of Poletown was cleared of residents, to make way for the [[General Motors]] [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] plant. Today it contains some of the most opulent Polish churches in America like St. Stanislaus, Sweetest Heart of Mary, St. Albertus, St. Josephat and St. Hyacinthe. Michigan as a state has Polish populations throughout. In addition to [[metropolitan Detroit]], Grand Rapids, Bay City, Alpena and the surrounding area, the thumb of Michigan, Manistee, and numerous places in northern lower Michigan and south-central Michigan also have sizable Polish populations.\n\nThe Polish influence is still felt throughout the entire metropolitan Detroit area, especially the suburb of [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]], which is slowly emerging as the major center of Polish American activities in the state. An increase in new immigration from Poland is helping to bolster the parish community of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and a host of Polish American civic organizations, located within the city of Wyandotte. Also, the Detroit suburb of [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]] is home to the American Polish Cultural Center, where the [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] has over 200 artifacts on display from over 100 inductees, including [[Stan Musial]] and [[Mike Krzyzewski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishsportshof.com/ccpresense.html|title=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame Artifacts on Display at the American Polish Cultural Center|accessdate=2009-02-23|publisher=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[St. Mary's Preparatory]], a high school in [[Orchard Lake, Michigan|Orchard Lake]] with historically Polish roots, sponsors a popular annual Polish County Fair that bills itself as \"America's Largest High School Fair.\"\n\n===Ohio===\n[[File:Lagrange street Polish Festival items booth.JPG|thumbnail|Polish and Polish themed items booth at the Lagrange Street Polish Festival in [[Toledo, Ohio]].|300px]]\n[[Ohio]] is home to more than 440,000 people of Polish descent, their presence felt most strongly in the [[Greater Cleveland]] area, where half of Ohio's Polish population resides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP02&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212212624/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP02&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 February 2020|title=American FactFinder - Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|website=Factfinder2.census.gov|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] has a large Polish community, especially in historic [[Slavic Village]], as part of its Warszawa Section.

Many of these Poles return to their Polish roots, by attending masses at [[St. Stanislaus Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|St. Stanislaus Church]], on East 65th Street and Baxter Avenue. Poles in Cleveland celebrate the annual Harvest Festival, which is usually held at the end of August. It features [[polka]] music, Polish food and all things Polish.

After seeing fellow Poles discriminated against by Cleveland's banks, Ben Stefanski formed Third Federal. Today the Stefanski family still controls the bank. Unlike Cleveland's [[KeyBank]] and [[National City Corp.]], which have their headquarters in [[Downtown Cleveland]], Third Federal is on Broadway Avenue in the [[Slavic Village]] neighborhood. Third Federal Savings and Loan is in the top 25 saving and loan institutions in the United States. In 2003, they acquired a [[Florida]] banking company and have branches in Florida and Ohio.\n\n=== Texas ===\n[[Panna Maria, Texas]] was founded by Upper Silesian settlers on Christmas Eve in 1854.

Many of the immigrants were drawn to this area, because of the mining of [[Anthracite]] coal in the region. Polish influences are still common today, in the form of church bazaars, [[polka]] music, and [[Polish cuisine]]. It is widely believed that [[Boothwyn, Pennsylvania]], has one of the fastest growing Polish communities in the United States.\n\nIn 2007, at the urging of Attorney Adrian Baron and the local Polonia Business Association, New Britain, Connecticut officially designated its Broad Street neighborhood as ''Little Poland'', where an estimated 30,000 residents claim Polish heritage.

Replicas of the painting are common in Polish American churches and parishes, and many churches and parishes are named in her honor. The veneration of the Virgin Mary in Polish parishes is a significant difference between Polish Catholicism and Catholicism; Polish nuns in the [[Felician Sisters|Felician Order]] for instance, took to Marianism as the cornerstone of their spiritual development, and Polish churches in the U.S. were seen as \"cult-like\" in their veneration of Mary.<ref name=\"marythemessiah\">Mary the Messiah: Polish Immigrant Heresy and the Malleable Ideology of the Roman Catholic Church, 1880-1930. John J. Bukowczyk. Journal of American Ethnic History. Vol. 4, No. 2 (Spring, 1985), pp. 5-32</ref> Religious catechism and writings from convents found that Polish nuns in the Felician Sisters and The Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth were taught to have \"a sound appreciation of Mary's [[Co-Redemptrix|role in the mystery of the Redemption]] and ...a filial confidence in her patronage,\" more explicitly, to be \"a true daughter to the immaculate Virgin Mary\". The Marianism that was taught in Polish parish schools in the United States was done independent of the Catholic Church, and demonstrated autonomy on the part of the nuns who taught Polish American youths. It is notable that there was a concurrent movement in Poland that eventually led to a separatist Catholic church, the [[Mariavite Church]], which greatly expanded the veneration of the Virgin Mary in its doctrine. In Poland, the Virgin Mary was believed to serve as a mother of mercy and salvation for Catholics, and throughout the Middle Ages, Polish knights prayed to her before battle. Polish American churches featured replicas of the [[Black Madonna|Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa]], which was on feature at the [[Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery]] and holds national and religious significance because of its connection to a victorious military defense in 1655. Several towns in America are named [[Cz\u0119stochowa]], in commemoration of the town in Poland.<ref name=\"marythemessiah\"/>\n\nThough the majority of Polish Americans remained loyal to the Catholic Church, a [[Polish National Catholic Church|breakaway Catholic church]] was founded in 1897 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Polish parishioners founded the church to assert independence from the Catholic Church in America. The split was in rebellion from the church leadership, then dominated by Irish bishops and priests, and lacking in Polish language speakers and Polish church leaders. It exists today with 25,000 parishioners and remains independent from the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nPoland is also home to followers of [[Protestantism]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Small groups of both of these groups also immigrated to the United States. One of the most celebrated painters of religious icons in North America today is a Polish American Eastern Orthodox priest, Fr. [[Theodore Jurewicz]], who singlehandedly painted [[New Gra\u010danica Monastery]] in [[Third Lake, Illinois]], over the span of three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgracanica.com/monastery.htm|title=Serbian Monastery of New Gracanica \u2013 History|website=Newgracanica.com|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221012143/http://www.newgracanica.com/monastery.htm|archivedate=21 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nA small group of [[Lipka Tatars]], originating from the [[Bia\u0142ystok]] region, helped co-found the first [[Muslim]] organization in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1907 and later, a [[mosque]], which is still in use.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758343,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: Ramadan | date=1937-11-15 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Poland\u2013United States relations}}\n\n===Anti-Polonism===\n{{main|Antipolonism}}\nThe Polish community was long the subject of [[anti-Polish sentiment]] in America.

Roman Catholic churches built by Polish American communities often serve as a vehicle for cultural retention.\n\nDuring the 1950s\u20131970s, the Polish wedding was often an all-day event. Traditional Polish weddings in [[Chicago metropolitan area]], in areas such as the southeast side of Chicago, inner suburbs like Calumet City and Hegewisch, and [[Northwest Indiana]] suburbs, such as Whiting, Hammond and East Chicago, always occurred on Saturdays. The receptions were typically held in a large hall, such as a VFW Hall. A polka band of drums, a singer, accordion, and trumpet, entertained the people, as they danced traditional dances, such as the oberek, \"Polish Hop\" and the waltz. Always an important part of Slavic culture, food played a very important role. The musicians, as well as the guests, were expected to enjoy ample amounts of both food and drink. Foods, such as Polish sausage, sauerkraut, pierogi and kluski were common. Common drinks were beer, screwdrivers and highballs. Many popular Polish foods became a fixture in the American cuisine of today, including [[kielbasa|kie\u0142basa]] (Polish sausage), [[babka (food)|babka]] cake, [[kaszanka]] (kasanzka) and [[pierogi]].\n\nPolish American cultural groups include  [[Polish American Arts Association]] and the [[Polish Falcons]].\n\nAmong the many Polish American writers are a number of poets, such as [[Phil Boiarski]], [[Hedwig Gorski]], [[John Guzlowski]], [[John Minczeski]], [[Linda Nemec Foster]], [[Leonard Kress]] (poet and translator), [[Cecilia Woloch]], [[Kim Kikel]] and [[Mark Pawlak]] (poet and editor), along with novelists [[Leslie Pietrzyk]], [[Thad Rutkowski]], [[Suzanne Strempek Shea]]<ref name=\"PAHA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/resources.html|title=Polish American Historical Association - Resources and Supported Links|website=Polishamericanstudies.org|accessdate=28 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125204643/http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/resources.html|archive-date=2017-11-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> and others.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:20070822 Polish Museum.JPG|thumb|220px|left|The [[Polish Museum of America]] in [[Chicago]]. ]]\nAmong the best known Polish American museums are the [[Polish Museum of America]] in Chicago's old [[Polish Downtown]]; founded in 1935, the largest ethnic museum in the U.S. sponsored by the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]].

Distinctive cultural phenomena such as [[Polish flat]]s or the [[Polish Cathedral style]] of architecture became part and parcel of the areas where Polish settlement occurred.\n\nPoles' cultural ties to Roman Catholicism has also influenced the adoption of such distinctive rites like the blessing of the baskets before Easter in many areas of the United States by fellow Roman Catholics.\n\n===Architectural influence===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The John Gawlik House.jpg|thumb|left|High-pitched roofs were a common feature in Polish architecture.

Overall, around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States,  between 1820 and 1914, chiefly after national insurgencies and famine.<ref>Polonia ameryka\u0144ska, p. 40</ref> They included former Polish citizens of [[Roman Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Jews|Jewish]] or other minority descent. Exact immigration figures are unknown. Many immigrants were classified as \"Russian\", \"German\" or \"Austrian\" by the [[U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]] as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were under [[Partitions of Poland|Prussian, Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control]]. Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent. In 1940, about 50 percent married other American ethnics and a study in 1988 found that 54% of [[Polish Americans]] were of mixed ancestry from three generations or longer.

Some Jews from Poland even assimilated into cities which were Polish (and also other Slavic, and sometimes additionally Jewish) bastions in order to conceal their Jewish identities.<ref>See the reference to [[Anusim]]. Additionally, refer to the similar case of [[John Kerry]]'s paternal grandfather,  a Non-Polish subject whom immigrated to [[Boston]] and passed for a [[Czechs|Czech]]-Austrian Hungarian [[Catholic]]</ref>   \n#\n# From 1870 to 1914, Poles and Polish subjects formed a significant part of the wave of immigration from [[Germany]], [[Imperial Russia]], and [[Austria Hungary]].  The Ethnic Poles and Jews in particular came in family groups, settled in and/or blended into largely Polish neighborhoods and other Slavic bastions, and aspired to earn relatively high wages compared to what they could earn back in Europe (thus why many took the ample job opportunities for unskilled manual labor in industry and mining).  The main Ethnically-Polish-American organizations were founded because of high Polish interest in the [[Catholic church]], [[parochial school]]s, and local community affairs. Relatively few were politically active. \n#\n# Since 1914, the United States has seen mass emigration from Poland, and the coming of age of several generations of fully assimilated Polish Americans. Immigration from Poland has continued into the early 2000s, and began to decline after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The income levels have gone up from well below average, to above average.

They did not plan to remain permanently and become \"Americanized\". Instead, they came temporarily to earn money, invest, and wait for the right opportunity to return. Their intention was to ensure a desirable social status in the old world for themselves. However, many of the temporary migrants decided to become permanent Americans.\n\nMany found manual labor jobs in the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] and the heavy industries (steel mills, iron foundries, slaughterhouses, oil and sugar refineries), of the Great Lakes cities of [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]].\n\n===U.S. Census===\n[[File:1922 Detroit store.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Polish-American grocery, 1922, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].]]\nThe U.S. Census asked Polish immigrants to specify Polish as their native language beginning in Chicago in 1900, allowing the government to enumerate them as an individual nationality when there was no Polish nation-state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flps.newberry.org/article/5423968_8_0624|title=About the Population Census|website=Flps.newberry.org|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> No distinction is made in the American census between [[ethnic Poles|ethnically Polish Americans]] and descendants of non-ethnic Poles, such as Jews or Ukrainians, who were born in the territory of Poland and considered themselves Polish nationals. Therefore, some say, of the 10 million Polish Americans, only a certain portion are of Polish ethnic descent.  On the other hand, many ethnic Poles when entering the US from 1795 to 1917, when Poland did not exist, did not identify themselves as ethnic Poles and instead identified themselves as either German, Austrian or Russian (this pertained to the nations occupying Poland from 1795 to 1917). Therefore, the actual number of Americans of at least partial Polish ancestry, could be well over 10 million. In the 2011 United States Census Bureau's Population Estimates, there are between 9,365,239 and 9,530,571 Americans of Polish descent, with over 500,000 being foreign-born.<ref name=\"American FactFinder\"/>\n\nHistorically, Polish-Americans have assimilated very quickly to American society. Between 1940 and 1960, only 20 percent of the children of Polish-American ethnic leaders spoke Polish regularly, compared to 50 percent for Ukrainians.<ref>Bukowczyck, p. 108</ref> In the early 1960s, 3,000 of Detroit's 300,000 Polish-Americans changed their names each year. Language proficiency in Polish is rare in Polish-Americans, as 91.3% speak \"English only\".<ref name=\"American FactFinder\"/> In 1979, the 8 million respondents of Polish ancestry reported that only 41.5 percent had single ancestry, whereas 57.3% of Greeks, 52% of Italians and Sicilians, and 44% of Ukrainians had done so. Polish-Americans tended to marry exogamously in the postwar era in high numbers, and tended to marry within the Catholic population, often to persons of German (17%), Italian (10%), East European (8%), Irish (5%), French-Canadian (4%), Spanish-speaking (2%), Lithuanian (2%), and English (1%) ancestry.<ref>Bukowczyck, p. 109</ref>\n\n===Income===\nBy educational attainment, the U.S. Census estimates that 42.5% have bachelor's degrees or higher, whereas the American population as a whole is 32.0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212194457/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2011 |title=American FactFinder - Search |author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS) |accessdate=29 December 2018 }}</ref> The median household income for Americans of Polish descent is estimated by the U.S. Census as $73,452, with no statistically significant differences from other Slavic-American groups, Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian.

Chicago's [[Taste of Polonia]] festival is celebrated at the [[Copernicus Foundation]], in [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]], every [[Labor Day]] weekend. Nearly 3 million people of Polish descent live in the area between Chicago and Detroit, including [[Northern Indiana]], a part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].  The community has played a role as a staunch supporter of the Democratic machine, and has been rewarded with several congressional seats.  The leading representative has been Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]], one of the most powerful members of Congress (1959 to 1995), especially on issues of taxation, before he went to prison.<ref>Tomasz Inglot, and John P.

St. Theresa's Roman Catholic Church offers Polish-language Mass. \n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, up to and immediately following the second  World War, Newark, New Jersey and Elizabeth, New Jersey were the primary, historic centers of 'Polonia' as Polish-Americans of that era thought of themselves. Castle Garden and Ellis Island generation immigrants and those that followed them found employment in the industries of these two cities as well as Linden which housed oil refineries and auto manufacturing. Initial settlements were in Newark, primariliy the \"Ironbound\" section, where St. Stanislaw Roman Catholic Church, followed by Casimir's Parish were the first parish churches founded and built by the communities there.  In Elizabeth, the first parish serving the Polish community is St. Adalbert's Roman Catholic Church.  All these parishes are over 100 years old, dating from the late 1800s, with churches constructed in the early 20th century. Post-war prosperity allowed many Polish Americans to disperse from the original core in New Jersey's industrial areas to the surrounding suburban communities. Documentation of their early history may be found on individual parkish websites.Other significant centers of Polish settlement in New Jersey included Garfield, New Jersey, Manville in Somerset County, Trenton, New Jersey, and Camden, New Jersey.\n\n====Other areas====\n\nIn [[Hudson County]], [[New Jersey]], [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] houses New Jersey's largest Polish American community, while [[Wallington, New Jersey|Wallington]] in [[Bergen County]], New Jersey contains the state's highest percentage of Polish Americans and one of the highest percentages in the United States, at over 40%. However, within New Jersey, Polish populations are additionally increasing rapidly in [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], [[Passaic County]] as well as in [[Garfield, New Jersey|Garfield]], Bergen County.\n\n[[Riverhead, New York]], located on eastern [[Long Island]], contains a neighborhood known as ''Polish Town'', where many Polish immigrants have continued to settle since the [[World War II]] era; the town has Polish [[architecture]], stores, and St. Isidore's R.C.

Historian John Radzilowski estimates that up to a third of Poles in Minnesota settled in rural areas, where they established 40 communities, that were often centered around a Catholic church.<ref>John Radzilowski. ''Poles in Minnesota.'' St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society, 2005. p.  6</ref> Most of these settlers came from the Polish lands that had been taken by Prussia during the Partitions, with a sub-group coming from Silesia. The Kaszub minority, from Poland's Baltic coast, was also strongly represented among Polish immigrants to Minnesota, most notably in Winona.  Despite relative isolation from Poland and larger urban Polonian communities, due to strong community integration these communities retained Polish language use into the 1970s in some cases and continue to have a strong Polish identity.\n\n===Michigan===\n{{see also|History of the Polish Americans in Metro Detroit}}\n[[Michigan]]'s Polish population of more than 850,000 is the third-largest among [[U.S. state|US states]], behind that of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]]. Polish Americans make up 8.6% of Michigan's total population. The city of [[Detroit]] has a very large Polish community, which historically settled in [[Poletown, Detroit|Poletown]] and [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] on the east side of Detroit, the neighborhoods along Michigan Avenue from 23rd street into east Dearborn, the west side of Delray, parts of Warrendale  and several sections of Wyandotte downriver. The northern part of Poletown was cleared of residents, to make way for the [[General Motors]] [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] plant. Today it contains some of the most opulent Polish churches in America like St. Stanislaus, Sweetest Heart of Mary, St. Albertus, St. Josephat and St. Hyacinthe. Michigan as a state has Polish populations throughout. In addition to [[metropolitan Detroit]], Grand Rapids, Bay City, Alpena and the surrounding area, the thumb of Michigan, Manistee, and numerous places in northern lower Michigan and south-central Michigan also have sizable Polish populations.\n\nThe Polish influence is still felt throughout the entire metropolitan Detroit area, especially the suburb of [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]], which is slowly emerging as the major center of Polish American activities in the state. An increase in new immigration from Poland is helping to bolster the parish community of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and a host of Polish American civic organizations, located within the city of Wyandotte. Also, the Detroit suburb of [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]] is home to the American Polish Cultural Center, where the [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] has over 200 artifacts on display from over 100 inductees, including [[Stan Musial]] and [[Mike Krzyzewski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishsportshof.com/ccpresense.html|title=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame Artifacts on Display at the American Polish Cultural Center|accessdate=2009-02-23|publisher=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[St. Mary's Preparatory]], a high school in [[Orchard Lake, Michigan|Orchard Lake]] with historically Polish roots, sponsors a popular annual Polish County Fair that bills itself as \"America's Largest High School Fair.\"\n\n===Ohio===\n[[File:Lagrange street Polish Festival items booth.JPG|thumbnail|Polish and Polish themed items booth at the Lagrange Street Polish Festival in [[Toledo, Ohio]].|300px]]\n[[Ohio]] is home to more than 440,000 people of Polish descent, their presence felt most strongly in the [[Greater Cleveland]] area, where half of Ohio's Polish population resides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP02&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212212624/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP02&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 February 2020|title=American FactFinder - Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|website=Factfinder2.census.gov|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] has a large Polish community, especially in historic [[Slavic Village]], as part of its Warszawa Section.

After seeing fellow Poles discriminated against by Cleveland's banks, Ben Stefanski formed Third Federal. Today the Stefanski family still controls the bank. Unlike Cleveland's [[KeyBank]] and [[National City Corp.]], which have their headquarters in [[Downtown Cleveland]], Third Federal is on Broadway Avenue in the [[Slavic Village]] neighborhood. Third Federal Savings and Loan is in the top 25 saving and loan institutions in the United States. In 2003, they acquired a [[Florida]] banking company and have branches in Florida and Ohio.\n\n=== Texas ===\n[[Panna Maria, Texas]] was founded by Upper Silesian settlers on Christmas Eve in 1854.

(See: [[Maps of American ancestries]]) This includes the cities of [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazelton]], and [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]]. Many of the immigrants were drawn to this area, because of the mining of [[Anthracite]] coal in the region. Polish influences are still common today, in the form of church bazaars, [[polka]] music, and [[Polish cuisine]]. It is widely believed that [[Boothwyn, Pennsylvania]], has one of the fastest growing Polish communities in the United States.\n\nIn 2007, at the urging of Attorney Adrian Baron and the local Polonia Business Association, New Britain, Connecticut officially designated its Broad Street neighborhood as ''Little Poland'', where an estimated 30,000 residents claim Polish heritage.

Replicas of the painting are common in Polish American churches and parishes, and many churches and parishes are named in her honor. The veneration of the Virgin Mary in Polish parishes is a significant difference between Polish Catholicism and Catholicism; Polish nuns in the [[Felician Sisters|Felician Order]] for instance, took to Marianism as the cornerstone of their spiritual development, and Polish churches in the U.S. were seen as \"cult-like\" in their veneration of Mary.<ref name=\"marythemessiah\">Mary the Messiah: Polish Immigrant Heresy and the Malleable Ideology of the Roman Catholic Church, 1880-1930. John J. Bukowczyk. Journal of American Ethnic History. Vol. 4, No. 2 (Spring, 1985), pp. 5-32</ref> Religious catechism and writings from convents found that Polish nuns in the Felician Sisters and The Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth were taught to have \"a sound appreciation of Mary's [[Co-Redemptrix|role in the mystery of the Redemption]] and ...a filial confidence in her patronage,\" more explicitly, to be \"a true daughter to the immaculate Virgin Mary\". The Marianism that was taught in Polish parish schools in the United States was done independent of the Catholic Church, and demonstrated autonomy on the part of the nuns who taught Polish American youths. It is notable that there was a concurrent movement in Poland that eventually led to a separatist Catholic church, the [[Mariavite Church]], which greatly expanded the veneration of the Virgin Mary in its doctrine. In Poland, the Virgin Mary was believed to serve as a mother of mercy and salvation for Catholics, and throughout the Middle Ages, Polish knights prayed to her before battle. Polish American churches featured replicas of the [[Black Madonna|Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa]], which was on feature at the [[Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery]] and holds national and religious significance because of its connection to a victorious military defense in 1655. Several towns in America are named [[Cz\u0119stochowa]], in commemoration of the town in Poland.<ref name=\"marythemessiah\"/>\n\nThough the majority of Polish Americans remained loyal to the Catholic Church, a [[Polish National Catholic Church|breakaway Catholic church]] was founded in 1897 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Polish parishioners founded the church to assert independence from the Catholic Church in America. The split was in rebellion from the church leadership, then dominated by Irish bishops and priests, and lacking in Polish language speakers and Polish church leaders. It exists today with 25,000 parishioners and remains independent from the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nPoland is also home to followers of [[Protestantism]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Small groups of both of these groups also immigrated to the United States. One of the most celebrated painters of religious icons in North America today is a Polish American Eastern Orthodox priest, Fr. [[Theodore Jurewicz]], who singlehandedly painted [[New Gra\u010danica Monastery]] in [[Third Lake, Illinois]], over the span of three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgracanica.com/monastery.htm|title=Serbian Monastery of New Gracanica \u2013 History|website=Newgracanica.com|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221012143/http://www.newgracanica.com/monastery.htm|archivedate=21 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nA small group of [[Lipka Tatars]], originating from the [[Bia\u0142ystok]] region, helped co-found the first [[Muslim]] organization in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1907 and later, a [[mosque]], which is still in use.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758343,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: Ramadan | date=1937-11-15 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Poland\u2013United States relations}}\n\n===Anti-Polonism===\n{{main|Antipolonism}}\nThe Polish community was long the subject of [[anti-Polish sentiment]] in America.

Roman Catholic churches built by Polish American communities often serve as a vehicle for cultural retention.\n\nDuring the 1950s\u20131970s, the Polish wedding was often an all-day event. Traditional Polish weddings in [[Chicago metropolitan area]], in areas such as the southeast side of Chicago, inner suburbs like Calumet City and Hegewisch, and [[Northwest Indiana]] suburbs, such as Whiting, Hammond and East Chicago, always occurred on Saturdays. The receptions were typically held in a large hall, such as a VFW Hall. A polka band of drums, a singer, accordion, and trumpet, entertained the people, as they danced traditional dances, such as the oberek, \"Polish Hop\" and the waltz. Always an important part of Slavic culture, food played a very important role. The musicians, as well as the guests, were expected to enjoy ample amounts of both food and drink. Foods, such as Polish sausage, sauerkraut, pierogi and kluski were common. Common drinks were beer, screwdrivers and highballs. Many popular Polish foods became a fixture in the American cuisine of today, including [[kielbasa|kie\u0142basa]] (Polish sausage), [[babka (food)|babka]] cake, [[kaszanka]] (kasanzka) and [[pierogi]].\n\nPolish American cultural groups include  [[Polish American Arts Association]] and the [[Polish Falcons]].\n\nAmong the many Polish American writers are a number of poets, such as [[Phil Boiarski]], [[Hedwig Gorski]], [[John Guzlowski]], [[John Minczeski]], [[Linda Nemec Foster]], [[Leonard Kress]] (poet and translator), [[Cecilia Woloch]], [[Kim Kikel]] and [[Mark Pawlak]] (poet and editor), along with novelists [[Leslie Pietrzyk]], [[Thad Rutkowski]], [[Suzanne Strempek Shea]]<ref name=\"PAHA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/resources.html|title=Polish American Historical Association - Resources and Supported Links|website=Polishamericanstudies.org|accessdate=28 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125204643/http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/resources.html|archive-date=2017-11-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> and others.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:20070822 Polish Museum.JPG|thumb|220px|left|The [[Polish Museum of America]] in [[Chicago]]. ]]\nAmong the best known Polish American museums are the [[Polish Museum of America]] in Chicago's old [[Polish Downtown]]; founded in 1935, the largest ethnic museum in the U.S. sponsored by the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]].

Distinctive cultural phenomena such as [[Polish flat]]s or the [[Polish Cathedral style]] of architecture became part and parcel of the areas where Polish settlement occurred.\n\nPoles' cultural ties to Roman Catholicism has also influenced the adoption of such distinctive rites like the blessing of the baskets before Easter in many areas of the United States by fellow Roman Catholics.\n\n===Architectural influence===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The John Gawlik House.jpg|thumb|left|High-pitched roofs were a common feature in Polish architecture.

''[[Songs About Jane]]'' consists of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane Herman.
