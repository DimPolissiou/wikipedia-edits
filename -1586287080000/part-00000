Tipler showed in his 1974 paper, \"Rotating Cylinders and the Possibility of Global Causality Violation\" that in a [[spacetime]] containing a massive, infinitely long [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] which was spinning along its longitudinal [[Coordinate axis|axis]], the cylinder should create a [[frame-dragging]] effect. This frame-dragging effect warps spacetime in such a way that the [[light cone]]s of objects in the cylinder's proximity become tilted, so that part of the light cone then points backwards along the time axis on a [[Minkowski diagram|space-time diagram]]. Therefore, a [[spacecraft]] accelerating sufficiently in the appropriate direction can travel backwards through time along a [[closed timelike curve]].<ref name=\"tipler paper\" />\n\nCTCs are associated, in [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|Lorentzian manifold]]s which are interpreted physically as spacetimes, with the possibility of causal anomalies such as a person going back in time and [[Grandfather paradox|potentially shooting his own grandfather]], although paradoxes might be avoided using some constraint such as the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].  They appear in some of the most important exact solutions in general relativity, including the [[Kerr metric|Kerr vacuum]] (which models a [[rotating black hole]]) and the [[van Stockum dust]] (which models a cylindrically symmetrical configuration of rotating pressureless fluid or [[dust solution|dust]]).\n\n==Practicality==\nAn objection to the practicality of building a Tipler cylinder was discovered by [[Stephen Hawking]], who provided a proof that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine in any finite region that satisfies the [[weak energy condition]], meaning that the region contains no [[exotic matter]] with negative energy. The Tipler cylinder, on the other hand, does not involve any negative energy. Tipler's original solution involved a cylinder of infinite length, which is easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough,<ref name=\"Earman2\">{{cite book | last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |date= 1995 | pages = 169 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}</ref> he did not prove this.

A later ruler, Imam [[Muhammed Jasa]], a kinsman of Ahmad Gragn, yielded to the pressures of increasing [[Oromo people|Oromo]] raids and in 1577 abandoned the city, relocating to [[Asaita|Aussa]] and making his brother ruler of Harar. The new base not only failed to provide more security from the Oromos, it attracted the hostile attention of the neighboring [[Afar people|Afars]] who raided caravans traveling between Harar and the coast. The [[Imamate of Aussa|Imams of Aussa]] declined over the next century while Harar regained its independence under [[`Ali ibn Da`ud]], the founder of a dynasty that ruled the city from 1647 until 1875, when it was conquered by [[Egypt]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 375-377</ref>\n\nHarar was very dependent on [[Berbera]] for trade since the Middle Ages. According to [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]], who visited both Berbera and Harar during his travels, he repeated a famous Harari saying he heard in 1854: \"He who commands at Berbera, holds the beard of Harar in his hands.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jonas|first1=Raymond|title= The Battle of Adwa|date=2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=74|language=english}}</ref> A significant portion of the trade between the two historic towns was controlled by merchants belonging to the [[Habar Awal]] Somali clan, who also partook in the trade of the renowned Harari coffee beans which was named ''Berbera Coffee'' in the international market.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref>  \n\nDuring the period of Egyptian rule (1875-1884), [[Arthur Rimbaud]] lived in the city as the local functionary of several different commercial companies based in [[Aden]]; he returned in 1888 to resume trading in coffee, musk, and skins until a fatal disease forced him to return to France. A house said to have been his residence is now a museum.<ref>Munro-Hay, ''Ethiopia, the unknown land: a cultural and historical guide'' (London: I.B.

As a result of this, [[Dire Dawa]] was founded in 1902 as ''New Harar''. The British planned to revitalise the historic Berbera - Harar trade route by connecting the two cities via rail as a means to counter French influence in the region; however, the major infrastructure project was later abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1915675|title=Berbera-Harrar Railway Survey Vol. 1|first=}}</ref> \n[[File:Harari Traditions (2202473839).jpg|thumb|left|A traditional home in Harar with a niche adorned with Islamic calligraphy.]]\nHarar was captured by Italian troops under Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] on 8 May 1937.

A later ruler, Imam [[Muhammed Jasa]], a kinsman of Ahmad Gragn, yielded to the pressures of increasing [[Oromo people|Oromo]] raids and in 1577 abandoned the city, relocating to [[Asaita|Aussa]] and making his brother ruler of Harar. The new base not only failed to provide more security from the Oromos, it attracted the hostile attention of the neighboring [[Afar people|Afars]] who raided caravans traveling between Harar and the coast. The [[Imamate of Aussa|Imams of Aussa]] declined over the next century while Harar regained its independence under [[`Ali ibn Da`ud]], the founder of a dynasty that ruled the city from 1647 until 1875, when it was conquered by [[Egypt]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 375-377</ref>\n\nHarar was very dependent on [[Berbera]] for trade since the Middle Ages.

As a result of this, [[Dire Dawa]] was founded in 1902 as ''New Harar''. The British planned to revitalise the historic Berbera - Harar trade route by connecting the two cities via rail as a means to counter French influence in the region; however, the major infrastructure project was later abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1915675|title=Berbera-Harrar Railway Survey Vol. 1|first=}}</ref> \n[[File:Harari Traditions (2202473839).jpg|thumb|left|A traditional home in Harar with a niche adorned with Islamic calligraphy.]]\nHarar was captured by Italian troops under Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] on 8 May 1937.

It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n[[File:Frank Ocean Coachella 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ocean performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in August 2012.]]\n''Channel Orange'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\"/> The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\">{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 18, 2012|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/481282/zac-brown-band-frank-ocean-debut-at-nos-1-2-on-billboard-200|title=Zac Brown Band, Frank Ocean Debut at Nos. 1 & 2 on Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|accessdate=July 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfD79dDQ?url=http://m.billboard.com/v/News/ZacBrownBandFrank/?p=0&KSID=ad102a113cf37fe3c8620e8cc7ba2906&ints_viewed=1|archivedate=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  On January 30, ''Channel Orange'' was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

It also earned Ocean six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, ''Channel Orange'' featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Funk and electric music also influenced his album. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when [[David Bowie]] revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2012 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |title=Frank Ocean records another first as Channel Orange is named album of the year |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214144802/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/frank-ocean-records-another-first-as-channel-orange-is-named-album-of-the-year-8421123.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n[[File:Frank Ocean Coachella 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ocean performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in August 2012.]]\n''Channel Orange'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\"/> The majority of its first-week sales were digital copies from iTunes, while approximately 3,000 of the sales were physical copies.<ref name=\"Caulfield2\">{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 18, 2012|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/481282/zac-brown-band-frank-ocean-debut-at-nos-1-2-on-billboard-200|title=Zac Brown Band, Frank Ocean Debut at Nos. 1 & 2 on Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|accessdate=July 18, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfD79dDQ?url=http://m.billboard.com/v/News/ZacBrownBandFrank/?p=0&KSID=ad102a113cf37fe3c8620e8cc7ba2906&ints_viewed=1|archivedate=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  On January 30, ''Channel Orange'' was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

When the game proves to be wildly successful, they form a gaming company called ''Game Shakers'', and hire their friend, Hudson. They later partner with rapper Double G, who becomes their investor as part of a compromise for their illegal use of his song, \"Drop Dat What\", in their game. Double G's son, Triple G, then becomes a video game consultant for the company, making him the fourth Game Shaker.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Game Shakers episodes}}\n{{:List of Game Shakers episodes}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* Cree Cicchino as Babe Carano,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danschneider.com/shows/game-shakers/cast-and-characters/babe-carano|title=Babe Carano|work=[[DanWarp]]|author=[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]|access-date=August 1, 2017}}</ref> creator of ''Game Shakers'' at 12-years-old.
