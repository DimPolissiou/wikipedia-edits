Spock also had the ability to project a unique form of energy through his fingertips. Nimoy explained the idea of putting his hand on his neck and shoulder to Shatner, and they rehearsed it.

The [[Star Trek (film series)|first six Star Trek movies]] feature the original ''Star Trek'' cast including Nimoy, who also directed two of the films. He played the elder Spock in the 2009 [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' movie]] and reprised the role in a brief appearance in the 2013 sequel, ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', both directed by [[J.

During the run of the play, Nimoy took over as its director and wanted his character to be \"rough and tough,\" and insisted on having tattoos.

In the 1970s, he studied photography at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"rawnerve\" /><ref>[http://petapixel.com/2015/02/27/leonard-nimoys-passion-for-photography/ Leonard Nimoy's Passion for Photography], PetaPixel, February 27, 2015</ref> His photography studies at UCLA occurred after ''Star Trek'' and ''Mission: Impossible'', when Nimoy seriously considered changing careers. His work has been exhibited at the R. Michelson Galleries in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"rawnerve\" /> and the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\n===Directing===\nNimoy made his directorial debut in 1973, with the \"Death on a Barge\" segment for an episode of ''[[Night Gallery]]'' during its final season. It was not until the early 1980s that Nimoy resumed directing on a consistent basis, ranging from television shows to motion pictures. Nimoy directed ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' in 1984 and ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' in 1986. He went on to direct the hit comedy ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987), followed by ''[[The Good Mother (1988 film)|The Good Mother]]'' (1988) and ''[[Funny About Love]]'' (1990). In 1994 he directed his last feature film, ''[[Holy Matrimony (1994 film)|Holy Matrimony]]''. His final directorial credit was \"Killshot\", the 1995 pilot episode for ''[[Deadly Games]]'', a short-lived science-fiction television series.\n\n===Writing===\nNimoy authored two volumes of autobiography. The first was called ''[[I Am Not Spock]]'' (1975) and was controversial, as many fans incorrectly assumed Nimoy was distancing himself from the Spock character. In the book, Nimoy conducts dialogues between himself and Spock. The contents of this first autobiography also touched on a self-proclaimed \"[[identity crisis]]\" that seemed to haunt Nimoy throughout his career. It also related to an apparent love/hate relationship with the character of Spock and the Trek franchise.\n\n{{quote|I went through a definite identity crisis. The question was whether to embrace Mr. Spock or to fight the onslaught of public interest. I realize now that I really had no choice in the matter. Spock and ''Star Trek'' were very much alive and there wasn't anything that I could do to change that.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://startrekdom.blogspot.com/2007/05/leonard-nimoys-lovehate-relationship.html |title=Leonard Nimoy's Love/Hate Relationship with Mr. Spock |last=B. |first=Jared |date=May 24, 2007 |website=Trekdom \u2013 Star Trek Fanzine |type=Blog |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe second volume, ''[[I Am Spock]]'' (1995), saw Nimoy communicating that he finally realized his years of portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in a way he never would have, had he not portrayed the character. Nimoy maintained that in some meaningful sense he had merged with Spock while at the same time maintaining the distance between fact and fiction. In 2014, the audiobook version of ''I Am Spock'', read by Nimoy, was published.<ref>Brilliance Audio, {{ISBN|978-1491575727}}</ref>\n\nNimoy also composed several volumes of poetry, some published along with a number of his photographs. A later poetic volume entitled ''A Lifetime of Love: Poems on the Passages of Life'' was published in 2002. His poetry can be found in the Contemporary Poets index of The HyperTexts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehypertexts.com |title=The HyperTexts |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> Nimoy adapted and starred in the one-man play ''Vincent'' (1981), based on the play ''Van Gogh'' (1979) by Phillip Stephens.\n\nIn 1995, Nimoy was involved in the production of ''[[Primortals]]'', a comic book series published by [[Tekno Comix]] about [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with aliens, which had arisen from a discussion he had with [[Isaac Asimov]]. There was a novelization by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]].\n\n===Music===\nDuring and following ''Star Trek'', Nimoy also released [[Leonard Nimoy discography|five albums of musical vocal recordings on Dot Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |title=Two Sides Of Leonard Nimoy |website=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021320/http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On his first album, ''[[Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space|Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space]]'', and half of his second album ''[[Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy]]'', science fiction-themed songs are featured where Nimoy sings as Spock. On his final three albums, he sings popular folk songs of the era and cover versions of popular songs, such as \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[I Walk the Line]]\". There are also several songs on the later albums that were written or co-written by Nimoy. He described how his recording career got started:\n\n:[[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]] of [[Dot Records]] had arranged with the studio to do an album of space music based on music from ''Star Trek'', and he has a teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from ''Star Trek'', then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both.{{nbsp}}... That was the first album we did, which was called ''Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space''. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |title=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021529/http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!--hide uncited material\nThe albums were popular and resulted in numerous live appearances and promotional record signings that attracted crowds of fans in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The early recordings were produced by [[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]], who may be best known for his version of \"Quentin's Theme\" from the mid-sixties [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''.

He was known for playing [[Spock]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, a character he portrayed in television and film for almost fifty years, from [[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|a pilot episode]] shot in late 1964 to his [[Star Trek Into Darkness|final film performance]] in 2013.<ref name=\"NYT-20150227\" />\n\nNimoy began his career in his early twenties, teaching acting classes in [[Hollywood]] and making minor film and television appearances through the 1950s, as well as playing the title role in ''[[Kid Monk Baroni]]''. Foreshadowing his fame as a semi-alien, he played Narab, one of three Martian invaders, in the 1952 [[Serial film|movie serial]] ''[[Zombies of the Stratosphere]]''. From 1959 to 1962 he appeared in four episodes of ''[[Wagon Train]]''.\n\nIn December 1964, he made his first appearance in the rejected ''Star Trek'' television pilot \"[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]\", and went on to play the character of Spock until the end of the production run in early 1969, followed by eight feature films and guest appearances in the various spin-off series. The character has had a significant cultural impact and earned Nimoy three [[Emmy Award]] nominations. ''[[TV Guide]]'' named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/leonard-nimoy/bio/161833 |title=Leonard Nimoy: Biography |website=TVGuide.com |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |location=San Francisco, California |accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/best-tv-characters-of-all-time/?cur=spock&morepics=1 |title=Spock |last=Jensen |first=K.

His work has been exhibited at the R. Michelson Galleries in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"rawnerve\" /> and the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]].\n\n===Directing===\nNimoy made his directorial debut in 1973, with the \"Death on a Barge\" segment for an episode of ''[[Night Gallery]]'' during its final season. It was not until the early 1980s that Nimoy resumed directing on a consistent basis, ranging from television shows to motion pictures. Nimoy directed ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' in 1984 and ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' in 1986. He went on to direct the hit comedy ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987), followed by ''[[The Good Mother (1988 film)|The Good Mother]]'' (1988) and ''[[Funny About Love]]'' (1990). In 1994 he directed his last feature film, ''[[Holy Matrimony (1994 film)|Holy Matrimony]]''. His final directorial credit was \"Killshot\", the 1995 pilot episode for ''[[Deadly Games]]'', a short-lived science-fiction television series.\n\n===Writing===\nNimoy authored two volumes of autobiography. The first was called ''[[I Am Not Spock]]'' (1975) and was controversial, as many fans incorrectly assumed Nimoy was distancing himself from the Spock character. In the book, Nimoy conducts dialogues between himself and Spock. The contents of this first autobiography also touched on a self-proclaimed \"[[identity crisis]]\" that seemed to haunt Nimoy throughout his career. It also related to an apparent love/hate relationship with the character of Spock and the Trek franchise.\n\n{{quote|I went through a definite identity crisis. The question was whether to embrace Mr. Spock or to fight the onslaught of public interest. I realize now that I really had no choice in the matter.

Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in a way he never would have, had he not portrayed the character. Nimoy maintained that in some meaningful sense he had merged with Spock while at the same time maintaining the distance between fact and fiction. In 2014, the audiobook version of ''I Am Spock'', read by Nimoy, was published.<ref>Brilliance Audio, {{ISBN|978-1491575727}}</ref>\n\nNimoy also composed several volumes of poetry, some published along with a number of his photographs. A later poetic volume entitled ''A Lifetime of Love: Poems on the Passages of Life'' was published in 2002. His poetry can be found in the Contemporary Poets index of The HyperTexts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehypertexts.com |title=The HyperTexts |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> Nimoy adapted and starred in the one-man play ''Vincent'' (1981), based on the play ''Van Gogh'' (1979) by Phillip Stephens.\n\nIn 1995, Nimoy was involved in the production of ''[[Primortals]]'', a comic book series published by [[Tekno Comix]] about [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with aliens, which had arisen from a discussion he had with [[Isaac Asimov]]. There was a novelization by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]].\n\n===Music===\nDuring and following ''Star Trek'', Nimoy also released [[Leonard Nimoy discography|five albums of musical vocal recordings on Dot Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |title=Two Sides Of Leonard Nimoy |website=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021320/http://www.maidenwine.com/lps_02.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On his first album, ''[[Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space|Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space]]'', and half of his second album ''[[Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy]]'', science fiction-themed songs are featured where Nimoy sings as Spock. On his final three albums, he sings popular folk songs of the era and cover versions of popular songs, such as \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[I Walk the Line]]\". There are also several songs on the later albums that were written or co-written by Nimoy. He described how his recording career got started:\n\n:[[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]] of [[Dot Records]] had arranged with the studio to do an album of space music based on music from ''Star Trek'', and he has a teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from ''Star Trek'', then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both.{{nbsp}}... That was the first album we did, which was called ''Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space''. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |title=The Musical Touch of Leonard Nimoy |publisher=Maidenwine.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021529/http://www.maidenwine.com/home.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!--hide uncited material\nThe albums were popular and resulted in numerous live appearances and promotional record signings that attracted crowds of fans in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The early recordings were produced by [[Charles Randolph Grean|Charles Grean]], who may be best known for his version of \"Quentin's Theme\" from the mid-sixties [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''.

Random House, Penguin Books. pages 154-168. {{ISBN|9781101980965}}</ref> MacLean's account, however, has come under scrutiny. Economist Andrew Farrant examined the Chilean constitutional clauses that MacLean attributes to Buchanan, and discovered that they pre-dated his visit. He concludes that \"evidence suggests that Buchanan's May 1980 visit did not particularly influence the subsequent drafting of the Chilean Constitution\" and \"there is no evidence to suggest that Buchanan had any kind of audience with Pinochet or corresponded with the Chilean dictator.\"<ref>Farrant, Andrew. \"What Should (Knightian) Economists Do?

Confronted with increasing opposition, notably at the international level, Pinochet legalized political parties in 1987 and called for a vote to determine whether or not he would remain in power until 1997. If the \"YES\" won, Pinochet would have to implement the dispositions of the 1980 Constitution, mainly the call for general elections, while he would himself remain in power as President. If the \"NO\" won, Pinochet would remain President for another year, and a joint Presidential and legislative election would be held.\n\nAnother reason for Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile. According to the US Catholic author [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed a return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of his government, and even called for his resignation.<ref>[[George Weigel]], ''Biograf\u00eda de Juan Pablo II \u2013 Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza & Jan\u00e9s (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinochet Aylwin Bush.png|thumb|Former President Pinochet as Commander-in-Chief and President Aylwin met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990.]]\nPolitical advertising was legalized on 5 September 1987, as a necessary element for the campaign for the \"NO\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign, which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. The Opposition, gathered into the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por el NO]]'' (\"Coalition of Parties for NO\"), organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan ''La alegr\u00eda ya viene'' (\"Joy is coming\"). It was formed by the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democracy]], the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]], gathered in the ''Alianza Democr\u00e1tica'' (Democratic Alliance). In 1988, several more parties, including the [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]], the [[Ecologist Party of Chile|Ecologist Party]], the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support.\n\nOn 5 October 1988, the \"NO\" option won with 55.99%<ref name=\"Elections\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117085107/http://www.tribunalcalificador.cl/resultado.php Tribunal Calificador], Chilean governmental website {{in lang|es}}</ref> of the votes, against 44.01% of \"YES\" votes. Pinochet accepted the result and the ensuing Constitutional process led to presidential and legislative elections the following year.\n\nThe Coalition changed its name to ''Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por la Democracia'' (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward [[Patricio Aylwin]], a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also proposed a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a [[1989 Chilean referendum|referendum]] on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing [[Southern Party]] and the Chilean Socialist Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0041490 |title=El plebiscito incomprendido |work=[[Apsi]] |date=17 July 1989}}</ref> The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.\n\nThereafter, Aylwin won the [[1989 Chilean presidential election|December 1989 presidential election]] with 55% of the votes,<ref name=Elections/> against less than 30% for the right-wing candidate, [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]], who had been Pinochet's [[Minister of Finances]] since 1985 (there was also a third-party candidate, [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera|Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz]], a wealthy aristocrat representing the extreme economic right, who garnered the remaining 15%<ref name=Elections/>). Pinochet thus left the presidency on 11 March 1990 and transferred power to the new democratically elected president.\n\nThe ''Concertaci\u00f3n'' also won the majority of votes for the Parliament. However, due to the \"binomial\" representation system included in the constitution, the elected senators did not achieve a complete majority in Parliament, a situation that would last for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the [[Alliance for Chile]] (originally called \"Democracy and Progress\" and then \"Union for Chile\"), a center-right coalition involving the ''[[Independent Democratic Union|Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]]'' (UDI) and ''[[National Renewal (Chile)|Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (RN), parties composed mainly of Pinochet's supporters.\n\nDue to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a [[senator-for-life]], a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] protected him from legal action. These were possible in Chile only after Pinochet was arrested in 1998 in the [[United Kingdom]], on an [[extradition]] request issued by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]. Allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon.<ref>See [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n Tapia]]'s autobiography</ref> The extradition attempt was dramatised in the 2006 BBC television docudrama ''[[Pinochet in Suburbia]]'', with Pinochet played by [[Derek Jacobi]].

Guzm\u00e1n had ordered in 1999 the arrest of five militarists, including General [[Pedro Espinoza Bravo]] of the [[Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], for their role in the [[Caravan of Death]] following the coup on 11 September. Arguing that the bodies of the \"[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]\" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]], which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on 10 December 2006, with an alternation of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed, in March 2005, Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were \"disappeared\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial funding of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only \"a former public official\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caribbean islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing French '[[Dassault Mirage|Mirage]]' fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch '[[Leopard 2]]' tanks, Swiss '[[MOWAG]]' armored vehicles or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans war]].) His wife, [[Luc\u00eda Hiriart]], and his son, Marco Antonio Pinochet, were also sued for complicity. For the fourth time in seven years, Pinochet was indicted by the Chilean justice.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/28/chile.pinochet/?section=cnn_topstories U.S. sends back Pinochet daughter], ''[[CNN]]'', 28 January 2006</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Pinochet muerto.jpg|thumb|upright|Pinochet on the bier on 11 December 2006]]\n[[File:Feretro Pinochet.jpg|thumb|Pinochet's funeral]]\nPinochet suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the morning of 3 December 2006 and was given the [[last rites]] the same day.

In 1935, after four years studying [[military geography]] he graduated with the rank of ''alf\u00e9rez'' ([[Second lieutenant|Second Lieutenant]]) in the [[infantry]]. \n\n==Military career==\nIn September 1937, Pinochet was assigned to the \"Chacabuco\" Regiment, in [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]]. Two years later, in 1939, then with the rank of Sub-lieutenant, he moved to the \"Maipo\" Regiment, garrisoned in Valpara\u00edso. He returned to Infantry School in 1940. On 30 January 1943, Pinochet married [[Luc\u00eda Hiriart|Luc\u00eda Hiriart Rodr\u00edguez]], with whom he had five children: [[Luc\u00eda Pinochet|In\u00e9s Luc\u00eda]], Mar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica, Jacqueline Marie, Augusto Osvaldo and Marco Antonio.\n\nBy late 1945, Pinochet had been assigned to the \"Carampangue\" Regiment in the northern city of [[Iquique]]. Three years later, he entered the Chilean War Academy but had to postpone his studies because, being the youngest officer, he had to carry out a service mission in the [[coal]] zone of [[Lota, Chile|Lota]]. The following year he returned to his studies in the Academy, and after obtaining the title of Officer Chief of Staff, in 1951, he returned to teach at the Military School.

He was also the editor of the institutional magazine ''Cien \u00c1guilas'' (\"One Hundred Eagles\").

At the end of 1959 he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the 1st Army Division, based in [[Antofagasta]]. The following year, he was appointed commander of the \"Esmeralda\" Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963. In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army Division, based in [[Santiago]], and at the end of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and Commander in Chief of the 6th Division, garrisoned in Iquique.

Economist Andrew Farrant examined the Chilean constitutional clauses that MacLean attributes to Buchanan, and discovered that they pre-dated his visit. He concludes that \"evidence suggests that Buchanan's May 1980 visit did not particularly influence the subsequent drafting of the Chilean Constitution\" and \"there is no evidence to suggest that Buchanan had any kind of audience with Pinochet or corresponded with the Chilean dictator.\"<ref>Farrant, Andrew. \"What Should (Knightian) Economists Do?

Confronted with increasing opposition, notably at the international level, Pinochet legalized political parties in 1987 and called for a vote to determine whether or not he would remain in power until 1997. If the \"YES\" won, Pinochet would have to implement the dispositions of the 1980 Constitution, mainly the call for general elections, while he would himself remain in power as President. If the \"NO\" won, Pinochet would remain President for another year, and a joint Presidential and legislative election would be held.\n\nAnother reason for Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile. According to the US Catholic author [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed a return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of his government, and even called for his resignation.<ref>[[George Weigel]], ''Biograf\u00eda de Juan Pablo II \u2013 Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza & Jan\u00e9s (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinochet Aylwin Bush.png|thumb|Former President Pinochet as Commander-in-Chief and President Aylwin met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990.]]\nPolitical advertising was legalized on 5 September 1987, as a necessary element for the campaign for the \"NO\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign, which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. The Opposition, gathered into the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por el NO]]'' (\"Coalition of Parties for NO\"), organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan ''La alegr\u00eda ya viene'' (\"Joy is coming\"). It was formed by the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democracy]], the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]], gathered in the ''Alianza Democr\u00e1tica'' (Democratic Alliance). In 1988, several more parties, including the [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]], the [[Ecologist Party of Chile|Ecologist Party]], the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support.\n\nOn 5 October 1988, the \"NO\" option won with 55.99%<ref name=\"Elections\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117085107/http://www.tribunalcalificador.cl/resultado.php Tribunal Calificador], Chilean governmental website {{in lang|es}}</ref> of the votes, against 44.01% of \"YES\" votes. Pinochet accepted the result and the ensuing Constitutional process led to presidential and legislative elections the following year.\n\nThe Coalition changed its name to ''Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por la Democracia'' (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward [[Patricio Aylwin]], a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also proposed a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a [[1989 Chilean referendum|referendum]] on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing [[Southern Party]] and the Chilean Socialist Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0041490 |title=El plebiscito incomprendido |work=[[Apsi]] |date=17 July 1989}}</ref> The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.\n\nThereafter, Aylwin won the [[1989 Chilean presidential election|December 1989 presidential election]] with 55% of the votes,<ref name=Elections/> against less than 30% for the right-wing candidate, [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]], who had been Pinochet's [[Minister of Finances]] since 1985 (there was also a third-party candidate, [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera|Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz]], a wealthy aristocrat representing the extreme economic right, who garnered the remaining 15%<ref name=Elections/>). Pinochet thus left the presidency on 11 March 1990 and transferred power to the new democratically elected president.\n\nThe ''Concertaci\u00f3n'' also won the majority of votes for the Parliament. However, due to the \"binomial\" representation system included in the constitution, the elected senators did not achieve a complete majority in Parliament, a situation that would last for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the [[Alliance for Chile]] (originally called \"Democracy and Progress\" and then \"Union for Chile\"), a center-right coalition involving the ''[[Independent Democratic Union|Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]]'' (UDI) and ''[[National Renewal (Chile)|Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (RN), parties composed mainly of Pinochet's supporters.\n\nDue to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a [[senator-for-life]], a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] protected him from legal action.

Arguing that the bodies of the \"[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]\" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]], which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on 10 December 2006, with an alternation of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed, in March 2005, Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were \"disappeared\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial funding of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only \"a former public official\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caribbean islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing French '[[Dassault Mirage|Mirage]]' fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch '[[Leopard 2]]' tanks, Swiss '[[MOWAG]]' armored vehicles or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans war]].)
