It is the sixteenth episode of [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|season five]] and the 62nd overall episode of the series. Written and directed by series creator [[Vince Gilligan]], it aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on September 29, 2013. It was followed by a [[sequel]] film, ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', which was made available on [[Netflix]] on October 11, 2019.\n\nThe plot involves [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] evading a nationwide manhunt for him in order to return to [[New Mexico]] and deliver the remaining profits from his illegal [[methamphetamine]] empire to his family. He also takes revenge on the Aryan Brotherhood gang who double-crossed him, killed his brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader|Hank]], took [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] captive and presented a threat to his family. Knowing the cancer will soon kill him, Walt revisits his former acquaintances to settle his affairs and prepare himself for the conflict and his death.\n\nUpon airing, \"Felina\" was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Several critics have called it one of the greatest series finales of all time.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter leaving the bar,{{Efn|As depicted in \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\".|name=|group=}} [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] departs [[New Hampshire]] in a stolen car. He returns to [[New Mexico]] and tracks down [[Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz]] at their new house in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. With help from [[Badger Mayhew]] and [[Skinny Pete]] using [[laser pointer]]s to spoof weapon [[laser sight]]s aimed on the couple, Walter coerces the Schwartzs to take his remaining $9.72&nbsp;million and establish a trust fund in their name to [[Walter White Jr.|Walt Jr.]], and as to \"make things right\" for minimizing Walt's involvement in Gray Matter. After paying Badger and Pete, he learns [[Jack Welker]]'s gang is distributing blue meth, and thus [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] is likely still alive as their \"cook\".\n\nOn his 52nd birthday, Walt purchases an [[M60 machine gun]]{{efn|Originally shown as a flashforward in \"[[Live Free or Die (Breaking Bad)|Live Free or Die]]\".}} and retrieves the [[ricin]] from his abandoned house.{{efn|Originally shown as a flashforward in \"[[Blood Money (Breaking Bad)|Blood Money]].\"}} He connects the machine gun to a pivoting turret inside the trunk of the car he is now driving, which is rigged to a remote [[Remote keyless system|unlock button]]. He interrupts [[Todd Alquist|Todd]] and [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle|Lydia]]'s regular meeting at a coffee shop and makes a business proposal, offering what he claims is a new formula for [[methylamine]]-free meth. Todd turns him down, but Lydia feigns interest to lure Walt into meeting with Jack, knowing he will kill Walt. Later, [[Skyler White|Skyler]] receives a phone call from [[Marie Schrader|Marie]], who warns her that Walt has been seen in Albuquerque. Walt, who is already with Skyler, leaves her the lottery ticket on which he had encoded the location of the money.{{efn|As depicted in \"[[Buried (Breaking Bad)|Buried]]\".}} Following the shootout in the desert, the coordinates now reveal [[Hank Schrader|Hank]] and [[Steven Gomez|Steve]]'s hidden grave, and Walt advises Skyler to use the location as leverage in negotiating a favorable plea bargain. Walt admits to Skyler that contrary to his previous claims that he only wanted to make money to support his family after his death, his life as a drug kingpin was for himself. Skyler allows Walt to see Holly while she sleeps. After leaving, Walt watches from afar as Walt Jr. arrives home from school.\n\nWalt drives to Jack's hideout and parks alongside the building. He meets inside with Jack and his men, but Jack refuses Walt's meth formula offer and orders him killed. Walt diverts Jack's attention by accusing him of going back on his promise to kill Jesse and instead partnering with him to continue the meth business. Jack responds by ordering that Jesse be brought from the [[Quonset hut]] where he is cooking meth so Jack can prove Jesse is a captive, not a partner. Upon seeing Jesse, Walt tackles him out of the line of fire and uses the remote unlock button to fire the machine gun through the building's walls; everyone but Jack, Todd, Jesse, and Walt are killed. Jesse strangles and kills Todd with the chain attached to his handcuffs, and then frees himself with Todd's keys. A wounded Jack attempts to bargain for his life with the location of the money he stole from Walt, but Walt kills him mid-sentence. Walt gives the gun to Jesse and asks Jesse to kill him. Jesse notices Walt is wounded from the machine gun's fire and refuses, telling Walt that if he wants to die he should do it himself.\n\nAs Jesse and Walt leave Jack's house, Walt answers Todd's phone and speaks with an obviously ill Lydia. He informs her that Jack and his gang are all dead and that she'll soon be dead too because he planted ricin in her [[stevia]] during the meeting at the coffee shop. Jesse and Walt exchange a farewell glance before Jesse flees in Todd's [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].{{efn|Events related to Jesse's escape were presented in the following film, ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]''.}} Walt enters the lab and smiles nostalgically as he admires the equipment, before he falls to the floor, collapsing from his wound. Police rush in with guns drawn as he lies motionless, a slight smile of satisfaction on his face, and dies soon after.<ref name=\"cos\" />\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Vince Gilligan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|alt=Gilligan at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con International|thumb|Series creator [[Vince Gilligan]] wrote and directed \"Felina\"]]\n\nProduction on \"Felina\" and the ''Breaking Bad'' series concluded on April 2, 2013, according to Cranston.<ref name=\"prod\" />\n\nOn September 18, 2013, it was announced that both \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\" and \"Felina\" would run 75 minutes, including commercials.<ref name=\"hr\" /> The actual runtime of the episodes is 55 minutes. The episode was written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan.\n\n=== Title reference and music ===\nThe episode title, \"Felina\", is inspired by the character Feleena from the song \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\" by [[Marty Robbins]], which plays a major role during the episode.<ref name=\"avclub\" />\n\nThe story of \"El Paso\" closely mirrors Walter White's character arc in the final season of Breaking Bad. Walt, who has become a notorious criminal, flees from Albuquerque, living as a fugitive. Despite this being a successful outcome in the context of the story, he finds himself increasingly isolated and dissatisfied. Because his desire for emotional closure outweighs his fear of capture and death, he is eventually driven to return to the scene of his crimes, where he finds the closure he seeks but ultimately meets his end. \"El Paso\" is on a Marty Robbins cassette in Walt's car, and is played during the episode. The writers changed the subject's name from ''Feleena'' to ''Felina'' so that, when used as the title, it could serve as an anagram of ''Finale''.<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref name=\"amc\" />\n\nThere are also a number of fan theories regarding the significance of the music: the word Felina can be broken up into three different symbols of chemical elements found in the [[periodic table]]: [[iron]] (Fe), [[lithium]] (Li), and [[sodium]] (Na). The title was interpreted by some as [[blood, sweat and tears|\"blood, meth and tears\"]] because iron is a predominant element in blood, lithium is sometimes used in methamphetamine production, and sodium is a component of tears.<ref name=\"ds\" /> According to Eric Brown of ''[[International Business Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\"In its pure form&nbsp;... methamphetamine is composed solely of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N), no lithium involved. However, there are multiple ways to synthesize meth from other ingredients, and several involve lithium. The [[Birch reduction]], also called the \"Nazi method,\" mixes lithium and ammonia to create a reaction. Another, called the \"Shake 'n' Bake\" method, involved throwing lithium and several other ingredients into a single pot to create the drug. Both methods are extremely dangerous, as lithium is a highly volatile element. Unfortunately, there's a big hole in this theory: Walt never uses a lithium-based synthesis in the show.&nbsp;... Walt uses two methods throughout the show: first the Nagai method involving red phosphorus and later a methylamine P2P reaction resulting in the famous blue meth. Neither one uses lithium at any point, shooting a big hole in this theory.\"<ref name=\"ds\" /><ref name=\"decoding\" /><ref name=\"time\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[Badfinger]]'s \"[[Baby Blue (Badfinger song)|Baby Blue]]\" is played during the final scene. According to series creator Vince Gilligan, this is reference to the high-quality blue meth Walt had produced over the previous seasons and his life as a drug kingpin which the main character at last recognizes he had enjoyed.<ref name=\"rs\" /> According to ''Rolling Stone'', the music supervisors on the show disagreed with Gilligan's choice for the final song;<ref name=\"rs\" /> however, music supervisor Thomas Golubi\u0107 stated that \"journalists sometimes try to create drama where there isn't any\" and that his quotes were \"mis-represented\".<ref name=\"ama\" /> \"Baby Blue\" became an obvious choice as the editing came closer to completion with Golubi\u0107 describing the process of finalizing the song:\n\n{{quote|Before I saw the scene, I pulled together a number of ideas&nbsp;\u2013 one which I thought worked pretty beautifully against picture: [[The Bees (band)|The Bees]]' \"No More Excuses\"&nbsp;\u2013 but once I saw that beautiful shot, and saw the scene in context, I realized why Vince was so strongly attached to the Badfinger song. It's tricky for us as music supervisors in that we keep pulling together ideas and revising them. None of us know the right answer until we are at the very end of that process and have cut and locked picture to work with. Vince is just really talented at knowing what the final effect he is looking for, and knew early on that Badfinger's \"Baby Blue\" was the right choice for what he was looking to do. It took until the final picture was assembled that I was able to also see what a fantastic choice it was.<ref name=\"ama\" />|source=}}\n\n=== ''El Camino'' ===\nAfter the conclusion of the series, Gilligan had considered Jesse's fate, stating that rather than getting caught by police, he had envisioned that Jesse would end up in Alaska to start his life anew.<ref name=\"ew\" /> He had mulled this idea over for some years, and as the tenth anniversary of ''Breaking Bad'' neared, became interested in producing a work to follow Jesse's fate after this episode.<ref name=\"thr20190918\" /> This ultimately resulted in the film ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', which first aired on [[Netflix]] on October 11, 2019 and had limited theatric runs that weekend. ''El Camino'', named for the car Jesse escapes in, takes place immediately after the events of \"Felina\", and was considered by Gilligan to be a [[coda (music)|coda]] to the overall series to close out Jesse's story.<ref name=\"thr20190918\" /> Paul returned to star as Jesse, and the film includes brief appearances by Cranston, Plemons, Fraser, Jones, and Baker, among others.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Ratings ===\n\"Felina\" had the highest ratings of any episode of ''Breaking Bad'': 10.28 million in the United States, including 5.3 million adults aged 18\u201349.<ref name=\"sept29ratings\" /><ref name=\"zap\" /> The episode generated millions of online comments and [[Nielsen Holdings]] rankings established that it was the most-discussed episode on [[Twitter]] for that week.<ref name=\"social\" /> The popularity of the episode resulted in a 2,981 percent increase of sales of the [[Badfinger]] song \"[[Baby Blue (Badfinger song)|Baby Blue]]\" as well as a 9,000 percent increase in streaming over [[Spotify]].<ref name=\"badfinger\" />\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nUpon airing, the episode received nearly universal critical acclaim.<ref name=\"meta\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" /> In her review of \"Felina\", Donna Bowman of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an A rating, writing that \"Walt's purpose is fulfilled, and he just stops\".<ref name=\"avclub\" /> Seth Amitin at [[IGN]] also praised the episode, calling it \"fully satisfying\" and awarding it a score of 9.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Katey Rich agreed with these sentiments, calling the episode \"a deeply satisfying and surprisingly emotional finale\".<ref name=\"cb\" /> However, [[Emily Nussbaum]], writing in ''[[the New Yorker]]'', criticized the episode, claiming it so neatly wrapped up the series in Walt's favor that it seemed more like \"the dying fantasy on the part of Walter White, not something that was actually happening\".<ref name=\"ny\" />\n\nIn 2019 ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' ranked \"Felina\" as the 19th best out of the 62 total ''Breaking Bad'' episodes.<ref name=\"ring\" />\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe Goonies tested the machine-gun turret and proved that it was possible in real life.<ref name=\"pop\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"ama\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqk5a?context=1 |title=I am Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead music supervisor, Thomas Golubi\u0107, ASK ME ANYTHIN |date=October 5, 2013 |website=[[Reddit]] |access-date=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"amc\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/insider-podcast-season-5 |title=Breaking Bad \u2013 Insider Podcast Season 5 |website=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228104514/http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/insider-podcast-season-5 |archive-date=February 28, 2014 |access-date=October 7, 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"avclub\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/felina,102961/ |title=Felina |last=Bowman |first=Donna |date=September 29, 2013 |website=The A.V.

It is the sixteenth episode of [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|season five]] and the 62nd overall episode of the series. Written and directed by series creator [[Vince Gilligan]], it aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on September 29, 2013. It was followed by a [[sequel]] film, ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', which was made available on [[Netflix]] on October 11, 2019.\n\nThe plot involves [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] evading a nationwide manhunt for him in order to return to [[New Mexico]] and deliver the remaining profits from his illegal [[methamphetamine]] empire to his family. He also takes revenge on the Aryan Brotherhood gang who double-crossed him, killed his brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader|Hank]], took [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] captive and presented a threat to his family. Knowing the cancer will soon kill him, Walt revisits his former acquaintances to settle his affairs and prepare himself for the conflict and his death.\n\nUpon airing, \"Felina\" was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Several critics have called it one of the greatest series finales of all time.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter leaving the bar,{{Efn|As depicted in \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\".|name=|group=}} [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] departs [[New Hampshire]] in a stolen car. He returns to [[New Mexico]] and tracks down [[Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz]] at their new house in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. With help from [[Badger Mayhew]] and [[Skinny Pete]] using [[laser pointer]]s to spoof weapon [[laser sight]]s aimed on the couple, Walter coerces the Schwartzs to take his remaining $9.72&nbsp;million and establish a trust fund in their name to [[Walter White Jr.|Walt Jr.]], and as to \"make things right\" for minimizing Walt's involvement in Gray Matter. After paying Badger and Pete, he learns [[Jack Welker]]'s gang is distributing blue meth, and thus [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] is likely still alive as their \"cook\".\n\nOn his 52nd birthday, Walt purchases an [[M60 machine gun]]{{efn|Originally shown as a flashforward in \"[[Live Free or Die (Breaking Bad)|Live Free or Die]]\".}} and retrieves the [[ricin]] from his abandoned house.{{efn|Originally shown as a flashforward in \"[[Blood Money (Breaking Bad)|Blood Money]].\"}} He connects the machine gun to a pivoting turret inside the trunk of the car he is now driving, which is rigged to a remote [[Remote keyless system|unlock button]]. He interrupts [[Todd Alquist|Todd]] and [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle|Lydia]]'s regular meeting at a coffee shop and makes a business proposal, offering what he claims is a new formula for [[methylamine]]-free meth. Todd turns him down, but Lydia feigns interest to lure Walt into meeting with Jack, knowing he will kill Walt. Later, [[Skyler White|Skyler]] receives a phone call from [[Marie Schrader|Marie]], who warns her that Walt has been seen in Albuquerque. Walt, who is already with Skyler, leaves her the lottery ticket on which he had encoded the location of the money.{{efn|As depicted in \"[[Buried (Breaking Bad)|Buried]]\".}} Following the shootout in the desert, the coordinates now reveal [[Hank Schrader|Hank]] and [[Steven Gomez|Steve]]'s hidden grave, and Walt advises Skyler to use the location as leverage in negotiating a favorable plea bargain. Walt admits to Skyler that contrary to his previous claims that he only wanted to make money to support his family after his death, his life as a drug kingpin was for himself. Skyler allows Walt to see Holly while she sleeps. After leaving, Walt watches from afar as Walt Jr. arrives home from school.\n\nWalt drives to Jack's hideout and parks alongside the building. He meets inside with Jack and his men, but Jack refuses Walt's meth formula offer and orders him killed. Walt diverts Jack's attention by accusing him of going back on his promise to kill Jesse and instead partnering with him to continue the meth business. Jack responds by ordering that Jesse be brought from the [[Quonset hut]] where he is cooking meth so Jack can prove Jesse is a captive, not a partner. Upon seeing Jesse, Walt tackles him out of the line of fire and uses the remote unlock button to fire the machine gun through the building's walls; everyone but Jack, Todd, Jesse, and Walt are killed. Jesse strangles and kills Todd with the chain attached to his handcuffs, and then frees himself with Todd's keys. A wounded Jack attempts to bargain for his life with the location of the money he stole from Walt, but Walt kills him mid-sentence. Walt gives the gun to Jesse and asks Jesse to kill him. Jesse notices Walt is wounded from the machine gun's fire and refuses, telling Walt that if he wants to die he should do it himself.\n\nAs Jesse and Walt leave Jack's house, Walt answers Todd's phone and speaks with an obviously ill Lydia. He informs her that Jack and his gang are all dead and that she'll soon be dead too because he planted ricin in her [[stevia]] during the meeting at the coffee shop. Jesse and Walt exchange a farewell glance before Jesse flees in Todd's [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].{{efn|Events related to Jesse's escape were presented in the following film, ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]''.}} Walt enters the lab and smiles nostalgically as he admires the equipment, before he falls to the floor, collapsing from his wound. Police rush in with guns drawn as he lies motionless, a slight smile of satisfaction on his face, and dies soon after.<ref name=\"cos\" />\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Vince Gilligan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|alt=Gilligan at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con International|thumb|Series creator [[Vince Gilligan]] wrote and directed \"Felina\"]]\n\nProduction on \"Felina\" and the ''Breaking Bad'' series concluded on April 2, 2013, according to Cranston.<ref name=\"prod\" />\n\nOn September 18, 2013, it was announced that both \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\" and \"Felina\" would run 75 minutes, including commercials.<ref name=\"hr\" /> The actual runtime of the episodes is 55 minutes. The episode was written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan.\n\n=== Title reference and music ===\nThe episode title, \"Felina\", is inspired by the character Feleena from the song \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\" by [[Marty Robbins]], which plays a major role during the episode.<ref name=\"avclub\" />\n\nThe story of \"El Paso\" closely mirrors Walter White's character arc in the final season of Breaking Bad. Walt, who has become a notorious criminal, flees from Albuquerque, living as a fugitive. Despite this being a successful outcome in the context of the story, he finds himself increasingly isolated and dissatisfied. Because his desire for emotional closure outweighs his fear of capture and death, he is eventually driven to return to the scene of his crimes, where he finds the closure he seeks but ultimately meets his end. \"El Paso\" is on a Marty Robbins cassette in Walt's car, and is played during the episode. The writers changed the subject's name from ''Feleena'' to ''Felina'' so that, when used as the title, it could serve as an anagram of ''Finale''.<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref name=\"amc\" />\n\nThere are also a number of fan theories regarding the significance of the music: the word Felina can be broken up into three different symbols of chemical elements found in the [[periodic table]]: [[iron]] (Fe), [[lithium]] (Li), and [[sodium]] (Na). The title was interpreted by some as [[blood, sweat and tears|\"blood, meth and tears\"]] because iron is a predominant element in blood, lithium is sometimes used in methamphetamine production, and sodium is a component of tears.<ref name=\"ds\" /> According to Eric Brown of ''[[International Business Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\"In its pure form&nbsp;... methamphetamine is composed solely of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N), no lithium involved. However, there are multiple ways to synthesize meth from other ingredients, and several involve lithium. The [[Birch reduction]], also called the \"Nazi method,\" mixes lithium and ammonia to create a reaction. Another, called the \"Shake 'n' Bake\" method, involved throwing lithium and several other ingredients into a single pot to create the drug. Both methods are extremely dangerous, as lithium is a highly volatile element. Unfortunately, there's a big hole in this theory: Walt never uses a lithium-based synthesis in the show.&nbsp;...

Neither one uses lithium at any point, shooting a big hole in this theory.\"<ref name=\"ds\" /><ref name=\"decoding\" /><ref name=\"time\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[Badfinger]]'s \"[[Baby Blue (Badfinger song)|Baby Blue]]\" is played during the final scene. According to series creator Vince Gilligan, this is reference to the high-quality blue meth Walt had produced over the previous seasons and his life as a drug kingpin which the main character at last recognizes he had enjoyed.<ref name=\"rs\" /> According to ''Rolling Stone'', the music supervisors on the show disagreed with Gilligan's choice for the final song;<ref name=\"rs\" /> however, music supervisor Thomas Golubi\u0107 stated that \"journalists sometimes try to create drama where there isn't any\" and that his quotes were \"mis-represented\".<ref name=\"ama\" /> \"Baby Blue\" became an obvious choice as the editing came closer to completion with Golubi\u0107 describing the process of finalizing the song:\n\n{{quote|Before I saw the scene, I pulled together a number of ideas&nbsp;\u2013 one which I thought worked pretty beautifully against picture: [[The Bees (band)|The Bees]]' \"No More Excuses\"&nbsp;\u2013 but once I saw that beautiful shot, and saw the scene in context, I realized why Vince was so strongly attached to the Badfinger song. It's tricky for us as music supervisors in that we keep pulling together ideas and revising them. None of us know the right answer until we are at the very end of that process and have cut and locked picture to work with. Vince is just really talented at knowing what the final effect he is looking for, and knew early on that Badfinger's \"Baby Blue\" was the right choice for what he was looking to do. It took until the final picture was assembled that I was able to also see what a fantastic choice it was.<ref name=\"ama\" />|source=}}\n\n=== ''El Camino'' ===\nAfter the conclusion of the series, Gilligan had considered Jesse's fate, stating that rather than getting caught by police, he had envisioned that Jesse would end up in Alaska to start his life anew.<ref name=\"ew\" /> He had mulled this idea over for some years, and as the tenth anniversary of ''Breaking Bad'' neared, became interested in producing a work to follow Jesse's fate after this episode.<ref name=\"thr20190918\" /> This ultimately resulted in the film ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', which first aired on [[Netflix]] on October 11, 2019 and had limited theatric runs that weekend. ''El Camino'', named for the car Jesse escapes in, takes place immediately after the events of \"Felina\", and was considered by Gilligan to be a [[coda (music)|coda]] to the overall series to close out Jesse's story.<ref name=\"thr20190918\" /> Paul returned to star as Jesse, and the film includes brief appearances by Cranston, Plemons, Fraser, Jones, and Baker, among others.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Ratings ===\n\"Felina\" had the highest ratings of any episode of ''Breaking Bad'': 10.28 million in the United States, including 5.3 million adults aged 18\u201349.<ref name=\"sept29ratings\" /><ref name=\"zap\" /> The episode generated millions of online comments and [[Nielsen Holdings]] rankings established that it was the most-discussed episode on [[Twitter]] for that week.<ref name=\"social\" /> The popularity of the episode resulted in a 2,981 percent increase of sales of the [[Badfinger]] song \"[[Baby Blue (Badfinger song)|Baby Blue]]\" as well as a 9,000 percent increase in streaming over [[Spotify]].<ref name=\"badfinger\" />\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nUpon airing, the episode received nearly universal critical acclaim.<ref name=\"meta\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" /> In her review of \"Felina\", Donna Bowman of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an A rating, writing that \"Walt's purpose is fulfilled, and he just stops\".<ref name=\"avclub\" /> Seth Amitin at [[IGN]] also praised the episode, calling it \"fully satisfying\" and awarding it a score of 9.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Katey Rich agreed with these sentiments, calling the episode \"a deeply satisfying and surprisingly emotional finale\".<ref name=\"cb\" /> However, [[Emily Nussbaum]], writing in ''[[the New Yorker]]'', criticized the episode, claiming it so neatly wrapped up the series in Walt's favor that it seemed more like \"the dying fantasy on the part of Walter White, not something that was actually happening\".<ref name=\"ny\" />\n\nIn 2019 ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' ranked \"Felina\" as the 19th best out of the 62 total ''Breaking Bad'' episodes.<ref name=\"ring\" />\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe [[MythBusters]] tested the machine-gun turret and proved that it was possible in real life.<ref name=\"pop\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"ama\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqk5a?context=1 |title=I am Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead music supervisor, Thomas Golubi\u0107, ASK ME ANYTHIN |date=October 5, 2013 |website=[[Reddit]] |access-date=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"amc\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/insider-podcast-season-5 |title=Breaking Bad \u2013 Insider Podcast Season 5 |website=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228104514/http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/insider-podcast-season-5 |archive-date=February 28, 2014 |access-date=October 7, 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"avclub\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/felina,102961/ |title=Felina |last=Bowman |first=Donna |date=September 29, 2013 |website=The A.V.
