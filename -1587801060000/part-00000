He left school at age nine to work as an apprentice; first as a hairdresser and then as a goldsmith. At eleven he began his apprenticeship in the workshop of Giuseppe Grandi who introduced him to the working of marble. His ability to finish the marble made him famous at the age of eighteen. From 1888 he worked for Federico Villa, which made him known as one of the most famous sculptors of the Lombardi era. At the same time, Wildt could continue his studies at the [[Brera Academy|Brera]], the School of Applied Arts and then all 'Accademia di Belle Arti.\n\n==First exhibition==\nIn 1893 he exhibited the first work, a portrait of his wife, the Society for Fine Arts in Milan, which was immediately captured by the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome. From 1894 he worked for Franz Rose, a Prussian collector, with whom he signed a contract for a period of eighteen years. With this protection, Wildt could immerse himself in his work, participating regularly in exhibitions held in Milan, Monaco, Zurich, Berlin and Dresden. <!--Especially admired [[Adolf von Hildebrand]] and [[Auguste Rodin]] was so fascinated him well for the experiments with giving his marble sculptures opalescent transparency.-->\n\n==Later career==\nAfter the death of his patron Rose in 1912, Wildt was forced to compete for the first time with the art market. In 1913, he was awarded the Premio Principe Umberto for his design for the fountain show at The trilogy of Secession of Monaco, then exhibited in the courtyard of the Humane Society in Milan. From 1914 onwards he was able to regularly attend various international exhibitions. He also held a staff in 1919 at the Galleria Pesaro in Milan, while in 1921, 1924 and 1926 he exhibited at the [[Venice Biennale]]. In 1921 he founded his School in Milan Marble which then became part of the 'Accademia di Brera and was developed in 1927 in a three-year program. Among his most famous pupils were [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Fausto Melotti]] and Luigi Broggini.\n\nWildt died in Milan in 1931.\n\n==Artwork==\nWildt had a strong background in late nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]], and his sculpture was strongly influenced by the [[Secession (art)|Secession]] and by [[Art Nouveau]]. It is characterized by complex [[symbol]]ism and by definition is almost gothic in its forms. The extreme smoothness of their surfaces gives his marble busts their absolute purity and plastic integrity that coexists with an almost frenzied dramatic feeling.\nFor this, Wildt is on the threshold of 'Expressionism that proves particularly sad and upset in the expression of his self-portrait of 1908.\nA significant body of his masterpieces is present in the [[Pinacoteca civica di Forl\u00ec|Civic Museums]] of [[Forl\u00ec]]: ''Fulcieri Paulucci de 'Calboli'' (1919), ''Saint Lucia'' (1926), ''St. Francis of Assisi'' (1926), ''Mask of sorrow or Portrait'' (1908\u20131909), ''Lux'' (1920), ''The fountain santa'' (1921), ''Protection of children or little ones'' (1918).<ref name=\"scultura-italiana\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Biografie/Wildt.htm|title=Adolfo Wildt|language=Italian|accessdate=5 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029161211/http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Biografie/Wildt.htm|archivedate=2009-10-29|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Adolfo Wildt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wildt, Adolfo}}\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Academy of Italy]]\n[[Category:1868 births]]\n[[Category:1931 deaths]]\n[[Category:Italian people of Swiss descent]]\n[[Category:People from Milan]]\n[[Category:Art Nouveau sculptors]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:Italian male sculptors]]\n[[Category:Brera Academy alumni]]\n[[Category:Brera Academy faculty]]\n[[Category:19th-century male artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox artist\n| bgcolour      = #6495ED\n| name          = Adolfo Wildt\n| image         = Adolfo Wildt (1868-1931) Autoritratto (Maschera del dolore) (1909).jpg\n| imagesize     = 150px\n| caption       = Self portrait (1909)\n| birth_name     = \n| birth_date     = {{birth date|1868|3|1}}\n| birth_place      = [[Milan]], [[Italy]]\n| death_date     = {{death date and age|1931|3|12|1868|3|1}}\n| death_place    = [[Milan, Italy]]\n| resting_place = \n| resting_place_coordinates = \n| nationality   = [[Italy|Italian]]\n| field         = [[sculpture]]\n| training      = [[Brera Academy|Brera]]\n| movement      = [[Modernism]]\n| works         = \n| patrons       = \n| influenced by =\n| influenced    =\n| awards        = \n}}\n\n'''Adolfo Wildt''' (March 1, 1868 \u2013 March 12, 1931) was an Italian sculptor<ref name=\"sapere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sapere.it/tca/MainApp?srvc=dcmnt&url=/tc/arte/articoli/DP/A/Scultura/Wildt.jsp|title=Il maestro dimenticato|last=Pontiggia|first=Elena|work=Sapere|language=Italian|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref> whose works, which blend simplicity and sophistication, led the way for numerous modernist sculptors.<!--Many scholars of art history's great artistic meaning claim. -->[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=it&ie=UTF-8&sl=it&tl=en&u=http://www.sapere.it/tca/MainApp%3Fsrvc%3Ddcmnt%26url%3D/tc/arte/articoli/DP/A/Scultura/Wildt.jsp&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&usg=ALkJrhiJZ8KE8GtM0SMRp7XYHHexEut1Xg]\n\n==Early life==\nWildt was born in Milan to a [[Swiss]] family who had settled in [[Lombardy]].

{"title_page": "Claude Vermette", "text_new": "'''Claude Vermette''' [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts|R.C.A.]] is a Canadian [[Ceramic art|ceramist]] and [[painter]] who was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], August 10, 1930  and who died in [[Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts]], April 21, 2006. Artist of international reputation, he made important contributions to the ceramic arts in Canada, especially in the field of architectural ceramics of which he is considered a pioneer.\n\n== Biography ==\nAs a ceramist who worked in the architectural field, Claude Vermette is a pioneer in Qu\u00e9bec and in Canada with regards to this type of artistic expression. The bursts of colours of his ceramics, the warmth of their hues and the play of their textures brought a human dimension in architectural spaces that were often grey and frigid. In his paintings as well as in his prints and watercolours, Claude Vermette pursued this bold approach while constantly renewing and expanding the possibilities of colour and light.\n\n===Studies===\nA native of [[Montreal]], Claude Vermette studied art under the guidance of Brother Jerome, c.s.c. at Notre-Dame College while also attending  the [[Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Laurent]] and the college of the Clercs de Saint-Viateur for his academic studies.  Through his contact with Brother Jerome, he met [[Paul-\u00c9mile Borduas]] and joined the [[Automatiste]] group of emerging artists.  He was considered too young by Borduas to sign the 1948 \"[[Refus Global]]\" (Global denial), but he was present at the launch of this manifesto, which was destined to become famous in Qu\u00e9bec's contemporary history. Drawing, painting and ceramics were then his main modes of expression.\n\n===Formative years===\n\nHis first exhibitions in 1948, 1950 and 1952 caused him to be noticed by art critics who praised his talent and perceived the promise a bright future. In 1952, his interest in ceramics expanded during a study tour in Europe and especially in Italy where he met the architect [[Gio Ponti]], a major player in the rebirth of modern Italian design and founder of the magazine [[Domus]] and the sculptor-ceramist [[Fausto Melotti]].  Another decisive encounter is that of the Finnish architect, [[Alvar Aalto]].\n\nThereafter, Claude Vermette concentrated his efforts on architectural  ceramics for which he created new forms of composition for the clay, a wider variety of modules for tiles and bricks, and new patented enamels. All these innovations resulted in much appreciation regarding the quality and sustainability of his ceramics, notably in the context of the Canadian climate and its gruelling winters. His bricks and tiles also earned him the 1962 first prize for industrial design.\n\n===Architectural Ceramic===\n\nIn 1953, the then 23 years old artist produced his first great work in ceramics: the huge background of the main altar and the whole ceiling of the new chapel of the Seminary of Chicoutimi. There followed a career of twenty-five years as ceramist characterized by close collaboration with architects and engineers, during which he produced large works in more than a hundred public buildings, including pavilions and buildings connected to the [[Expo 67|Montreal World's Fair]] in 1967, at [[Osaka]] in 1970, at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] held in Montreal as well as in many schools, churches, courthouses (including those in Montreal, St-Hyacinthe and at Perc\u00e9 in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula ), hospitals (including those of Notre-Dame and Marie-Enfant in Montr\u00e9al, and Amos in Abitibi), universities (including that of Montr\u00e9al, McGill, Laval and Sherbrooke), government buildings, airports (Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Mirabel and Molton), in more than a dozen [[Montreal Metro|Montreal subway stations]] (including Saint-Laurent, Peel, Berri-UQAM, Laurier) and other buildings, including those of General Motors in New York City, MacMillan Bloedel in Vancouver, Bell Canada in Toronto, Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, Texaco Canada and Quebecor to name a few more. He also created many works, such as ceramic fireplaces mantles and wall murals for private mansions.  His works are also found in museums, including the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.mnbaq.org/fr/artiste/600001390|title=Claude Vermette|website=www.collections.mnbaq.org|accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Engravings, watercolours and paintings===\n\nClaude Vermette also felt the need to pursue research that initially evolved into the creation of small-scale ceramic works where he experimented with new forms, textures and glazes and later also included engravings, sculptures and especially painting.  He was further distinguished by mastery in engraving, taking advantage of relief materials that linked the play of light: evidenced by its white on white prints and art book Blanc-Seeing when it operates in its many variations, the latter accompanied by texts by the poet Eugene Cloutier.  These prints have inspired the realization of small sculptures.\n\nThe artist uses his experiences as game textures, reliefs and light of his prints  into white concrete works, thereby making the building for the Caisse populaire Laurier in Ottawa a dozen bas-reliefs of white concrete, large and small dimensions, varying textures, thicknesses and relief printed to the material.\n\nVermette was also interested in creating watercolor works of all sizes such as, among them,  a giant mural of over 80 meters long at Bell Trinity Square Office in Toronto. Another book of art is born, Gestes de Libert\u00e9, this time in collaboration with the economist, Andr\u00e9 Raynauld. Art and science! This challenge of uniting the work of a painter and that of an economist is reflected in the execution of this book which includes an abstract watercolor where dominate color and movement and a series of nine articles on the theme of freedom.\n\n===Last years===\n\nIn the last thirty years of his life, Claude Vermette devoted most of his activity to painting. His works has been exhibited in Canada and abroad and is represented in the collections of public institutions, large corporations as well as private collections.\n \nAt the time of his death, he had just finished replacing the five exterior aluminium enameled murals he had created for the walls of the Beaver Lake Pavilion on Mount-Royal in Montr\u00e9al, which were initially made in ceramic in 1958 and were unfortunately victims of demolition.  This historic pavilion was renovated by the City of Montreal and inaugurated in January 2006.  To mark the quality of the achievement, the City was awarded the [[Orange Prize]] 2006 by the organization Sauvons Montreal in category \"Intervention heritage.\n\nHe was the husband of the artist [[Mariette Rousseau-Vermette]], tapestry weaver who, by the aesthetic and technical qualities of the tapestries and the impressive number of monumental works, has earned an international reputation. The couple who had two children lived in Ste-Adele. Both had a professional art career that spans over a period of sixty years.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Claude-Vermette Studio, Personal Archives, years 1946-2006 and C.V.\n*''Au vernissage d'un peintre de 16 ans'', La Presse, 3 juin 1947, 1\u00e8re colonne\n*''Un artiste est n\u00e9'', Le Petit Journal, 27 janvier 1952, p.&nbsp;51, 5\u00e8me colonne\n*Irene Kon, ''Claude Vermette'', Canadian Art, November 1960, p.p.&nbsp;359- 363\n*''Les travaux d'un jeune artiste qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois seront l'objet d'un hommage sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 San Francisco'', La Presse, samedi, 14 mai 1960, p.&nbsp;36\n*Michel Lapalme, ''Une nouvelle industrie: celle de la beaut\u00e9'', Le magazine Maclean, novembre 1969, vol.9, no.11, p.&nbsp;52-55\n*Ren\u00e9 Viau, ''Claude Vermette et la c\u00e9ramique architecturale'', D\u00e9cormag, avril 1978, p.&nbsp;74-78\n*''Industrial Crafts, Claude Vermette'', Canadian Art, March\u2013April 1961, no.72\n*Rosalind Pepall, ''L'oiseau d'or de Claude Vermette - Un bijou d'acquisition'', Collage, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Montr\u00e9al, automne 1998, p.&nbsp;16\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vermette, Claude}}\n[[Category:Montreal Metro artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian painters]]\n[[Category:Canadian male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Canadian painters]]\n[[Category:Canadian ceramists]]\n[[Category:French Quebecers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]\n[[Category:20th-century ceramists]]\n[[Category:21st-century ceramists]]\n", "text_old": "'''Claude Vermette''' [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts|R.C.A.]] is a Canadian [[Ceramic art|ceramist]] and [[painter]] who was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], August 10, 1930  and who died in [[Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts]], April 21, 2006.

The main tree species are [[Strychnos nux-vomica|kochila]], kalicha, belo, kangada, giringa, sunari, [[Sal tree|sal]], kumbhi, jamu, [[Karanj (tree)|karanja]], [[teak]] and sidha. Male bamboo (''[[Dendrocalamus strictus]]'') has a very restricted distribution. Common medicinal plants of the sanctuary are duramari, baidanka (''[[Mucuna pruriens]]''), brudhadaraka, bhuinlimbo, [[Tinospora cordifolia|guduchi lata]], salparni (''[[Desmodium gangeticum]]''), satabari, bhuin-kakharu, indrajaba, thalkudi, apamaranga, [[Holarrhena floribunda|kurchi]], and patalgaruda. A few species of ground [[orchids]], [[ferns]], club [[mosses]], [[bryophytes]] and [[lichens]] are distributed in shady wet pockets and rock escarpments.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Chandaka Bhubaneswar.me.jpg|thumb|Elephants inside Chandaka Dampara forest]]\n[[File:Deras Dam Bhubaneswar.me.jpg|thumb|Deras Dam, located within the reserve]]\n{{Commons category|Deras Dam}}\n\nThe [[Indian elephant]] is the flagship species and indicative of the potential productivity of the habitat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pachyderm Census to Begin from May 25|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Pachyderm-Census-to-Begin-from-May-25/2015/04/27/article2785217.ece|publisher=[[The New Indian Express]]|date=27 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=80-year-old elephant dies in Orissa reserve|url=http://www.topnews.in/80yearold-elephant-dies-orissa-reserve-2236376|work=TopNews|date=15 November 2009}}</ref> The [[leopard]] is in the apex of biological pyramid.

Often described as \"the Olympics of the [[art world]]\", participation in the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\nOutside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\n== Giardini national pavilions ==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Nation\n!

Some countries own pavilion buildings in the [[Giardini della Biennale]] while others rent buildings throughout the city, but each country controls its own selection process and production costs.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe Venice Biennale is an international [[art biennial]] exhibition held in [[Venice, Italy]]. Often described as \"the Olympics of the [[art world]]\", participation in the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\nOutside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.{{sfn|Russeth|2019}}\n\n== Giardini national pavilions ==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Nation\n!

An age of decline began which worsened when Attila, King of the [[Huns]], sacked and devastated the city in 452&nbsp;AD. In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence.

The city-state was born, an expression of the new political power of the city and its will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help. This brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\n\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Suvorov in Milan.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial reception of Russian Field Marshal [[Alexander Suvorov]] in Milan, April 1799]]\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan. [[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, to Austrian control in 1815.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922.

Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. It is governed by a Regional Council, composed of 80 members elected for a five-year term.  On 26 March 2018, a list of candidates of the [[Centre-right coalition]], a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Attilio Fontana, largely won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists, liberals and ecologists and a third party candidate from the populist [[Five Stars Movement]]. The conservatives have governed the region almost uninterruptedly since 1970. The regional council has 48 members from the Centre-right coalition, 18 from the [[Centre-left coalition]] and 13 from the Five Star Movement.

In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] graveyard, built in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] style between 1863 and 1866.\n\nThe tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Gi\u00f2 Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956\u201360), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956\u201358), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]] in downtown Milan and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]).

It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help.

As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Suvorov in Milan.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial reception of Russian Field Marshal [[Alexander Suvorov]] in Milan, April 1799]]\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan. [[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, to Austrian control in 1815.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922.

The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Gi\u00f2 Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956\u201360), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956\u201358), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]] in downtown Milan and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]].

It hosts exhibitions and events highlighting contemporary Italian design, urban planning, architecture, music, and media arts, emphasising the relationship between art and industry.\n\nMilan in the 20th century was the epicentre of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] artistic movement. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]], the founder of Italian [[Futurism]] wrote in his 1909 \"''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]''\" (in Italian, ''Manifesto Futuristico''), that Milan was \"''grande...tradizionale e futurista''\" (\"''grand...traditional and futuristic''\", in English). [[Umberto Boccioni]] was also an important [[Futurism]] artist who worked in the city.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), ''[[ossobuco]]'' (braised [[veal]] shank served with a condiment called ''[[gremolata]]''), [[risotto|risotto alla milanese]] (with [[saffron]] and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed [[tripe]] with beans), and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).\n\nSeason-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for [[Easter]], ''pane dei morti'' (\"bread of the (Day of the ) Dead\", cookies flavoured with [[cinnamon]]) for [[All Souls' Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas.

It featured works by Vincenzo Accame, Irma Black, Vincenzo Ferrari, [[Ketty La Rocca]], Arrigo Lora Totino, [[Magdalo Mussio]], [[Maurizio Nannucci]], Anna Oberto, Luca Maria Patella, [[Lamberto Pignotti]], Sarenco, Adriano Spatola, and Luigi Tola. The exhibition was thought as a complement to the 1993 [[Venice Biennale]], which was showing the works of nine artists of the ANS collection: [[Nanni Balestrini]], [[Ugo Carrega]], [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]], Emilio Isgr\u00f2, [[Eugenio Miccini]], Martino Oberto, Franco Vaccari, [[Patrizia Vicinelli]], and [[Emilio Villa]]. ''Linguaggio/immagine'' also included works by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Emilio Scanavino]], Vincenzo Agnetti, [[Alighiero Boetti]], and several young artists such as Maurizio Arcangeli, Mariella Bettineschi, Gianni Gangai, Francesco La Fosca, and Alessandro Traina.\n\nFrom 28 February to 30 March 1994 the ANS exhibited ''Una colonna un bar una voce'' (''A Column a Coffee Shop a Voice''), organized in collaboration with the [[Venice Biennale]]. It exhibited the works by [[Nanni Balestrini]], Franco Vaccari, and Patrizia Vicinelli that had been selected for the Biennale. The following exhibition was ''Oggetti di poesia'' (''Objects of Poetry''), dedicated to [[Emilio Villa]]. ''Lo spazio della scrittura'' (''The Space of Writing''), exhibited in the same year, included works by Vincenzo Accame, [[Nanni Balestrini]], Irma Blank, [[Ugo Carrega]], Luciano Caruso, Corrado D'Ottavi, Emilio Isgr\u00f2, [[Ketty La Rocca]], Stelio Maria Martini, [[Eugenio Miccini]], [[Magdalo Mussio]], Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Luca Maria Patella, [[Lamberto Pignotti]], Sarenco, Adriano Spatola, and Franco Vaccari. It was shown in [[Paris]], [[France]] from 5 May to 25 May 1994, then in [[Lille]] from 31 May to 22 June, and finally at the Ignaz and Mischa Epper Foundation in [[Ascona]], [[Switzerland]] from 30 July to 4 September 1994. A [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] was also organized, featuring [[Nanni Balestrini]], [[Paolo Fabbri]], and [[Lamberto Pignotti]]. In 1995 there was a new exhibition about [[Terry Atkinson]].\n\nIn the 1990s the ANS organized frequent cultural events, including the series ''Parola e immagine'' (''Word and Image'', 1990), with Luciano Caramel, Vittorio Fagone, Vanni Scheiwiller, Emilio Tadini and [[Gillo Dorfles]], ''Alfabeto in libert\u00e0'' (''Alphabet in Freedom'', 1991) with [[Cesare Segre]], Tomaso Kemeny, Rossana Bossaglia and [[Tullio Crali]], a conference about [[Ezra Pound]] with Kemeny and Scheiwiller (1993), and a series of meetings about [[Futurism]] featuring Bossaglia, Caramel, Claudia Salaris, Enrico Crispolti, and Anty Pansera (1995).\n\n===The transfer to Mart and Museion===\nAt the end of the 1990s Della Grazia noticed that the preservation and administration of the Archive were becoming too complicated and expensive to be managed by one person. Advised by Francesco Conz, he asked Pier Luigi Siena and Andreas Hapkmeyer of the [[Museion]] of [[Bozen]] to host the collection in their museum. However, the Museion did not have enough space for the entire ANS collection, so Della Grazia decided to involve Gabriella Belli, director of the [[Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto|Mart]] museum of [[Trento]] and [[Rovereto]]. The collection was then split, the Museion kept a larger part of the artworks, and the Mart kept some artworks and the whole archives and library of the ANS. In October 1998 Della Grazia made an agreement with Mart, and in February 1999 the archives and library were moved to the new venue. The ANS archives include, apart from the internal archive of the association, the Fraccaro-Carrega [[fonds]] containing the papers of art collector Marco Fraccaro and visual poet [[Ugo Carrega]].\n\nThe library of the ANS, preserved at the Mart museum, includes more than 10,000 volumes, among them 600 [[artist's book]]s and hundreds of [[Futurism|futurist]] first editions, and 500 art [[magazine]]s including about 100 international artist magazines. It also includes essays about the [[history of writing]], books about [[visual poetry]], [[avant-garde]] magazines, and several rare works of [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], and other artistic movements. For instance, the Mart hosts the ''Libro imbullonato'' (''Bolted Book'') by [[Fortunato Depero]] (1927), ''Chimismi lirici'' (''Lyrical Chemism'') by [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1915), and the ''Litolatte'' by Tullio d'Albisola and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]. The Mart also preserves drawings and graphical artworks by artists such as [[Eugenio Miccini]], Emilio Isgr\u00f2, [[Lamberto Pignotti]], Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Vincenzo Ferrari, [[Magdalo Mussio]], Rolando Mignani, Franco Vaccari, Walter Valentini, Alain Arias-Misson, Giuseppe Desiato, Alik Cavaliere, Emilio Tadini, Luca Maria Patella, [[Emilio Villa]], and Giovanna Sandri.\n\nThe ANS collection hosted by the [[Museion]] includes about 2,000 works by exponents of [[concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[visual poetry]], such as [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Terry Atkinson]], Franco Vaccari ([[conceptual art]]), [[Joseph Beuys]], [[John Cage]], [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Ben Vautier]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Robert Watts]] ([[Fluxus]]).\n\n===The 2000s===\nAfter the transfer, Della Grazia continued to organize exhibitions and research. The books and documents hosted by Mart were lent to ''Poesie concrete brasilienne'' (''Brazilian Concrete Poetry''), held in [[Marseille]], [[France]] in 2001,  ''Alfabeto in sogno'' (''Alphabet in Dreams'') in [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Italy]] in 2002, and ''Propaganda, cultura e mito nell'editoria italiana'' (''Propaganda, Culture and Myth in Italian Publishing'') held in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]] in 2004. In the same year the [[artist's book]]s of ANS were lent to ''Deliberatamente. Il libro d'artista negli anni '60 e '70'' (''Deliberately. The Artist Book in the 1960s and 1970s'') in [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]] and to ''Libri taglienti esplosivi luminosi'' (''Sharp Explosive Bright Books''), held in 2005 in [[Trento]] and 2006 in [[Bozen]]. In 2006 they were also shown in [[Bologna]] at the ''Primo amore. La passione di un collezionista'' (''First Love. The Passion of a Collector'') exhibition.\n\nOn 10 November 2007 the Mart opened the ''La parola nell'arte'' (''The Word in Art'') exhibition, organized in collaboration with the [[Museion]] and curated by a committee headed by Giorgio Zanchetti and composed of Gabriella Belli, [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], Andreas Hapkemeyer, Nicoletta Boschiero, Paola Pettenella, Melania Gazzotti, Daniela Ferrari, and Julia Trolp. The exhibition contained more than 800 artworks, both from the Mart and other international collections. On 23 May 2008 the Museion moved to a new building, and director Corinne Diserens curated the exhibition ''Sguardo periferico & corpo collettivo'' (''Peripheral Look & Collective Body''), including works by Gianfranco Baruchello, [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[George Brecht]], [[G\u00fcnter Brus]], [[John Cage]], Calvin Sumsion, Paul de Vree, Jakov Dorfmann, [[John Heartfield]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Arturo Schwarz]], Ugo La Pietra, [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Hermann Nitsch]], Anna Oberto, Claudio Parmiggiani, [[Man Ray]], Sarenco, [[Cy Twombly]], Franco Vaccari, [[Ben Vautier]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]], [[Emmett Williams]].\n\nIn 2013 the Archive started the Verbo Visuale Virtuale project in collaboration with the Bruno Kessler Foundation, with the aim of building a [[digital archive]] of verbo-visual art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dh.fbk.eu/projects/vvv-verbo-visuale-virtuale-la-piattaforma-di-ricerca-interattiva-dellarte-verbo-visuale|title=VVV \u2013 Verbo Visuale Virtuale: la piattaforma di ricerca interattiva dell'arte verbo-visuale|publisher=Bruno Kessler Foundation|accessdate=12 November 2014|language=Italian}}</ref> This project was made possible by a generous grant from the CARITRO Foundation (Trento, Italy).\n\n==Some artists of the ANS collections==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*Vincenzo Accame\n*[[Carla Accardi]]\n*Vincenzo Agnetti\n*Fernando Aguiar\n*[[Rafael Alberti]]\n*Jeremy Alder\n*Maurizio Arcangeli\n*Alain Arias-Misson\n*[[Terry Atkinson]]\n*Filippo Avalle\n*Michael Baldwin\n*[[Nanni Balestrini]]\n*[[Mirell\na Bentivoglio]]\n*[http://www.documentsdartistes.org/artistes/berard/repro.html St\u00e9phane B\u00e9rard]\n[[*Mariella Bettineschi]]\n*[[Remo Bianco]]\n*Tomaso Binga\n*Julien Blaine\n*[[Agostino Bonalumi]]\n*Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bory\n*Antonino Bove\n{{col-break}}\n*[[George Brecht]]\n*[[Joan Brossa]]\n*[[Ugo Carrega]]\n*Luciano Caruso\n*Ugo Castagnotto\n*Alik Cavaliere\n*Mauro Ceolin\n*[[Mario Ceroli]]\n*[[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]]\n*Hsiao Chin\n*[[Henri Chopin]]\n*Luciano Civettini\n*Ken Cox\n*[[Dadamaino]]\n*Herman Damen\n*Betty Danon\n*Angelo de Aquino\n*[[Augusto de Campos]]\n*Paul de Vree\n{{col-break}}\n*Joe Di Donato\n*Corrado D'Ottavi\n*[[Amelia Etlinger]]\n*Vincenzo Ferrari\n*[[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]\n*Carlo Finotti\n*Raffaella Formenti\n*John Furnival\n*Jochen Gerz\n*[[Dick Higgins]]\n*Emilio Isgr\u00f2\n*Francesco La Fosca\n*Liliana Landi\n*Arrigo Lora Totino\n*Stelio Maria Martini\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]\n*Hansjorg Mayer\n*[[Fausto Melotti]]\n*Plinio Mesciulam\n*[[Eugenio Miccini]]\n{{col-break}}\n*Rolando Mignani\n*Ottonella Mocellin\n*[[Ignazio Moncada (pittore)|Ignazio Moncada]]\n*Rudolf Mumprecht\n*[[Bruno Munari]]\n*[[Maurizio Nannucci]]\n*[[Hermann Nitsch]]\n*Anna Oberto\n*Martino Oberto\n*Luciano Ori\n*[[Giulio Paolini]]\n*Claudio Parmiggiani\n*Luca Maria Patella\n*[[Nicola Pellegrini]]\n*Michele Perfetti\n*Osvaldo Peruzzi\n*[[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]\n*[[Pablo Picasso]]\n*[[D\u00e9cio Pignatari]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Lamberto Pignotti]]\n*[[Antonio Porta (author)|Antonio Porta]]\n*Luca Quartana\n*Giovanna Sandri\n*Sarenco\n*[[Emilio Scanavino]]\n*Roberto Sanesi\n*Giangiacomo Spadari\n*Adriano Spatola\n*[[Mauro Staccioli]]\n*Shohachiro Takahashi\n*[[Jean Tinguely]]\n*Franco Vaccari\n*Walter Valentini\n*Ji\u0159\u00ed Valoch\n*[[Emilio Villa]]\n*[[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]\n*[[Emmett Williams]]\n*William Xerra\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Exhibitions==\n*''Sei lirici della Poesia Visuale internazionale'' (1990)\n*''Poesia Concreta in Brasile'' (1991)\n*''Martino Oberto (OM)'' (1992)\n*''Linguaggio/immagine'' (1993)\n*''Una colonna un bar una voce'' (1994)\n*''Oggetti di poesia.

The exhibition was thought as a complement to the 1993 [[Venice Biennale]], which was showing the works of nine artists of the ANS collection: [[Nanni Balestrini]], [[Ugo Carrega]], [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]], Emilio Isgr\u00f2, [[Eugenio Miccini]], Martino Oberto, Franco Vaccari, [[Patrizia Vicinelli]], and [[Emilio Villa]]. ''Linguaggio/immagine'' also included works by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Emilio Scanavino]], Vincenzo Agnetti, [[Alighiero Boetti]], and several young artists such as Maurizio Arcangeli, Mariella Bettineschi, Gianni Gangai, Francesco La Fosca, and Alessandro Traina.\n\nFrom 28 February to 30 March 1994 the ANS exhibited ''Una colonna un bar una voce'' (''A Column a Coffee Shop a Voice''), organized in collaboration with the [[Venice Biennale]]. It exhibited the works by [[Nanni Balestrini]], Franco Vaccari, and Patrizia Vicinelli that had been selected for the Biennale. The following exhibition was ''Oggetti di poesia'' (''Objects of Poetry''), dedicated to [[Emilio Villa]]. ''Lo spazio della scrittura'' (''The Space of Writing''), exhibited in the same year, included works by Vincenzo Accame, [[Nanni Balestrini]], Irma Blank, [[Ugo Carrega]], Luciano Caruso, Corrado D'Ottavi, Emilio Isgr\u00f2, [[Ketty La Rocca]], Stelio Maria Martini, [[Eugenio Miccini]], [[Magdalo Mussio]], Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Luca Maria Patella, [[Lamberto Pignotti]], Sarenco, Adriano Spatola, and Franco Vaccari. It was shown in [[Paris]], [[France]] from 5 May to 25 May 1994, then in [[Lille]] from 31 May to 22 June, and finally at the Ignaz and Mischa Epper Foundation in [[Ascona]], [[Switzerland]] from 30 July to 4 September 1994. A [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] was also organized, featuring [[Nanni Balestrini]], [[Paolo Fabbri]], and [[Lamberto Pignotti]]. In 1995 there was a new exhibition about [[Terry Atkinson]].\n\nIn the 1990s the ANS organized frequent cultural events, including the series ''Parola e immagine'' (''Word and Image'', 1990), with Luciano Caramel, Vittorio Fagone, Vanni Scheiwiller, Emilio Tadini and [[Gillo Dorfles]], ''Alfabeto in libert\u00e0'' (''Alphabet in Freedom'', 1991) with [[Cesare Segre]], Tomaso Kemeny, Rossana Bossaglia and [[Tullio Crali]], a conference about [[Ezra Pound]] with Kemeny and Scheiwiller (1993), and a series of meetings about [[Futurism]] featuring Bossaglia, Caramel, Claudia Salaris, Enrico Crispolti, and Anty Pansera (1995).\n\n===The transfer to Mart and Museion===\nAt the end of the 1990s Della Grazia noticed that the preservation and administration of the Archive were becoming too complicated and expensive to be managed by one person. Advised by Francesco Conz, he asked Pier Luigi Siena and Andreas Hapkmeyer of the [[Museion]] of [[Bozen]] to host the collection in their museum. However, the Museion did not have enough space for the entire ANS collection, so Della Grazia decided to involve Gabriella Belli, director of the [[Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto|Mart]] museum of [[Trento]] and [[Rovereto]]. The collection was then split, the Museion kept a larger part of the artworks, and the Mart kept some artworks and the whole archives and library of the ANS. In October 1998 Della Grazia made an agreement with Mart, and in February 1999 the archives and library were moved to the new venue. The ANS archives include, apart from the internal archive of the association, the Fraccaro-Carrega [[fonds]] containing the papers of art collector Marco Fraccaro and visual poet [[Ugo Carrega]].\n\nThe library of the ANS, preserved at the Mart museum, includes more than 10,000 volumes, among them 600 [[artist's book]]s and hundreds of [[Futurism|futurist]] first editions, and 500 art [[magazine]]s including about 100 international artist magazines. It also includes essays about the [[history of writing]], books about [[visual poetry]], [[avant-garde]] magazines, and several rare works of [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], and other artistic movements. For instance, the Mart hosts the ''Libro imbullonato'' (''Bolted Book'') by [[Fortunato Depero]] (1927), ''Chimismi lirici'' (''Lyrical Chemism'') by [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1915), and the ''Litolatte'' by Tullio d'Albisola and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]. The Mart also preserves drawings and graphical artworks by artists such as [[Eugenio Miccini]], Emilio Isgr\u00f2, [[Lamberto Pignotti]], Anna Oberto, Martino Oberto, Vincenzo Ferrari, [[Magdalo Mussio]], Rolando Mignani, Franco Vaccari, Walter Valentini, Alain Arias-Misson, Giuseppe Desiato, Alik Cavaliere, Emilio Tadini, Luca Maria Patella, [[Emilio Villa]], and Giovanna Sandri.\n\nThe ANS collection hosted by the [[Museion]] includes about 2,000 works by exponents of [[concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[visual poetry]], such as [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Terry Atkinson]], Franco Vaccari ([[conceptual art]]), [[Joseph Beuys]], [[John Cage]], [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Ben Vautier]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Robert Watts]] ([[Fluxus]]).\n\n===The 2000s===\nAfter the transfer, Della Grazia continued to organize exhibitions and research. The books and documents hosted by Mart were lent to ''Poesie concrete brasilienne'' (''Brazilian Concrete Poetry''), held in [[Marseille]], [[France]] in 2001,  ''Alfabeto in sogno'' (''Alphabet in Dreams'') in [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Italy]] in 2002, and ''Propaganda, cultura e mito nell'editoria italiana'' (''Propaganda, Culture and Myth in Italian Publishing'') held in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]] in 2004. In the same year the [[artist's book]]s of ANS were lent to ''Deliberatamente. Il libro d'artista negli anni '60 e '70'' (''Deliberately. The Artist Book in the 1960s and 1970s'') in [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]] and to ''Libri taglienti esplosivi luminosi'' (''Sharp Explosive Bright Books''), held in 2005 in [[Trento]] and 2006 in [[Bozen]]. In 2006 they were also shown in [[Bologna]] at the ''Primo amore. La passione di un collezionista'' (''First Love. The Passion of a Collector'') exhibition.\n\nOn 10 November 2007 the Mart opened the ''La parola nell'arte'' (''The Word in Art'') exhibition, organized in collaboration with the [[Museion]] and curated by a committee headed by Giorgio Zanchetti and composed of Gabriella Belli, [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], Andreas Hapkemeyer, Nicoletta Boschiero, Paola Pettenella, Melania Gazzotti, Daniela Ferrari, and Julia Trolp. The exhibition contained more than 800 artworks, both from the Mart and other international collections. On 23 May 2008 the Museion moved to a new building, and director Corinne Diserens curated the exhibition ''Sguardo periferico & corpo collettivo'' (''Peripheral Look & Collective Body''), including works by Gianfranco Baruchello, [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[George Brecht]], [[G\u00fcnter Brus]], [[John Cage]], Calvin Sumsion, Paul de Vree, Jakov Dorfmann, [[John Heartfield]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Arturo Schwarz]], Ugo La Pietra, [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Hermann Nitsch]], Anna Oberto, Claudio Parmiggiani, [[Man Ray]], Sarenco, [[Cy Twombly]], Franco Vaccari, [[Ben Vautier]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]], [[Emmett Williams]].\n\nIn 2013 the Archive started the Verbo Visuale Virtuale project in collaboration with the Bruno Kessler Foundation, with the aim of building a [[digital archive]] of verbo-visual art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dh.fbk.eu/projects/vvv-verbo-visuale-virtuale-la-piattaforma-di-ricerca-interattiva-dellarte-verbo-visuale|title=VVV \u2013 Verbo Visuale Virtuale: la piattaforma di ricerca interattiva dell'arte verbo-visuale|publisher=Bruno Kessler Foundation|accessdate=12 November 2014|language=Italian}}</ref> This project was made possible by a generous grant from the CARITRO Foundation (Trento, Italy).\n\n==Some artists of the ANS collections==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*Vincenzo Accame\n*[[Carla Accardi]]\n*Vincenzo Agnetti\n*Fernando Aguiar\n*[[Rafael Alberti]]\n*Jeremy Alder\n*Maurizio Arcangeli\n*Alain Arias-Misson\n*[[Terry Atkinson]]\n*Filippo Avalle\n*Michael Baldwin\n*[[Nanni Balestrini]]\n*[[Mirell\na Bentivoglio]]\n*[http://www.documentsdartistes.org/artistes/berard/repro.html St\u00e9phane B\u00e9rard]\n[[*Mariella Bettineschi]]\n*[[Remo Bianco]]\n*Tomaso Binga\n*Julien Blaine\n*[[Agostino Bonalumi]]\n*Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bory\n*Antonino Bove\n{{col-break}}\n*[[George Brecht]]\n*[[Joan Brossa]]\n*[[Ugo Carrega]]\n*Luciano Caruso\n*Ugo Castagnotto\n*Alik Cavaliere\n*Mauro Ceolin\n*[[Mario Ceroli]]\n*[[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]]\n*Hsiao Chin\n*[[Henri Chopin]]\n*Luciano Civettini\n*Ken Cox\n*[[Dadamaino]]\n*Herman Damen\n*Betty Danon\n*Angelo de Aquino\n*[[Augusto de Campos]]\n*Paul de Vree\n{{col-break}}\n*Joe Di Donato\n*Corrado D'Ottavi\n*[[Amelia Etlinger]]\n*Vincenzo Ferrari\n*[[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]\n*Carlo Finotti\n*Raffaella Formenti\n*John Furnival\n*Jochen Gerz\n*[[Dick Higgins]]\n*Emilio Isgr\u00f2\n*Francesco La Fosca\n*Liliana Landi\n*Arrigo Lora Totino\n*Stelio Maria Martini\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]\n*Hansjorg Mayer\n*Fausto Melotti\n*Plinio Mesciulam\n*[[Eugenio Miccini]]\n{{col-break}}\n*Rolando Mignani\n*Ottonella Mocellin\n*[[Ignazio Moncada (pittore)|Ignazio Moncada]]\n*Rudolf Mumprecht\n*[[Bruno Munari]]\n*[[Maurizio Nannucci]]\n*[[Hermann Nitsch]]\n*Anna Oberto\n*Martino Oberto\n*Luciano Ori\n*[[Giulio Paolini]]\n*Claudio Parmiggiani\n*Luca Maria Patella\n*[[Nicola Pellegrini]]\n*Michele Perfetti\n*Osvaldo Peruzzi\n*[[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]\n*[[Pablo Picasso]]\n*[[D\u00e9cio Pignatari]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Lamberto Pignotti]]\n*[[Antonio Porta (author)|Antonio Porta]]\n*Luca Quartana\n*Giovanna Sandri\n*Sarenco\n*[[Emilio Scanavino]]\n*Roberto Sanesi\n*Giangiacomo Spadari\n*Adriano Spatola\n*[[Mauro Staccioli]]\n*Shohachiro Takahashi\n*[[Jean Tinguely]]\n*Franco Vaccari\n*Walter Valentini\n*Ji\u0159\u00ed Valoch\n*[[Emilio Villa]]\n*[[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]\n*[[Emmett Williams]]\n*William Xerra\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Exhibitions==\n*''Sei lirici della Poesia Visuale internazionale'' (1990)\n*''Poesia Concreta in Brasile'' (1991)\n*''Martino Oberto (OM)'' (1992)\n*''Linguaggio/immagine'' (1993)\n*''Una colonna un bar una voce'' (1994)\n*''Oggetti di poesia.

It provided the basic facilities of most [[procedural programming]] languages, but more complicated or [[domain-specific language|domain-specific]] features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its [[Profiling (computer programming)|speed]], [[Portability (computer science)|portability]], extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.\n\n== Featur ==\nen as follows:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html | title=Programming in Lua : 1}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n</syntaxhighlight>\nor as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint 'Hello World!'\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA [[comment (computer programming)|comment]] in Lua starts with a double-[[hyphen]] and runs to the end of the line, similar to [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[SQL]] and [[VHDL]]. Multi-line strings and comments are adorned with double square brackets.\n\nThe [[factorial]] function is implemented as a function in this example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction factorial(n)\n  local x = 1\n  for i = 2, n do\n    x = x * i\n  end\n  return x\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Control flow ===\n\nLua has four types of [[loop (computing)|loops]]: the [[while loop|<code>while</code> loop]], the <code>repeat</code> loop (similar to a [[do while loop|<code> do while</code> loop]]), the numeric [[for loop|<code>for</code> loop]], and the generic <code>for</code> loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\n--condition = true\n\nwhile condition do\n  --statements\nend\n\nrepeat\n  --statements\nuntil condition\n\nfor i = first, last, delta do  --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up\n  --statements\n  --example: print(i)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe generic <code>for</code> loop:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfor key, value in pairs(_G) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwould iterate over the table <code>_G</code> using the standard iterator function <code>pairs</code>, until it returns <code>nil</code>.\n\nYou can also do a nested loop, which is a loop inside of another loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal grid = {\n  { 11, 12, 13 },\n  { 21, 22, 23 },\n  { 31, 32, 33 }\n}\n\nfor y, row in ipairs(grid) do\n  for x, value in ipairs(row) do\n    print(x, y, grid[y][x])\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Functions ===\n\nLua's treatment of functions as [[first-class function|first-class]] values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\ndo\n  local oldprint = print\n  -- Store current print function as oldprint\n  function print(s)\n    --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used\n      through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]]\n    oldprint(s == \"foo\" and \"bar\" or s)\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAny future calls to <code>print</code> will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping|lexical scoping]], the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print.\n\nLua also supports [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]], as demonstrated below:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction addto(x)\n  -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument\n  return function(y)\n    --[=[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current\n      scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous\n      function, Lua creates a closure.]=]\n    return x + y\n  end\nend\nfourplus = addto(4)\nprint(fourplus(3))  -- Prints 7\n\n--This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way:\nprint(addto(4)(3))\n--[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly.\n  This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.\n]]\n</syntaxhighlight>\nA new closure for the variable <code>x</code> is created every time <code>addto</code> is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own <code>x</code> parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\n\n=== Tables ===\n\nTables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in [[composite data type]]) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are [[associative array]]s with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax.\n\nA table is a collection of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a [[hash table|hashed]] heterogeneous associative array.\n\nTables are created using the <code>{}</code> constructor syntax.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTables are always passed by reference (see [[Call by sharing]]).\n\nA key (index) can be any value except <code>nil</code> and [[NaN]], including functions.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {x = 10}  -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping \"x\" to the number 10.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10.\nb_table = a_table\nb_table[\"x\"] = 20   -- The value in the table has been changed to 20.\nprint(b_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints 20.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA table is often used as [[object composition|structure]] (or [[Record (computer science)|record]]) by using [[string (computer science)|strings]] as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.3|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2014-02-27|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\npoint = { x = 10, y = 20 }   -- Create new table\nprint(point[\"x\"])            -- Prints 10\nprint(point.x)               -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nPoint = {}\n\nPoint.new = function(x, y)\n  return {x = x, y = y}  --  return {[\"x\"] = x, [\"y\"] = y}\nend\n\nPoint.set_x = function(point, x)\n  point.x = x  --  point[\"x\"] = x;\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an [[array data type]]. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed).\n\nA numeric key <code>1</code> is distinct from a string key <code>\"1\"</code>.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\narray = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" }   -- Indices are assigned automatically.\nprint(array[2])                  -- Prints \"b\". Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1.\nprint(#array)                    -- Prints 4.  # is the length operator for tables and strings.\narray[0] = \"z\"                   -- Zero is a legal index.\nprint(#array)                    -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe length of a table <code>t</code> is defined to be any integer index <code>n</code> such that <code>t[n]</code> is not <code>nil</code> and <code>t[n+1]</code> is <code>nil</code>; moreover, if <code>t[1]</code> is <code>nil</code>, <code>n</code> can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given <code>n</code>, its length is exactly that <code>n</code>, the index of its last value. If the array has \"holes\" (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then <code>#t</code> can be any of the indices that directly precedes a <code>nil</code> value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.5|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2012-10-16|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nExampleTable =\n{\n  {1, 2, 3, 4},\n  {5, 6, 7, 8}\n}\nprint(ExampleTable[1][3]) -- Prints \"3\"\nprint(ExampleTable[2][4]) -- Prints \"8\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA table can be an array of objects.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction Point(x, y)        -- \"Point\" object constructor\n  return { x = x, y = y }   -- Creates and returns a new object (table)\nend\narray = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) }   -- Creates array of points\n                        -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } };\nprint(array[2].y)                                         -- Prints 40\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUsing a hash map to emulate an array normally is slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.<ref name=lobject_h_array>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/source/5.1/lobject.h.html#array|title=Lua 5.1 Source Code|accessdate=2011-03-24|year=2006}}</ref><!-- I'd like to find a message on the mailing list from one of the developers, but I can't. Oh well, source code is a pretty trustworthy reference. -->\n\n=== Metatables ===\nExtensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the [[metatable]] concept allows Lua's tables to be customized in powerful ways.  The following example demonstrates an \"infinite\" table.  For any <code>n</code>, <code>fibs[n]</code> will give the <code>n</code>-th [[Fibonacci number]] using [[dynamic programming]] and [[memoization]].\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfibs = { 1, 1 }                                -- Initial values for fibs[1] and fibs[2].\nsetmetatable(fibs, {\n  __index = function(values, n)                --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, \n                                                   it is called if key \"n\" does not exist.]]\n    values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2]  -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n].\n    return values[n]\n  end\n})\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Object-oriented programming ===\n\nAlthough Lua does not have a built-in concept of [[class (computer science)|classes]], [[object-oriented programming]] can be achieved using two language features: [[first-class function]]s and tables. By placing functions and related data into a table, an object is formed. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] (both single and multiple) can be implemented using the [[metatable]] mechanism, telling the object to look up nonexistent methods and fields in parent object(s).\n\nThere is no such concept as \"class\" with these techniques; rather, [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]] are used, similar to [[Self (programming language)|Self]] or [[JavaScript]]. New objects are created either with a [[factory method pattern|factory method]] (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object.\n\nLua provides some [[syntactic sugar]] to facilitate object orientation. To declare [[Method (computer science)|member functions]] inside a prototype table, one can use {{code |lang=lua |function table:func(args)}}, which is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |function table.func(self, args)}}. Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: {{code |lang=lua |object:func(args)}} is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |object.func(object, args)}}.\n\nCreating a basic [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] object:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal Vector = {}\nVector.__index = Vector\n\nfunction Vector:new(x, y, z)    -- The constructor\n  return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, Vector)\nend\n\nfunction Vector:magnitude()     -- Another method\n  -- Reference the implicit object using self\n  return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)\nend\n\nlocal vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector\nprint(vec:magnitude())          -- Call a method (output: 1)\nprint(vec.x)                    -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nLua programs are not [[interpreted language|interpreted]] directly from the textual Lua file, but are [[compiler|compiled]] into [[bytecode]], which is then run on the Lua [[virtual machine]]. The compilation process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]], but it can be done offline in order to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the <code>dump</code> function from the string library and the <code>load/loadstring/loadfile</code> functions.

The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library.<ref name=\"luarefman\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/| title = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2012-10-23}}</ref> The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual [[Reference counting|reference management]] in C code, unlike [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s API. The API, like the language, is minimalistic. Advanced functionality is provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of [[preprocessor]] [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] which assist with complex table operations.\n\nThe Lua C API is [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, as well as functions for manipulating tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, \u22121<!-- not a hyphen --> is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). [[Marshalling (computer science)|Marshalling]] data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the <code>lua_call</code> is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack.\n\nHere is an example of calling a Lua function from C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*)\n#include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*)\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // create a Lua state\n    lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();\n\n    // load and execute a string\n    if (luaL_dostring(L, \"function foo (x,y) return x+y end\")) {\n        lua_close(L);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // push value of global \"foo\" (the function defined above)\n    // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3\n    lua_getglobal(L, \"foo\");\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 5);\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 3);\n    lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value\n    printf(\"Result: %d\\n\", lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top\n    lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state\n    lua_close(L); // close Lua state\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nRunning this example gives:\n<pre>$ cc -o example example.c -llua\n$ ./example\nResult: 8\n</pre>\n\nThe C API also provides some special tables, located at various \"pseudo-indices\" in the Lua stack. At <code>LUA_GLOBALSINDEX</code> prior to Lua 5.2<ref name=\"Changes in the API, Lua 5.2 manual\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#8.3| title = Changes in the API | work = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2014-05-09}}</ref> is the globals table, <code>_G</code> from within Lua, which is the main [[namespace]]. There is also a registry located at <code>LUA_REGISTRYINDEX</code> where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\n\nIt is possible to write extension modules using the Lua API. Extension modules are [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|shared objects]] which can be used to extend the functionality of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. From the Lua side, such a module appears as a namespace table holding its functions and variables. Lua scripts may load extension modules using <code>require</code>,<ref name=luarefman /> just like modules written in Lua itself. A growing collection of modules known as ''rocks'' are available through a [[package management system]] called [[LuaRocks]],<ref>{{cite web| url = https://luarocks.org/| title = LuaRocks| publisher = LuaRocks wiki| accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> in the spirit of [[CPAN]], [[RubyGems]] and [[Python eggs]].

As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its [[Profiling (computer programming)|speed]], [[Portability (computer science)|portability]], extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.\n\n== History ==\n\nLua was created in 1993 by [[Roberto Ierusalimschy]], Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Brazil]].\n\nFrom 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong [[trade barrier]]s (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software. In that atmosphere, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch.<ref name=hopl2007>{{cite book| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R.| author1-link = Roberto Ierusalimschy| last2 = Figueiredo| first2 = L.

There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them.\n\nIn ''The Evolution of Lua'', the language's authors wrote:<ref name=hopl2007 />\n\n{{Quote|In 1993, the only real contender was [[Tcl]], which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] or [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] because of their unfriendly syntax. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language&nbsp;... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API.}}\n\nLua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: ''Sol'' is also the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese word]] for \"Sun\", ''Lua'' being the word for \"Moon\"). Lua [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] for control structures was mostly borrowed from [[Modula]] (<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>repeat</code>/<code>until</code>), but also had taken influence from [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to [[Call by reference|reference parameters]] or explicit [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]), [[C++]] (\"neat idea of allowing a [[local variable]] to be declared only where we need it\"<ref name=hopl2007 />), [[SNOBOL]] and [[AWK]] ([[associative array]]s). In an article published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', Lua's creators also state that [[LISP]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the [[List (computing)|list]]) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua.<ref name=ddj96>{{cite news| last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = L.

A few metamechanisms replace a host of features| magazine = Dr. Dobb's Journal| volume = 21| issue = 12| pages = 26\u201333| date = December 1996| url = https://www.lua.org/ddj.html}}</ref>\n\nLua [[semantics]] have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time,<ref name=hopl2007 /> especially with the introduction of [[anonymous function]]s and full [[Scope (computer science)#Lexical scope vs. dynamic scope|lexical scoping]]. Several features were added in new Lua versions.\n\nVersions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the [[MIT License]].  Both are [[permissive free software licences]] and are almost identical.\n\n== Features ==\n{{excessive detail|section|date=April 2017}}\n\nLua is commonly described as a \"[[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]]\" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], but allows it to be implemented with [[metatable]]s. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement [[namespaces]], [[Class (computer science)|classes]], and other related features using its single table implementation; [[first-class function]]s allow the employment of many techniques from [[functional programming]]; and full lexical [[Scope (programming)|scoping]] allows fine-grained [[information hiding]] to enforce the [[principle of least privilege]].\n\nIn general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible [[Metaprogramming|meta-features]] that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is [[Lightweight programming language|light]]\u2014the full reference [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] is only about 247&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] compiled<ref name=luaabout />\u2014and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications.\n\nLua is a [[dynamically typed]] language intended for use as an [[Scripting language|extension]] or [[scripting language]] and is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, numbers (double-precision [[floating point]] and 64-bit [[integers]] by default), and [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Typical data structures such as [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[set (computer science)|sets]], [[List (computing)|lists]], and [[record (computer science)|records]] can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous [[associative array]].\n\nLua implements a small set of advanced features such as [[first-class function]]s, [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], proper [[Tail recursion|tail calls]], [[Type conversion|coercion]] (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), [[coroutine]]s (cooperative multitasking) and [[Dynamic loading|dynamic module loading]].\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\nThe classic [[\"Hello, World!\" program]] can be written as follows:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html | title=Programming in Lua : 1}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n</syntaxhighlight>\nor as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint 'Hello World!'\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA [[comment (computer programming)|comment]] in Lua starts with a double-[[hyphen]] and runs to the end of the line, similar to [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[SQL]] and [[VHDL]]. Multi-line strings and comments are adorned with double square brackets.\n\nThe [[factorial]] function is implemented as a function in this example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction factorial(n)\n  local x = 1\n  for i = 2, n do\n    x = x * i\n  end\n  return x\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Control flow ===\n\nLua has four types of [[loop (computing)|loops]]: the [[while loop|<code>while</code> loop]], the <code>repeat</code> loop (similar to a [[do while loop|<code> do while</code> loop]]), the numeric [[for loop|<code>for</code> loop]], and the generic <code>for</code> loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\n--condition = true\n\nwhile condition do\n  --statements\nend\n\nrepeat\n  --statements\nuntil condition\n\nfor i = first, last, delta do  --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up\n  --statements\n  --example: print(i)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe generic <code>for</code> loop:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfor key, value in pairs(_G) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwould iterate over the table <code>_G</code> using the standard iterator function <code>pairs</code>, until it returns <code>nil</code>.\n\nYou can also do a nested loop, which is a loop inside of another loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal grid = {\n  { 11, 12, 13 },\n  { 21, 22, 23 },\n  { 31, 32, 33 }\n}\n\nfor y, row in ipairs(grid) do\n  for x, value in ipairs(row) do\n    print(x, y, grid[y][x])\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Functions ===\n\nLua's treatment of functions as [[first-class function|first-class]] values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\ndo\n  local oldprint = print\n  -- Store current print function as oldprint\n  function print(s)\n    --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used\n      through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]]\n    oldprint(s == \"foo\" and \"bar\" or s)\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAny future calls to <code>print</code> will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping|lexical scoping]], the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print.\n\nLua also supports [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]], as demonstrated below:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction addto(x)\n  -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument\n  return function(y)\n    --[=[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current\n      scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous\n      function, Lua creates a closure.]=]\n    return x + y\n  end\nend\nfourplus = addto(4)\nprint(fourplus(3))  -- Prints 7\n\n--This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way:\nprint(addto(4)(3))\n--[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly.\n  This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.\n]]\n</syntaxhighlight>\nA new closure for the variable <code>x</code> is created every time <code>addto</code> is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own <code>x</code> parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\n\n=== Tables ===\n\nTables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in [[composite data type]]) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are [[associative array]]s with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax.\n\nA table is a collection of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a [[hash table|hashed]] heterogeneous associative array.\n\nTables are created using the <code>{}</code> constructor syntax.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTables are always passed by reference (see [[Call by sharing]]).\n\nA key (index) can be any value except <code>nil</code> and [[NaN]], including functions.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {x = 10}  -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping \"x\" to the number 10.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10.\nb_table = a_table\nb_table[\"x\"] = 20   -- The value in the table has been changed to 20.\nprint(b_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints 20.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA table is often used as [[object composition|structure]] (or [[Record (computer science)|record]]) by using [[string (computer science)|strings]] as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.3|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2014-02-27|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\npoint = { x = 10, y = 20 }   -- Create new table\nprint(point[\"x\"])            -- Prints 10\nprint(point.x)               -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nPoint = {}\n\nPoint.new = function(x, y)\n  return {x = x, y = y}  --  return {[\"x\"] = x, [\"y\"] = y}\nend\n\nPoint.set_x = function(point, x)\n  point.x = x  --  point[\"x\"] = x;\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an [[array data type]]. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed).\n\nA numeric key <code>1</code> is distinct from a string key <code>\"1\"</code>.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\narray = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" }   -- Indices are assigned automatically.\nprint(array[2])                  -- Prints \"b\". Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1.\nprint(#array)                    -- Prints 4.  # is the length operator for tables and strings.\narray[0] = \"z\"                   -- Zero is a legal index.\nprint(#array)                    -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe length of a table <code>t</code> is defined to be any integer index <code>n</code> such that <code>t[n]</code> is not <code>nil</code> and <code>t[n+1]</code> is <code>nil</code>; moreover, if <code>t[1]</code> is <code>nil</code>, <code>n</code> can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given <code>n</code>, its length is exactly that <code>n</code>, the index of its last value. If the array has \"holes\" (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then <code>#t</code> can be any of the indices that directly precedes a <code>nil</code> value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.5|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2012-10-16|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nExampleTable =\n{\n  {1, 2, 3, 4},\n  {5, 6, 7, 8}\n}\nprint(ExampleTable[1][3]) -- Prints \"3\"\nprint(ExampleTable[2][4]) -- Prints \"8\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA table can be an array of objects.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction Point(x, y)        -- \"Point\" object constructor\n  return { x = x, y = y }   -- Creates and returns a new object (table)\nend\narray = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) }   -- Creates array of points\n                        -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } };\nprint(array[2].y)                                         -- Prints 40\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUsing a hash map to emulate an array normally is slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.<ref name=lobject_h_array>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/source/5.1/lobject.h.html#array|title=Lua 5.1 Source Code|accessdate=2011-03-24|year=2006}}</ref><!-- I'd like to find a message on the mailing list from one of the developers, but I can't. Oh well, source code is a pretty trustworthy reference. -->\n\n=== Metatables ===\nExtensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the [[metatable]] concept allows Lua's tables to be customized in powerful ways.  The following example demonstrates an \"infinite\" table.  For any <code>n</code>, <code>fibs[n]</code> will give the <code>n</code>-th [[Fibonacci number]] using [[dynamic programming]] and [[memoization]].\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfibs = { 1, 1 }                                -- Initial values for fibs[1] and fibs[2].\nsetmetatable(fibs, {\n  __index = function(values, n)                --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, \n                                                   it is called if key \"n\" does not exist.]]\n    values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2]  -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n].\n    return values[n]\n  end\n})\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Object-oriented programming ===\n\nAlthough Lua does not have a built-in concept of [[class (computer science)|classes]], [[object-oriented programming]] can be achieved using two language features: [[first-class function]]s and tables. By placing functions and related data into a table, an object is formed. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] (both single and multiple) can be implemented using the [[metatable]] mechanism, telling the object to look up nonexistent methods and fields in parent object(s).\n\nThere is no such concept as \"class\" with these techniques; rather, [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]] are used, similar to [[Self (programming language)|Self]] or [[JavaScript]]. New objects are created either with a [[factory method pattern|factory method]] (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object.\n\nLua provides some [[syntactic sugar]] to facilitate object orientation. To declare [[Method (computer science)|member functions]] inside a prototype table, one can use {{code |lang=lua |function table:func(args)}}, which is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |function table.func(self, args)}}. Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: {{code |lang=lua |object:func(args)}} is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |object.func(object, args)}}.\n\nCreating a basic [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] object:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal Vector = {}\nVector.__index = Vector\n\nfunction Vector:new(x, y, z)    -- The constructor\n  return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, Vector)\nend\n\nfunction Vector:magnitude()     -- Another method\n  -- Reference the implicit object using self\n  return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)\nend\n\nlocal vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector\nprint(vec:magnitude())          -- Call a method (output: 1)\nprint(vec.x)                    -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nLua programs are not [[interpreted language|interpreted]] directly from the textual Lua file, but are [[compiler|compiled]] into [[bytecode]], which is then run on the Lua [[virtual machine]]. The compilation process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]], but it can be done offline in order to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the <code>dump</code> function from the string library and the <code>load/loadstring/loadfile</code> functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code.<ref name=\"luaspe\" /><ref name=\"luaabout\" />\n\nLike most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are [[stack machine|stack-based]]), the Lua VM is [[register machine|register-based]], and therefore more closely resembles an actual hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use.<ref name=lua5impl>{{cite journal| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R. | last2 = Figueiredo | first2 = L.

The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library.<ref name=\"luarefman\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/| title = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2012-10-23}}</ref> The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual [[Reference counting|reference management]] in C code, unlike [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s API. The API, like the language, is minimalistic. Advanced functionality is provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of [[preprocessor]] [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] which assist with complex table operations.\n\nThe Lua C API is [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, as well as functions for manipulating tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, \u22121<!-- not a hyphen --> is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). [[Marshalling (computer science)|Marshalling]] data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the <code>lua_call</code> is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack.\n\nHere is an example of calling a Lua function from C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*)\n#include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*)\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // create a Lua state\n    lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();\n\n    // load and execute a string\n    if (luaL_dostring(L, \"function foo (x,y) return x+y end\")) {\n        lua_close(L);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // push value of global \"foo\" (the function defined above)\n    // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3\n    lua_getglobal(L, \"foo\");\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 5);\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 3);\n    lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value\n    printf(\"Result: %d\\n\", lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top\n    lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state\n    lua_close(L); // close Lua state\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nRunning this example gives:\n<pre>$ cc -o example example.c -llua\n$ ./example\nResult: 8\n</pre>\n\nThe C API also provides some special tables, located at various \"pseudo-indices\" in the Lua stack. At <code>LUA_GLOBALSINDEX</code> prior to Lua 5.2<ref name=\"Changes in the API, Lua 5.2 manual\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#8.3| title = Changes in the API | work = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2014-05-09}}</ref> is the globals table, <code>_G</code> from within Lua, which is the main [[namespace]]. There is also a registry located at <code>LUA_REGISTRYINDEX</code> where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\n\nIt is possible to write extension modules using the Lua API. Extension modules are [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|shared objects]] which can be used to extend the functionality of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. From the Lua side, such a module appears as a namespace table holding its functions and variables. Lua scripts may load extension modules using <code>require</code>,<ref name=luarefman /> just like modules written in Lua itself.
