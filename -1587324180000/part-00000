{"title_page": "Expected value", "text_new": "{{About|the term used in probability theory and statistics}}\n{{redirect|E(X)|the <math>e^x</math> function|Exponential function}}\n\n'''Expected value''' of a [[random variable]] is a basic concept of [[probability theory]]. The expected value is also known as the '''expectation''', '''mathematical expectation''', '''mean''', '''average''', or '''first moment'''.\n\nThe expected value of a constant random variable <math>X = c</math> is <math>c</math>. The expected value of a random variable <math>X</math> with ''equiprobable'' [[outcome (probability)|outcomes]] <math>\\{c_1,\\ldots,c_n\\}</math> is the [[arithmetic mean]] of the terms <math>c_i.</math> If some of the probabilities <math>\\Pr\\,(X=c_i)</math> of an individual outcome <math>c_i</math> are unequal, then the expected value is the [[Weighted average|probability-weighted average]] of the <math>c_i</math>s, i.e. the sum of the <math>n</math> products <math>c_i\\cdot \\Pr\\,(X=c_i)</math>.\n\nExtending the notion of probability-weighted average to arbitrary random variables <math>X,</math> the expected value of <math>X</math> is defined as [[Lebesgue integral]] of <math>X</math> over the [[sample space]], relative to the [[probability measure]].\n\nIntuitively, expected value is the mean of a large number of independent realizations of the random variable.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe idea of the expected value originated in the middle of the 17th century from the study of the so-called [[problem of points]], which seeks to divide the stakes ''in a fair way'' between two players who have to end their game before it's properly finished.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750|language=en|doi=10.1002/0471725161|series = Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics|year = 1990|isbn = 9780471725169}}</ref> This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to [[Blaise Pascal]] by French writer and amateur mathematician [[Antoine Gombaud|Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9]]. M\u00e9r\u00e9 claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively; however, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ore, Pascal and the Invention of Probability Theory |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=67 |issue=5 |year=1960 |pages=409\u2013419 |doi=10.2307/2309286|jstor=2309286 |last1=Ore |first1=Oystein }}</ref>\n\nThree years later, in 1657, a Dutch mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]], who had just visited Paris, published a treatise (see {{harvtxt|Huygens|1657}}) \"''De ratiociniis in ludo ale\u00e6''\" on probability theory. In this book he considered the problem of points and presented a solution based on the same principle as the solutions of Pascal and Fermat. Huygens also extended the concept of expectation by adding rules for how to calculate expectations in more complicated situations than the original problem (e.g., for three or more players). In this sense this book can be seen as the first successful attempt at laying down the foundations of the [[theory of probability]].\n\nIn the foreword to his book, Huygens wrote:\n\n{{Quote|text=It should be said, also, that for some time some of the best mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for me for this reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally I have found that my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs.|sign=|source=Edwards (2002)}}\n\nThus, Huygens learned about [[de M\u00e9r\u00e9's Problem]] in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascal's; so that before his book went to press in 1657 he knew about Pascal's priority in this subject.\n\n===Etymology===\nNeither Pascal nor Huygens used the term \"expectation\" in its modern sense. In particular, Huygens writes:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/huygens/huygens.pdf|title=The Value of Chances in Games of Fortune.

This division is the only equitable one when all strange circumstances are eliminated; because an equal degree of probability gives an equal right for the sum hoped for. We will call this advantage ''mathematical hope''.}}\n\n==Notations==\nThe use of the letter <math>\\mathop{\\hbox{E}}</math> to denote expected value goes back to [[William Allen Whitworth|W. A. Whitworth]] in 1901<ref>Whitworth, W.A. (1901) ''Choice and Chance with One Thousand Exercises''. Fifth edition. Deighton Bell, Cambridge. [Reprinted by Hafner Publishing Co., New York, 1959.]</ref>. The symbol has become popular since for English writers.  In German, <math>\\mathop{\\hbox{E}}</math> stands for \"Erwartungswert\", in Spanish for \"Esperanza matem\u00e1tica\", and in French for \"Esp\u00e9rance math\u00e9matique\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Earliest uses of symbols in probability and statistics|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/stat.html}}</ref>.\n\nAnother popular notation is <math>\\mu_X</math>, where as <math>\\langle X\\rangle</math> is commonly used in physics, and <math>\\mathop{\\hbox{M}}(X)</math> in Russian-language literature.\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Finite case===\nLet <math>X</math> be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k</math> occurring with probabilities <math>p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k,</math> respectively. The '''expectation''' of <math>X</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] =\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\\,p_i=x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \\cdots + x_kp_k.</math>\n\nSince the sum of all probabilities <math>p_i</math> is 1 (<math>p_1 + p_2 + \\cdots + p_k = 1</math>), the expected value is the [[weighted average]] of the <math>x_i</math> values, with the <math>p_i</math> values being the weights.\n\nIf all outcomes <math>x_i</math> are [[equiprobable]] (that is, <math>p_1 = p_2 = \\cdots = p_k</math>), then the weighted average turns into the simple [[arithmetic mean|average]]. If the outcomes <math>x_i</math> are not equiprobable, then the simple average must be replaced with the weighted average, which takes into account the fact that some outcomes are more likely than the others.\n\n[[File:Largenumbers.svg|An illustration of the convergence of sequence averages of rolls of a {{dice}} to the expected value of 3.5 as the number of rolls (trials) grows.|thumb|right|400 px]]\n\n====Examples====\n*Let <math>X</math> represent the outcome of a roll of a fair six-sided {{dice}}. More specifically, <math>X</math> will be the number of [[Pip (counting)|pips]] showing on the top face of the {{dice}} after the toss. The possible values for <math>X</math> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all of which are equally likely with a probability of {{frac2|1|6}}. The expectation of <math>X</math> is\n:: <math>\\operatorname{E}[X] = 1\\cdot\\frac16 + 2\\cdot\\frac16 + 3\\cdot\\frac16 + 4\\cdot\\frac16 + 5\\cdot\\frac16 + 6\\cdot\\frac16 = 3.5.</math>\n\n:If one rolls the {{dice}} <math>n</math> times and computes the average ([[arithmetic mean]]) of the results, then as <math>n</math> grows, the average will [[almost surely]] [[Convergent sequence|converge]] to the expected value, a fact known as the [[strong law of large numbers]].\n\n*The [[roulette]] game consists of a small ball and a wheel with 38 numbered pockets around the edge. As the wheel is spun, the ball bounces around randomly until it settles down in one of the pockets. Suppose random variable <math>X</math> represents the (monetary) outcome of a $1 bet on a single number (\"straight up\" bet). If the bet wins (which happens with probability {{frac2|1|38}} in American roulette), the payoff is $35; otherwise the player loses the bet. The expected profit from such a bet will be\n:: <math>   \\operatorname{E}[\\,\\text{gain from }\\$1\\text{ bet}\\,] = -\\$1 \\cdot \\frac{37}{38} + \\$35 \\cdot \\frac{1}{38} = -\\$\\frac{1}{19}.</math>\n\n:That is, the bet of $1 stands to lose <math>-\\$\\frac{1}{19}</math>, so its expected value is <math>-\\$\\frac{1}{19}.</math>\n\n===Countably infinite case===\nIntuitively, the expectation of a random variable taking values in a countable set of outcomes is defined analogously as the weighted sum of the outcome values, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of realizing that value. However, convergence issues associated with the infinite sum necessitate a more careful definition. A rigorous definition first defines expectation of a non-negative random variable, and then adapts it to general random variables.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a non-negative random variable with a countable set of outcomes <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots,</math> occurring with probabilities <math>p_1, p_2, \\ldots,</math> respectively. Analogous to the discrete case, the expected value of <math>X</math> is then defined as the series\n: <math>    \\operatorname{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i\\, p_i.</math>\nNote that since <math>x_i p_i \\geq 0</math>, the infinite sum is well-defined and does not depend on the [[absolute convergence|order]] in which it is computed. Unlike the discrete case, the expectation here can be equal to infinity, if the infinite sum above increases without bound.\n\n====Examples====\n\n*Suppose <math>x_i = i</math> and <math> p_i = \\frac{k}{i2^i},</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots</math>, where <math>k = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}</math> (with <math>\\ln</math> being the [[natural logarithm]]) is the scale factor such that the probabilities sum to 1. Then, using the direct definition for non-negative random variables, we have\n::<math>\\operatorname{E}[X]= \\sum_i x_i p_i = 1\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{k}{8}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{k}{24}\\right) + \\dots = \\frac{k}{2}+\\frac{k}{4}+\\frac{k}{8}+\\dots = k.</math>\n\n*An example where the expectation is infinite arises in the context of the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]. Let <math>x_i=2^i</math> and <math>p_i=\\frac{1}{2^i}</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots</math>. Once again, since the random variable is non-negative, the expected value calculation gives\n::<math> \\operatorname{E}[X]= \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i\\,p_i  =2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}+4\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} + 8\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+ 16\\cdot\\frac{1}{16}+ \\cdots = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \\cdots  \\, = \\infty. </math>\n\n*For an example where the expectation is not well-defined, suppose the random variable <math>X</math> takes values 1, \u22122, 3, \u22124, ..., with respective probabilities <math>\\frac{c}{1^2},\\frac{c}{2^2},\\frac{c}{3^2},\\frac{c}{4^2}</math>, ..., where <math>c=\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}</math> is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum up to one. \n:Define <math>X^+(\\omega)=\\max(X(\\omega),0)</math> and <math>X^-(\\omega)=-\\min(X(\\omega),0)</math>. It follows that <math>X^+</math> takes value <math>2k-1</math> with probability <math>c/(2k-1)^2</math> for <math> k = 1,2,3,\\cdots</math> and takes value <math>0</math> with remaining probability. Similarly, <math>X^-</math> takes value <math>2k</math> with probability <math>c/(2k)^2</math> for <math> k = 1,2,3,\\cdots</math> and takes value <math>0</math> with remaining probability. Using the definition for non-negative random variables, one can show that both <math>\\operatorname{E}[X^+] = \\infty </math> and <math>\\operatorname{E}[X^-] = \\infty </math> (see [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Harmonic series]]). Hence, the expectation of <math>X</math> is not well-defined.\n\n===Absolutely continuous case===\nIf <math>X</math> is a random variable whose [[cumulative distribution function]] admits a [[probability density function|density]] <math>f(x)</math>, then the expected value is defined as the [[Lebesgue integral]]\n: <math>    \\operatorname{E}[X] = \\int_{\\R} x f(x)\\, dx,</math>\nwhere the values on both sides are well defined or not well defined simultaneously.\n\n'''Example.'''

In particular, for a random variable <math>X</math> with well-defined expectation, <math>\\operatorname{E}[\\operatorname{E}[X]]=\\operatorname{E}[X]</math>. A well defined expectation implies that there is one number, or rather, one constant that defines the expected value. Thus follows that the expectation of this constant is just the original expected value.\n*\n\n== Uses and applications ==\nThe expectation of a random variable plays an important role in a variety of contexts. For example, in [[decision theory]], an agent making an optimal choice in the context of incomplete information is often assumed to maximize the expected value of their [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility function|utility function]].\nFor a different example, in [[statistics]], where one seeks estimates for unknown parameters based on available data, the estimate itself is a random variable. In such settings, a desirable criterion for a \"good\" estimator is that it is [[unbiased estimator|unbiased]] \u2013 that is, the expected value of the estimate is equal to the true value of the underlying parameter.\n\nIt is possible to construct an expected value equal to the probability of an event by taking the expectation of an [[indicator function]] that is one if the event has occurred and zero otherwise. This relationship can be used to translate properties of expected values into properties of probabilities, e.g. using the law of large numbers to justify estimating probabilities by [[Statistical frequency|frequencies]].\n\nThe expected values of the powers of ''X'' are called the [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of ''X''; the [[moment about the mean|moments about the mean]] of ''X'' are expected values of powers of ''X'' \u2212 E[''X'']. The moments of some random variables can be used to specify their distributions, via their [[moment generating function]]s.\n\nTo empirically [[Estimation theory|estimate]] the expected value of a random variable, one repeatedly measures observations of the variable and computes the [[arithmetic mean]] of the results. If the expected value exists, this procedure estimates the true expected value in an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] manner and has the property of minimizing the sum of the squares of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (the sum of the squared differences between the observations and the [[estimator|estimate]]). The [[law of large numbers]] demonstrates (under fairly mild conditions) that, as the [[Sample size|size]] of the [[statistical sample|sample]] gets larger, the [[variance]] of this [[estimator|estimate]] gets smaller.\n\nThis property is often exploited in a wide variety of applications, including general problems of [[statistical estimation]] and [[machine learning]], to estimate (probabilistic) quantities of interest via [[Monte Carlo methods]], since most quantities of interest can be written in terms of expectation, e.g. <math>\\operatorname{P}({X \\in \\mathcal{A}}) = \\operatorname{E}[{\\mathbf 1}_{\\mathcal{A}}]</math>, where <math> {\\mathbf 1}_{\\mathcal{A}}</math> is the indicator function of the set <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.\n\n[[File:Beta first moment.svg|thumb|The mass of probability distribution is balanced at the expected value, here a Beta(\u03b1,\u03b2) distribution with expected value \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2).]] In [[classical mechanics]], the [[center of mass]] is an analogous concept to expectation. For example, suppose ''X'' is a discrete random variable with values ''x<sub>i</sub>'' and corresponding probabilities ''p<sub>i</sub>''. Now consider a weightless rod on which are placed weights, at locations ''x<sub>i</sub>'' along the rod and having masses ''p<sub>i</sub>'' (whose sum is one). The point at which the rod balances is E[''X''].\n\nExpected values can also be used to compute the [[variance]], by means of the computational formula for the variance\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X)=  \\operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\\operatorname{E}[X])^2.</math>\n\nA very important application of the expectation value is in the field of [[quantum mechanics]]. The expectation value of a quantum mechanical operator <math>\\hat{A}</math> operating on a [[quantum state]] vector <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is written as <math>\\langle\\hat{A}\\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle</math>. The [[uncertainty principle|uncertainty]] in <math>\\hat{A}</math> can be calculated using the formula <math>(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle\\hat{A}^2\\rangle - \\langle \\hat{A} \\rangle^2 </math>.\n\n==== Interchanging limits and expectation ====\nIn general, it is not the case that <math>\\operatorname{E}[X_n] \\to \\operatorname{E}[X]</math> despite <math>X_n\\to X</math> pointwise. Thus, one cannot interchange limits and expectation, without additional conditions on the random variables. To see this, let <math>U</math> be a random variable distributed uniformly on <math>[0,1]</math>. For <math>n\\geq 1,</math> define a sequence of random variables\n\n:<math>\nX_n = n \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\left\\{ U \\in  \\left[0,\\tfrac{1}{n}\\right]\\right\\},\n</math>\n\nwith <math>{\\mathbf 1}\\{A\\}</math> being the indicator function of the event <math>A</math>. Then, it follows that <math>X_n \\to 0</math> (a.s). But, <math>\\operatorname{E}[X_n] = n \\cdot \\operatorname{P}\\left(U \\in \\left[ 0, \\tfrac{1}{n}\\right] \\right) = n \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{n} = 1</math> for each <math>n</math>. Hence, <math> \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\operatorname{E}[X_n] = 1 \\neq 0 = \\operatorname{E}\\left[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} X_n \\right].</math>\n\nAnalogously, for general sequence of random variables <math>\\{ Y_n : n \\geq 0\\}</math>, the expected value operator is not <math>\\sigma</math>-additive, i.e.\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{E}\\left[\\sum^\\infty_{n=0} Y_n\\right] \\neq \\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\operatorname{E}[Y_n].\n</math>\n\nAn example is easily obtained by setting <math>Y_0 = X_1</math> and <math>Y_n = X_{n+1} - X_n</math> for <math>n \\geq 1</math>, where <math>X_n</math> is as in the previous example.\n\nA number of convergence results specify exact conditions which allow one to interchange limits and expectations, as specified below.\n\n*[[Monotone convergence theorem]]: Let <math>\\{X_n : n \\geq 0\\}</math> be a sequence of random variables, with <math>0 \\leq X_n \\leq X_{n+1}</math> (a.s) for each <math> n \\geq 0</math>.

Then, the monotone convergence theorem states that <math>\\lim_n\\operatorname{E}[X_n]=\\operatorname{E}[X].</math>\n\n:Using the monotone convergence theorem, one can show that expectation indeed satisfies countable additivity for non-negative random variables.

M\u00e9r\u00e9 claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively; however, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ore, Pascal and the Invention of Probability Theory |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=67 |issue=5 |year=1960 |pages=409\u2013419 |doi=10.2307/2309286|jstor=2309286 |last1=Ore |first1=Oystein }}</ref>\n\nThree years later, in 1657, a Dutch mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]], who had just visited Paris, published a treatise (see {{harvtxt|Huygens|1657}}) \"''De ratiociniis in ludo ale\u00e6''\" on probability theory. In this book he considered the problem of points and presented a solution based on the same principle as the solutions of Pascal and Fermat. Huygens also extended the concept of expectation by adding rules for how to calculate expectations in more complicated situations than the original problem (e.g., for three or more players). In this sense this book can be seen as the first successful attempt at laying down the foundations of the [[theory of probability]].\n\nIn the foreword to his book, Huygens wrote:\n\n{{Quote|text=It should be said, also, that for some time some of the best mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for me for this reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally I have found that my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs.|sign=|source=Edwards (2002)}}\n\nThus, Huygens learned about [[de M\u00e9r\u00e9's Problem]] in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascal's; so that before his book went to press in 1657 he knew about Pascal's priority in this subject.\n\n===Etymology===\nNeither Pascal nor Huygens used the term \"expectation\" in its modern sense. In particular, Huygens writes:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/huygens/huygens.pdf|title=The Value of Chances in Games of Fortune.

We will call this advantage ''mathematical hope''.}}\n\n==Notations==\nThe use of the letter <math>\\mathop{\\hbox{E}}</math> to denote expected value goes back to [[William Allen Whitworth|W. A. Whitworth]] in 1901<ref>Whitworth, W.A. (1901) ''Choice and Chance with One Thousand Exercises''. Fifth edition. Deighton Bell, Cambridge. [Reprinted by Hafner Publishing Co., New York, 1959.]</ref>. The symbol has become popular since for English writers.  In German, <math>\\mathop{\\hbox{E}}</math> stands for \"Erwartungswert\", in Spanish for \"Esperanza matem\u00e1tica\", and in French for \"Esp\u00e9rance math\u00e9matique\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Earliest uses of symbols in probability and statistics|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/stat.html}}</ref>.\n\nAnother popular notation is <math>\\mu_X</math>, where as <math>\\langle X\\rangle</math> is commonly used in physics, and <math>\\mathop{\\hbox{M}}(X)</math> in Russian-language literature.\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Finite case===\nLet <math>X</math> be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k</math> occurring with probabilities <math>p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k,</math> respectively. The '''expectation''' of <math>X</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] =\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\\,p_i=x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \\cdots + x_kp_k.</math>\n\nSince the sum of all probabilities <math>p_i</math> is 1 (<math>p_1 + p_2 + \\cdots + p_k = 1</math>), the expected value is the [[weighted average]] of the <math>x_i</math> values, with the <math>p_i</math> values being the weights.\n\nIf all outcomes <math>x_i</math> are [[equiprobable]] (that is, <math>p_1 = p_2 = \\cdots = p_k</math>), then the weighted average turns into the simple [[arithmetic mean|average]]. If the outcomes <math>x_i</math> are not equiprobable, then the simple average must be replaced with the weighted average, which takes into account the fact that some outcomes are more likely than the others.\n\n[[File:Largenumbers.svg|An illustration of the convergence of sequence averages of rolls of a {{dice}} to the expected value of 3.5 as the number of rolls (trials) grows.|thumb|right|400 px]]\n\n====Examples====\n*Let <math>X</math> represent the outcome of a roll of a fair six-sided {{dice}}.

The possible values for <math>X</math> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all of which are equally likely with a probability of {{frac2|1|6}}.

As the wheel is spun, the ball bounces around randomly until it settles down in one of the pockets. Suppose random variable <math>X</math> represents the (monetary) outcome of a $1 bet on a single number (\"straight up\" bet). If the bet wins (which happens with probability {{frac2|1|38}} in American roulette), the payoff is $35; otherwise the player loses the bet. The expected profit from such a bet will be\n:: <math>   \\operatorname{E}[\\,\\text{gain from }\\$1\\text{ bet}\\,] = -\\$1 \\cdot \\frac{37}{38} + \\$35 \\cdot \\frac{1}{38} = -\\$\\frac{1}{19}.</math>\n\n:That is, the bet of $1 stands to lose <math>-\\$\\frac{1}{19}</math>, so its expected value is <math>-\\$\\frac{1}{19}.</math>\n\n===Countably infinite case===\nIntuitively, the expectation of a random variable taking values in a countable set of outcomes is defined analogously as the weighted sum of the outcome values, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of realizing that value. However, convergence issues associated with the infinite sum necessitate a more careful definition. A rigorous definition first defines expectation of a non-negative random variable, and then adapts it to general random variables.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a non-negative random variable with a countable set of outcomes <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots,</math> occurring with probabilities <math>p_1, p_2, \\ldots,</math> respectively. Analogous to the discrete case, the expected value of <math>X</math> is then defined as the series\n: <math>    \\operatorname{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i\\, p_i.</math>\nNote that since <math>x_i p_i \\geq 0</math>, the infinite sum is well-defined and does not depend on the [[absolute convergence|order]] in which it is computed. Unlike the discrete case, the expectation here can be equal to infinity, if the infinite sum above increases without bound.\n\n====Examples====\n\n*Suppose <math>x_i = i</math> and <math> p_i = \\frac{k}{i2^i},</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots</math>, where <math>k = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}</math> (with <math>\\ln</math> being the [[natural logarithm]]) is the scale factor such that the probabilities sum to 1. Then, using the direct definition for non-negative random variables, we have\n::<math>\\operatorname{E}[X]= \\sum_i x_i p_i = 1\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{k}{8}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{k}{24}\\right) + \\dots = \\frac{k}{2}+\\frac{k}{4}+\\frac{k}{8}+\\dots = k.</math>\n\n*An example where the expectation is infinite arises in the context of the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]. Let <math>x_i=2^i</math> and <math>p_i=\\frac{1}{2^i}</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots</math>. Once again, since the random variable is non-negative, the expected value calculation gives\n::<math> \\operatorname{E}[X]= \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty x_i\\,p_i  =2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}+4\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} + 8\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+ 16\\cdot\\frac{1}{16}+ \\cdots = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \\cdots  \\, = \\infty. </math>\n\n*For an example where the expectation is not well-defined, suppose the random variable <math>X</math> takes values 1, \u22122, 3, \u22124, ..., with respective probabilities <math>\\frac{c}{1^2},\\frac{c}{2^2},\\frac{c}{3^2},\\frac{c}{4^2}</math>, ..., where <math>c=\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}</math> is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum up to one. \n:Define <math>X^+(\\omega)=\\max(X(\\omega),0)</math> and <math>X^-(\\omega)=-\\min(X(\\omega),0)</math>. It follows that <math>X^+</math> takes value <math>2k-1</math> with probability <math>c/(2k-1)^2</math> for <math> k = 1,2,3,\\cdots</math> and takes value <math>0</math> with remaining probability. Similarly, <math>X^-</math> takes value <math>2k</math> with probability <math>c/(2k)^2</math> for <math> k = 1,2,3,\\cdots</math> and takes value <math>0</math> with remaining probability.

In particular, for a random variable <math>X</math> with well-defined expectation, <math>\\operatorname{E}[\\operatorname{E}[X]]=\\operatorname{E}[X]</math>. A well defined expectation implies that there is one number, or rather, one constant that defines the expected value. Thus follows that the expectation of this constant is just the original expected value.\n*\n\n== Uses and applications ==\nThe expectation of a random variable plays an important role in a variety of contexts. For example, in [[decision theory]], an agent making an optimal choice in the context of incomplete information is often assumed to maximize the expected value of their [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility function|utility function]].\nFor a different example, in [[statistics]], where one seeks estimates for unknown parameters based on available data, the estimate itself is a random variable. In such settings, a desirable criterion for a \"good\" estimator is that it is [[unbiased estimator|unbiased]] \u2013 that is, the expected value of the estimate is equal to the true value of the underlying parameter.\n\nIt is possible to construct an expected value equal to the probability of an event by taking the expectation of an [[indicator function]] that is one if the event has occurred and zero otherwise. This relationship can be used to translate properties of expected values into properties of probabilities, e.g. using the law of large numbers to justify estimating probabilities by [[Statistical frequency|frequencies]].\n\nThe expected values of the powers of ''X'' are called the [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of ''X''; the [[moment about the mean|moments about the mean]] of ''X'' are expected values of powers of ''X'' \u2212 E[''X'']. The moments of some random variables can be used to specify their distributions, via their [[moment generating function]]s.\n\nTo empirically [[Estimation theory|estimate]] the expected value of a random variable, one repeatedly measures observations of the variable and computes the [[arithmetic mean]] of the results. If the expected value exists, this procedure estimates the true expected value in an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] manner and has the property of minimizing the sum of the squares of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (the sum of the squared differences between the observations and the [[estimator|estimate]]). The [[law of large numbers]] demonstrates (under fairly mild conditions) that, as the [[Sample size|size]] of the [[statistical sample|sample]] gets larger, the [[variance]] of this [[estimator|estimate]] gets smaller.\n\nThis property is often exploited in a wide variety of applications, including general problems of [[statistical estimation]] and [[machine learning]], to estimate (probabilistic) quantities of interest via [[Monte Carlo methods]], since most quantities of interest can be written in terms of expectation, e.g. <math>\\operatorname{P}({X \\in \\mathcal{A}}) = \\operatorname{E}[{\\mathbf 1}_{\\mathcal{A}}]</math>, where <math> {\\mathbf 1}_{\\mathcal{A}}</math> is the indicator function of the set <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.\n\n[[File:Beta first moment.svg|thumb|The mass of probability distribution is balanced at the expected value, here a Beta(\u03b1,\u03b2) distribution with expected value \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2).]] In [[classical mechanics]], the [[center of mass]] is an analogous concept to expectation. For example, suppose ''X'' is a discrete random variable with values ''x<sub>i</sub>'' and corresponding probabilities ''p<sub>i</sub>''. Now consider a weightless rod on which are placed weights, at locations ''x<sub>i</sub>'' along the rod and having masses ''p<sub>i</sub>'' (whose sum is one). The point at which the rod balances is E[''X''].\n\nExpected values can also be used to compute the [[variance]], by means of the computational formula for the variance\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Var}(X)=  \\operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\\operatorname{E}[X])^2.</math>\n\nA very important application of the expectation value is in the field of [[quantum mechanics]]. The expectation value of a quantum mechanical operator <math>\\hat{A}</math> operating on a [[quantum state]] vector <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is written as <math>\\langle\\hat{A}\\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle</math>. The [[uncertainty principle|uncertainty]] in <math>\\hat{A}</math> can be calculated using the formula <math>(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle\\hat{A}^2\\rangle - \\langle \\hat{A} \\rangle^2 </math>.\n\n==== Interchanging limits and expectation ====\nIn general, it is not the case that <math>\\operatorname{E}[X_n] \\to \\operatorname{E}[X]</math> despite <math>X_n\\to X</math> pointwise. Thus, one cannot interchange limits and expectation, without additional conditions on the random variables. To see this, let <math>U</math> be a random variable distributed uniformly on <math>[0,1]</math>. For <math>n\\geq 1,</math> define a sequence of random variables\n\n:<math>\nX_n = n \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\left\\{ U \\in  \\left[0,\\tfrac{1}{n}\\right]\\right\\},\n</math>\n\nwith <math>{\\mathbf 1}\\{A\\}</math> being the indicator function of the event <math>A</math>. Then, it follows that <math>X_n \\to 0</math> (a.s). But, <math>\\operatorname{E}[X_n] = n \\cdot \\operatorname{P}\\left(U \\in \\left[ 0, \\tfrac{1}{n}\\right] \\right) = n \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{n} = 1</math> for each <math>n</math>. Hence, <math> \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\operatorname{E}[X_n] = 1 \\neq 0 = \\operatorname{E}\\left[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} X_n \\right].</math>\n\nAnalogously, for general sequence of random variables <math>\\{ Y_n : n \\geq 0\\}</math>, the expected value operator is not <math>\\sigma</math>-additive, i.e.\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{E}\\left[\\sum^\\infty_{n=0} Y_n\\right] \\neq \\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\operatorname{E}[Y_n].\n</math>\n\nAn example is easily obtained by setting <math>Y_0 = X_1</math> and <math>Y_n = X_{n+1} - X_n</math> for <math>n \\geq 1</math>, where <math>X_n</math> is as in the previous example.\n\nA number of convergence results specify exact conditions which allow one to interchange limits and expectations, as specified below.\n\n*[[Monotone convergence theorem]]: Let <math>\\{X_n : n \\geq 0\\}</math> be a sequence of random variables, with <math>0 \\leq X_n \\leq X_{n+1}</math> (a.s) for each <math> n \\geq 0</math>.

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] restricted immigration to its overseas possessions to Catholics with \"pure\" ancestry, (''[[limpieza de sangre]]''),  that is, without taint of Jewish or Muslim ancestors. Prospective immigrants had to obtain a license from the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n|House of Trade]] in Seville, Spain, attesting to their religious status and ancestry. So-called [[New Christians]], that is Jewish converts to Catholicism, were forbidden from immigrating for fear they had falsely claimed conversion and were in fact [[crypto-Jews]] passing as Christians.<ref>Fisher, John R. \"Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;589\u201390. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> During the period when Spain and Portugal had the same monarch (1580-1640), many Portuguese merchants immigrated to Mexico. Religious authorities suspected they were crypto-Jews. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was established in 1571 and arrested, tried, and then turned those convicted over to civil authorities for corporal, sometimes capital, punishment in [[auto de fe|autos de fe]].\n\nEarly Spanish immigrants to Mexico included men who became crown or ecclesiastical officials, those with connections to the privileged group of conquerors who had access to indigenous labor and tribute via the [[encomienda]], but also Spaniards who saw economic opportunity in Mexico. Not all Spaniards were of noble heritage ([[hidalgo|hidalgos]]); many were merchants and miners, as well as artisans of various types. Spanish women immigrated from the conquest era onward, most usually because they joined family members who had already immigrated. Their presence helped consolidate the Spanish colony. Spaniards founded cities, sometimes on the sites of indigenous cities, the most prominent being [[Mexico City]] founded on the ruins of Aztec [[Tenochtitlan]]. Spaniards preferred living in cities and with so many immigrant artisans present from an early period, Spanish material culture was replicated in Mexico by tailors, leather workers, bakers, makers of weapons, construction workers, book sellers, and medical specialists (barber-surgeons). In 1550, of the 8,000 Spanish immigrants in Mexico City, around ten percent were artisans.<ref>Altman, Ida. \"Spanish Society in Mexico City After the Conquest.\" Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1991)71(3):413-45.</ref><ref>Altman, Ida et al.

New York: Cambridge University Press 2018.</ref> Because Mexico had such a dense indigenous population, Spaniards imported fewer African slaves than they did the Caribbean, where sugar cultivation necessitated a large labor force and indigenous labors were absent.\n\nAlthough most European immigrants were from various regions of Spain, there were Europeans with other origins including Italians, Flemish (most prominently [[Pedro de Gante]]), Greeks, French, and a few Irish (including [[William Lamport]]). Except for the Portuguese, many of these other Europeans assimilated into larger Hispanic society.<ref>Altman, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 263.</ref> Seventeenth-century English Dominican friar [[Thomas Gage (priest)|Thomas Gage]] spent a few years in central Mexico and Guatemala and wrote a colorful memoir of his time there, but he returned to England and renounced Catholicism.<ref>''Thomas Gage's Travels in the New World'', J.E.S. Thompson (ed.), University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1958.</ref>\n\n===Post-independence, 1821-1920 ===\nEven after Mexico achieved [[Mexican war of independence|independence]] of Spain in 1821, it continued to exclude non-Catholics from immigrating until the [[La Reforma|liberal Reform]].  The Spanish crown's controls over foreigners doing business in Mexico were no longer in place, and some British businessmen took an interest in silver mining in northern Mexico. The Mexican government sought to populate areas of the north as a buffer against indigenous attacks. The Mexican government gave a license to [[Stephen F. Austin]] to colonize areas in Texas, with the proviso that they be or become Catholics and learn Spanish, largely honored in the breach as more and more settlers arrived. Most settlers were from the slave-holding areas of the southern U.S. and brought their slaves with them to cultivate the rich soil of east Texas.\n\n== Immigration policy ==\n{{see also|Mexican nationality law}}\n[[File:Ni\u00f1os polacos de Santa Rosa, Guanajuato.jpg|thumbnail|Orphaned Polish children in Guanajuato that arrived with a larger group of refugees during the [[Second World War]].]]\n\nWith the Mexican government's intent to control migration flows and attract foreigners who can contribute to economic development, the new migration law simplifies foreigners\u2019 entrance and residency requirements. It replaces the two large immigration categories\u2014immigrant and nonimmigrant\u2014with the categories of \u201cvisitor\u201d and \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, while keeping the status of \u201cpermanent resident\u201d. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners\u2014i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.\u2014each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.<ref>Gonzalez-Murphy, Laura. \"Protecting Immigrant Rights in Mexico: Understanding the State-Civil Society Nexus,\"  Routledge, New York, Forthcoming 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law\u2014published on 28 September 2012\u2014 immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants.\n\nUndocumented immigration has been a problem for Mexico, especially since the 1970s. Although the number of deportations is declining with 61,034 registered cases in 2011, the Mexican government documented over 200,000 unauthorized border crossings in 2004 and 2005.<ref>\"Estad\u00edsticas\"</ref> In 2011, 93% of undocumented immigrants in Mexico came from three countries -[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]- however, there is an increasing number of immigrants from [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Indios, chinos, somal\u00edes\u2026 as\u00ed son los migrantes invisibles de M\u00e9xico|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2011/07/110722_mexico_migrantes_indios_chinos_irm.shtml|publisher=BBC Mundo|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== History of immigration policy ===\n[[File:Inmigraci\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico 2015.png|thumb|400px|right|<center>Immigrants in [[M\u00e9xico]], census [[OCDE]] 2015.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3343,en_2649_33931_34063091_1_1_1_1,00.html Immigrants in Mexico, census OCDE 2000] OCDE</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Japanese immigrants in Sonora.jpg|thumbnail|[[Japanese immigration to Mexico|Japanese]] immigrant workers at the mine of [[Cananea]], Sonora in the 1910s.

Spanish women immigrated from the conquest era onward, most usually because they joined family members who had already immigrated. Their presence helped consolidate the Spanish colony. Spaniards founded cities, sometimes on the sites of indigenous cities, the most prominent being [[Mexico City]] founded on the ruins of Aztec [[Tenochtitlan]]. Spaniards preferred living in cities and with so many immigrant artisans present from an early period, Spanish material culture was replicated in Mexico by tailors, leather workers, bakers, makers of weapons, construction workers, book sellers, and medical specialists (barber-surgeons). In 1550, of the 8,000 Spanish immigrants in Mexico City, around ten percent were artisans.<ref>Altman, Ida. \"Spanish Society in Mexico City After the Conquest.\" Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1991)71(3):413-45.</ref><ref>Altman, Ida et al.

Except for the Portuguese, many of these other Europeans assimilated into larger Hispanic society.<ref>Altman, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 263.</ref> Seventeenth-century English Dominican friar [[Thomas Gage (priest|Thomas Gage]] spent a few years in central Mexico and Guatemala and wrote a colorful memoir of his time there, but he returned to England and renounced Catholicism.<ref>''Thomas Gage's Travels in the New World'', J.E.S. Thompson (ed.), University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1958.</ref>\n\n===Post-independence, 1821-1920 ===\nEven after Mexico achieved [[Mexican war of independence|independence]] of Spain in 1821, it continued to exclude non-Catholics from immigrating until the [[La Reforma|liberal Reform]].  The Spanish crown's controls over foreigners doing business in Mexico were no longer in place, and some British businessmen took an interest in silver mining in northern Mexico. The Mexican government sought to populate areas of the north as a buffer against indigenous attacks. The Mexican government gave a license to [[Stephen F. Austin]] to colonize areas in Texas, with the proviso that they be or become Catholics and learn Spanish, largely honored in the breach as more and more settlers arrived. Most settlers were from the slave-holding areas of the southern U.S. and brought their slaves with them to cultivate the rich soil of east Texas.\n\n== Immigration policy ==\n{{see also|Mexican nationality law}}\n[[File:Ni\u00f1os polacos de Santa Rosa, Guanajuato.jpg|thumbnail|Orphaned Polish children in Guanajuato that arrived with a larger group of refugees during the [[Second World War]].]]\n\nWith the Mexican government's intent to control migration flows and attract foreigners who can contribute to economic development, the new migration law simplifies foreigners\u2019 entrance and residency requirements. It replaces the two large immigration categories\u2014immigrant and nonimmigrant\u2014with the categories of \u201cvisitor\u201d and \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, while keeping the status of \u201cpermanent resident\u201d. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners\u2014i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.\u2014each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.<ref>Gonzalez-Murphy, Laura. \"Protecting Immigrant Rights in Mexico: Understanding the State-Civil Society Nexus,\"  Routledge, New York, Forthcoming 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law\u2014published on 28 September 2012\u2014 immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants.\n\nUndocumented immigration has been a problem for Mexico, especially since the 1970s. Although the number of deportations is declining with 61,034 registered cases in 2011, the Mexican government documented over 200,000 unauthorized border crossings in 2004 and 2005.<ref>\"Estad\u00edsticas\"</ref> In 2011, 93% of undocumented immigrants in Mexico came from three countries -[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]- however, there is an increasing number of immigrants from [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Indios, chinos, somal\u00edes\u2026 as\u00ed son los migrantes invisibles de M\u00e9xico|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2011/07/110722_mexico_migrantes_indios_chinos_irm.shtml|publisher=BBC Mundo|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== History of immigration policy ===\n[[File:Inmigraci\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico 2015.png|thumb|400px|right|<center>Immigrants in [[M\u00e9xico]], census [[OCDE]] 2015.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3343,en_2649_33931_34063091_1_1_1_1,00.html Immigrants in Mexico, census OCDE 2000] OCDE</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Japanese immigrants in Sonora.jpg|thumbnail|[[Japanese immigration to Mexico|Japanese]] immigrant workers at the mine of [[Cananea]], Sonora in the 1910s.

Many, such as executives, professionals, scientists, artists, or athletes working for either Mexican or foreign companies, arrive with secure jobs. Retirement is the main motivation for immigrants who tend to be more permanent.

{"title_page": "John Richard Clark Hall", "text_new": "'''John Richard Clark Hall''' (1855 \u2013 6 August 1931) was a scholar of [[Old English]], notable for his work on ''[[Beowulf]]''. In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and was the only son of James John Hall.{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}} He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of London]] in 1889,{{sfn|''The Times''|1889}} and in 1891 received a [[Master of Arts]] in English and French from the same school.{{sfn|''The Times''|1891}} By 1894, he had received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]{{sfn|Hall|1894|p=i}} On 16 May 1881, then a clerk in the [[Local Government Board]], Hall was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}}\n\n== Career ==\nHall published multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'',{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n=== ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' ===\nHall's dictionary of [[Old English]], subtitled ''For the Use of Students'',{{sfn|Hall|1894}} quickly became a standard upon its publication in 1894.{{sfn|Chermayeff|1962}} The work offered a significantly more complete reference than the prevailing dictionary at the time, [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50, 52}}{{sfn|''Journal of Education''|1895}}{{sfn|''The Journal of Education''|1894}} \"At last\", wrote ''The Guardian'', \"we have a complete Anglo-Saxon dictionary, complete form A to the very end of the alphabet.\"{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1895}} Even after Bosworth's work was revised by [[Thomas Northcote Toller]]'s in 1898, ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' continued to serve prominently as an introductory resource.{{sfn|Garnett|1898|pp=327\u2013328}} \n\nThe first edition of the dictionary attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts, and critics noted that this introduced its own share of confusion.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall eliminated this approach in a 1916 second edition, acknowledging that this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} Thenceforth he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall also began indicating words found only in poetical texts and providing the source of words recorded only once, and added cross references to corresponding entries in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'', then underway.{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=154}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} The edition was \"markedly superior to the first edition\" according to a reviewer for ''[[Modern Philology]]'',{{sfn|Knott|1917}} and according to [[Frederick Klaeber]], \"[i]ts outward make-up is almost an ideal one.\"{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=153}}\n\nA third and significantly expanded edition followed in 1931;{{sfn|Hall|1931}} according to [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], it was \"to all intents and purposes [a] completely new edition\", and \"a notable monument to the memory of its author\", who died the year of publication.{{sfn|Magoun|1932|p=288}} A fourth edition\u2014a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt{{sfn|Muinzer|1963|p=786}}{{sfn|Campbell|1962}}\u2014came in 1960.{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1960}} This was itself reprinted by the [[University of Toronto Press]] starting in 1984,{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1984}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and is still in print as of 2020.{{sfn|University of Toronto Press}}\n\n=== ''Beowulf'' ===\nIn 1901, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Hall|1901}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}{{refn|group=note|The eighth translation, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}}} It was lauded at its outset for containing both a \"decidedly better\" translation than any in current use, as wrote ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'',{{sfn|The Manchester Guardian|1901}} and what [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] described as \"a useful compendium of Beowulf material\".{{sfn|Tinker|1902|p=379}} The first edition was followed by a corrected second in 1911.{{sfn|Hall|1911}}{{sfn|Windle|1912}} Such revision was \"welcome\", wrote [[Allen Mawer]], \"for it is probably the best working translation that we have\".{{sfn|Mawer|1911}} The work became \"the standard trot to ''Beowulf''\";{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1967|p=774}} according to [[Marijane Osborn]] it was \"still the 'crib of choice' in Oxford in the 1960s\".{{sfn|Osborn|1997|p=342}}\n\nHe followed this up in 1914 with another translation, this time in [[Metre (poetry)|metre]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} In 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nHall married Mary Ann Elizabeth Symes on 29 November 1883.{{sfn|Dorset Marriages|1883}} The two had four children, three of whom survived: Cecil Symes (born {{circa}} 1887), Irene Clark (born {{circa}} 1886), and the entomologist [[Wilfrid Hall|Wilfrid John]] (born 1892).{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Census|1911}}{{sfn|''Who Was Who''|2007}}\n\nHall was a member of the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]], joining in 1910.{{sfn|Yorkshire Philosophical Society|1911}} He died in 1931.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} He had been living in [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} His obituary labeled him a \"protestant reformer\", noted that he had formerly been on the Local Government Board in [[Whitehall]], and that he had a net [[Personal property|personalty]] of \u00a313,309 and a gross of \u00a315,762.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1931}}\n\n== Publications ==\n=== Books ===\n*

In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and was the only son of James John Hall.{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}} He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of London]] in 1889,{{sfn|''The Times''|1889}} and in 1891 received a [[Master of Arts]] in English and French from the same school.{{sfn|''The Times''|1891}} By 1894, he had received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]{{sfn|Hall|1894|p=i}} On 16 May 1881, then a clerk in the [[Local Government Board]], Hall was admitted to [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Foster|1889|p=491}}\n\n== Career ==\nHall published multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'',{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}\n\n=== ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' ===\nHall's dictionary of [[Old English]], subtitled ''For the Use of Students'',{{sfn|Hall|1894}} quickly became a standard upon its publication in 1894.{{sfn|Chermayeff|1962}} The work offered a significantly more complete reference than the prevailing dictionary at the time, [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50, 52}}{{sfn|''Journal of Education''|1895}}{{sfn|''The Journal of Education''|1894}} \"At last\", wrote ''The Guardian'', \"we have a complete Anglo-Saxon dictionary, complete form A to the very end of the alphabet.\"{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1895}} Even after Bosworth's work was revised by [[Thomas Northcote Toller]]'s in 1898, ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' continued to serve prominently as an introductory resource.{{sfn|Garnett|1898|pp=327\u2013328}} \n\nThe first edition of the dictionary attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts, and critics noted that this introduced its own share of confusion.{{sfn|Chase|1895|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall eliminated this approach in a 1916 second edition, acknowledging that this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} Thenceforth he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} Hall also began indicating words found only in poetical texts and providing the source of words recorded only once, and added cross references to corresponding entries in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'', then underway.{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=154}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} The edition was \"markedly superior to the first edition\" according to a reviewer for ''[[Modern Philology]]'',{{sfn|Knott|1917}} and according to [[Frederick Klaeber]], \"[i]ts outward make-up is almost an ideal one.\"{{sfn|Klaeber|1918|p=153}}\n\nA third and significantly expanded edition followed in 1931;{{sfn|Hall|1931}} according to [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], it was \"to all intents and purposes [a] completely new edition\", and \"a notable monument to the memory of its author\", who died the year of publication.{{sfn|Magoun|1932|p=288}} A fourth edition\u2014a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt{{sfn|Muinzer|1963|p=786}}{{sfn|Campbell|1962}}\u2014came in 1960.{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1960}} This was itself reprinted by the [[University of Toronto Press]] starting in 1984,{{sfn|Hall|Meritt|1984}}{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and is still in print as of 2020.{{sfn|University of Toronto Press}}\n\n=== ''Beowulf'' ===\nIn 1901, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Hall|1901}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}{{refn|group=note|The eighth translation, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}}} It was lauded at its outset for containing both a \"decidedly better\" translation than any in current use, as wrote ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'',{{sfn|The Manchester Guardian|1901}} and what [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]] described as \"a useful compendium of Beowulf material\".{{sfn|Tinker|1902|p=379}} The first edition was followed by a corrected second in 1911.{{sfn|Hall|1911}}{{sfn|Windle|1912}} Such revision was \"welcome\", wrote [[Allen Mawer]], \"for it is probably the best working translation that we have\".{{sfn|Mawer|1911}} The work became \"the standard trot to ''Beowulf''\";{{sfn|Chickering Jr.|1967|p=774}} according to [[Marijane Osborn]] was \"still the 'crib of choice' in Oxford in the 1960s\".{{sfn|Osborn|1997|p=342}}\n\nHe followed this up in 1914 with another translation, this time in [[Metre (poetry)|metre]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} In 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nHall married Mary Ann Elizabeth Symes on 29 November 1883.{{sfn|Dorset Marriages|1883}} The two had four children, three of whom survived: Cecil Symes (born {{circa}} 1887), Irene Clark (born {{circa}} 1886), and the entomologist [[Wilfrid Hall|Wilfrid John]] (born 1892).{{sfn|England Census|1891}}{{sfn|England Census|1911}}{{sfn|''Who Was Who''|2007}}\n\nHall was a member of the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]], joining in 1910.{{sfn|Yorkshire Philosophical Society|1911}} He died in 1931.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} He had been living in [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} His obituary labeled him a \"protestant reformer\", noted that he had formerly been on the Local Government Board in [[Whitehall]], and that he had a net [[Personal property|personalty]] of \u00a313,309 and a gross of \u00a315,762.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian''|1931}}\n\n== Publications ==\n=== Books ===\n*

Scale: 1:25 000.Publisher: Ordnance Survey B4 edition (2013). {{ISBN|978 0319239773}}</ref> {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} northeast of Bristol city centre and {{convert|103|mi|km|abbr=}} due west of London. Not far from the [[Severn Estuary]] of the [[Bristol Channel]], Bradley Stoke is bordered by three motorways; the [[M5 motorway|M5]] to the north, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] to the east and the [[M32 motorway|M32]] to the south.\n\nPlanned in the 1970s, building began in 1987. Bradley Stoke was Europe's largest new town built with private investment and was named after the local Bradley Brook and [[Stoke Brook]] streams. The Willow Brook Centre, Bradley Stoke's town centre and shopping hub, attracts more than six million visitors every year. The town is predominantly residential but was planned on a self-standing basis with retail, leisure and commercial areas in the North, South and Central areas, and various business parks on the outskirts of the town.\n\n==History==\nThe area that is now Bradley Stoke was once a farmland north of the village of [[Stoke Gifford]] near Bristol city. The land was divided between the  [[civil parishes]] of Stoke Gifford and [[Almondsbury]]. The area consisted of a number of farms, Bailey's Court and Watch Elm Farm in the south, Bowsland Farm and Manor Farm in the north and Webb's Farm in the middle. Some of the lands were used as pasture. A number of woods also existed, Sherbourne's Brake, Webb's Wood and the large Savage's Wood have all been preserved. Fiddlers Wood, the name of which lives on in Fiddlers Wood Lane was all but obliterated by the M4 motorway. Baileys Court Farmhouse is the only original building that still remains and was used as offices by the towns developers before becoming the Bailey's Court Inn. Watch Elm Farm was named after the Watch Elm, an elm of a legendary size that blew down in the mid 18th century. The Stoke Brook flows through the middle of Bradley Stoke.\n\nDuring its development, the new settlement faced some problems in the wake of a national recession. At the time, Bradley Stoke was reputed to be one of Europe's largest private housing developments and did struggle to develop at first to establish itself as an identifiable town unlike other earlier new towns which were supported by a [[Development Corporation|New Town Development Corporation]], as the settlement relied principally on private investment within a restricted statutory framework of the local authority [[Northavon|Northavon District Council]] within the [[Avon County Council]] area. A combination of private house builder led the development and with only limited input from commercial businesses and the consequent recession resulted in the new town gaining a reputation for being a soulless housing estate with only limited facilities and no town centre, with the exception of a [[Tesco]] supermarket. High-interest rates during the early 1990s soon led to the collapse of the property market in the area with many new homes falling into negative equity. This led to the branding of the new town as, accurately named, 'Sadly Broke'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6227609.stm|title=BBC NEWS - the UK - England - Bristol/Somerset - 'Sadly Broke' celebrates 20 years|publisher=}}</ref> until property values and the development market began to recover.\n\n==Governance==\nBradley Stoke has a [[Town Council]] made up of 15 Councillors elected from seven wards to administer the local issues. The Town Council is chaired by the Town [[Mayor]] and is assisted by the Deputy Town Mayor. The three standing committees of the Town Council acts as deliberative wings of the Council. Decisions of the Council are carried out by officers and staff employed by the Council headed by the Town Clerk.\n\nBradley Stoke is part of the South Gloucestershire County Council which acts as its Unitary Authority. Bradley Stoke Town is represented in the South Gloucestershire Council by six Councillors elected from four [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]]. Bradley Stoke occupies the central part of the Filton and Bradley Stoke Parliamentary constituency, which elects one [[Member of Parliament]].\n\nUntil 1996 the area was under a rather unpopular two-tier structure, which had previously been rolled out across the UK in 1974.  The system supported counties and district councils, counties being the higher tier.  Bradley Stoke was part of the district of [[Northavon]], which was in turn part of the county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], however when this structure was abolished in 1996 in favour of unitary authorities, the area became part of the newly-formed South Gloucestershire.\n\nFirst elected in 2010, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Jack Lopresti]] is the MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/filton-and-bradley-stoke|title=Election 2017 dashboard|website=Democratic Dashboard|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n===Town council===\nThe membership of the town council, as of the election held in May 2019, is shown in the table below.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bradleystoke.gov.uk/elections-2019.php |title=Elections 2019 |publisher=Bradley Stoke Town Council |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!Name!!Ward!!Party\n|-\n|'''Tom Aditya ([[Mayors in England|Mayor]])'''||rowspan=7|Bradley Stoke South||rowspan=6 style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Roger Avenin\n|-\n|Theresa Cullen\n|-\n|Michael Hill\n|-\n|Ben Randles\n|-\n|Edward Rose\n|-\n|''Vacant''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bradleystoke.gov.uk/docs/meetings/Council-Draft-2020-01-15.docx |title=Full Council Draft Minutes - 15th January 2020 |date=15 January 2020 |publisher=Bradley Stoke Town Council |accessdate=11 February 2020 |format=[[Office Open XML|DOCX]]}}</ref>||\n|-\n|Fabrizio Fazzino||rowspan=6|Bradley Stoke North||style=\"background:red; color:white;\"|Labour\n|-\n|Tony Griffiths||style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Elaine Hardwick||style=\"background:white;\"|Citizens Movement Party UK<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bradleystokejournal.co.uk/2019/10/02/former-bradley-stoke-mayor-launches-new-political-party/ |title=Former Bradley Stoke mayor launches new political party |work=Bradley Stoke Journal |date=2 October 2019 |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|Brian Hopkinson||rowspan=2 style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Franklin Owusu-Antwi\n|-\n|Andy Ward||Independent\n|-\n|John Ashe||rowspan=2|Stoke Brook||rowspan=7 style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Keith Cranney\n|}\n\n==Twin cities==\nBradley Stoke is twinned with [[Champs-sur-Marne]], [[France]]<ref>[[Champs sur Marne#Twin towns]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-champssurmarne.fr/decouverte/commune.asp|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091418/http://www.ville-champssurmarne.fr/decouverte/commune.asp|archivedate=7 April 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 April 2014|df=dmy}}</ref> located in the Paris suburbs.\n\n==Facilities==\nMany of the facilities in the town were to be funded by the housing developers from housing sales, via '[[Town and Country Planning Act 1990#Section 106|Section 106]]' planning agreements.

Scale: 1:25 000.Publisher: Ordnance Survey B4 edition (2013). {{ISBN|978 0319239773}}</ref> {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} northeast of Bristol city centre and {{convert|103|mi|km|abbr=}} due west of London. Not far from the [[Severn Estuary]] of the [[Bristol Channel]], Bradley Stoke is bordered by three motorways; the [[M5 motorway|M5]] to the north, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] to the east and the [[M32 motorway|M32]] to the south.\n\nPlanned in the 1970s, building began in 1987. Bradley Stoke was Europe's largest new town built with private investment and was named after the local Bradley Brook and [[Stoke Brook]] streams. The Willow Brook Centre, Bradley Stoke's town centre and shopping hub, attracts more than six million visitors every year. The town is predominantly residential but was planned on a self-standing basis with retail, leisure and commercial areas in the North, South and Central areas, and various business parks on the outskirts of the town.\n\n==History==\nThe area that is now Bradley Stoke was once a farmland north of the village of [[Stoke Gifford]] near Bristol city. The land was divided between the  [[civil parishes]] of Stoke Gifford and [[Almondsbury]]. The area consisted of a number of farms, Bailey's Court and Watch Elm Farm in the south, Bowsland Farm and Manor Farm in the north and Webb's Farm in the middle. Some of the lands were used as pasture. A number of woods also existed, Sherbourne's Brake, Webb's Wood and the large Savage's Wood have all been preserved. Fiddlers Wood, the name of which lives on in Fiddlers Wood Lane was all but obliterated by the M4 motorway. Baileys Court Farmhouse is the only original building that still remains and was used as offices by the towns developers before becoming the Bailey's Court Inn. Watch Elm Farm was named after the Watch Elm, an elm of a legendary size that blew down in the mid 18th century. The Stoke Brook flows through the middle of Bradley Stoke.\n\nDuring its development, the new settlement faced some problems in the wake of a national recession. At the time, Bradley Stoke was reputed to be one of Europe's largest private housing developments and did struggle to develop at first to establish itself as an identifiable town unlike other earlier new towns which were supported by a [[Development Corporation|New Town Development Corporation]], as the settlement relied principally on private investment within a restricted statutory framework of the local authority [[Northavon|Northavon District Council]] within the [[Avon County Council]] area. A combination of private house builder led the development and with only limited input from commercial businesses and the consequent recession resulted in the new town gaining a reputation for being a soulless housing estate with only limited facilities and no town centre, with the exception of a [[Tesco]] supermarket. High-interest rates during the early 1990s soon led to the collapse of the property market in the area with many new homes falling into negative equity. This led to the branding of the new town as, accurately named, 'Sadly Broke'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6227609.stm|title=BBC NEWS - the UK - England - Bristol/Somerset - 'Sadly Broke' celebrates 20 years|publisher=}}</ref> until property values and the development market began to recover.\n\n==Governance==\nBradley Stoke has a [[Town Council]] made up of 15 Councillors elected from seven wards to administer the local issues. The Town Council is chaired by the Town [[Mayor]] and is assisted by the Deputy Town Mayor. The three standing committees of the Town Council acts as deliberative wings of the Council. Decisions of the Council are carried out by officers and staff employed by the Council headed by the Town Clerk.\n\nBradley Stoke is part of the South Gloucestershire County Council which acts as its Unitary Authority. Bradley Stoke Town is represented in the South Gloucestershire Council by six Councillors elected from four [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]]. Bradley Stoke occupies the central part of the Filton and Bradley Stoke Parliamentary constituency, which elects one [[Member of Parliament]].\n\nUntil 1996 the area was under a rather unpopular two-tier structure, which had previously been rolled out across the UK in 1974.  The system supported counties and district councils, counties being the higher tier.  Bradley Stoke was part of the district of [[Northavon]], which was in turn part of the county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], however when this structure was abolished in 1996 in favour of unitary authorities, the area became part of the newly-formed South Gloucestershire.\n\nFirst elected in 2010, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Jack Lopresti]] is the MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/filton-and-bradley-stoke|title=Election 2017 dashboard|website=Democratic Dashboard|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n===Town council===\nThe membership of the town council, as of the election held in May 2019, is shown in the table below.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bradleystoke.gov.uk/elections-2019.php |title=Elections 2019 |publisher=Bradley Stoke Town Council |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!Name!!Ward!!Party\n|-\n|'''Tom Aditya ([[Mayors in England|Mayor]])'''||rowspan=7|Bradley Stoke South||rowspan=6 style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Roger Avenin\n|-\n|Theresa Cullen\n|-\n|Michael Hill\n|-\n|Ben Randles\n|-\n|Edward Rose\n|-\n|''Vacant''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bradleystoke.gov.uk/docs/meetings/Council-Draft-2020-01-15.docx |title=Full Council Draft Minutes - 15th January 2020 |date=15 January 2020 |publisher=Bradley Stoke Town Council |accessdate=11 February 2020 |format=[[Office Open XML|DOCX]]}}</ref>||\n|-\n|Fabrizio Fazzino||rowspan=6|Bradley Stoke North||style=\"background:red; color:white;\"|Labour\n|-\n|Tony Griffiths||style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Elaine Hardwick||style=\"background:white;\"|Citizens Movement Party UK<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bradleystokejournal.co.uk/2019/10/02/former-bradley-stoke-mayor-launches-new-political-party/ |title=Former Bradley Stoke mayor launches new political party |work=Bradley Stoke Journal |date=2 October 2019 |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|Brian Hopkinson||rowspan=2 style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Franklin Owusu-Antwi\n|-\n|Andy Ward||Independent\n|-\n|John Ashe||rowspan=2|Stoke Brook||rowspan=7 style=\"background:blue; color:white;\"|Conservative\n|-\n|Keith Cranney\n|}\n\n==Twin cities==\nBradley Stoke is twinned with [[Champs-sur-Marne]], [[France]]<ref>[[Champs sur Marne#Twin towns]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-champssurmarne.fr/decouverte/commune.asp|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091418/http://www.ville-champssurmarne.fr/decouverte/commune.asp|archivedate=7 April 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 April 2014|df=dmy}}</ref> located in the Paris suburbs.\n\n==Facilities==\nMany of the facilities in the town were to be funded by the housing developers from housing sales, via '[[Town and Country Planning Act 1990#Section 106|Section 106]]' planning agreements.

It was part of a deal to rehouse some 200,000 people from inner-city [[Liverpool]] in new residential areas beyond the city's borders, with other families from inner-city Liverpool moving to other overspill places like [[Leasowe]], [[Huyton]], [[Kirkby]], [[Halewood]], [[Skelmersdale]] and later, Runcorn New Town.\n\nThe land on which Cantril Farm would be built was purchased by Liverpool council in 1961 for a sum of \u00a3132,500.\n\nThe first homes on the estate were ready for occupation during 1965, but initially the estate lacked facilities such as public transport, health care and shops, these facilities not being provided until about 1967. Mobile shops were located on the estate until permanent buildings were erected. The first [[Public house|pub]] on the estate was opened in 1968, around the same time that the first bus routes were established. [[Subway (underpass)|Subways]] were also erected to underpass the busiest roads on the estate for pedestrian safety. Small [[supermarket]]s were also erected in the late 1960s and the Withens Shopping Centre opened in 1970.\n\nSt Jude's Parish Church was opened in 1972 at a cost of \u00a340,000. St Albert's [[Roman Catholic]] church opened in 1966, and later on Cantril Farm [[Methodist]] Church opened. A second Parish Church, St Brigid's, opened in October 1967.\n\nIn the autumn of 1968 two primary schools were opened on the estate - St Albert's and St Brigid's.\n\nCantril High School was also opened to serve pupils aged 11\u201316, but it was only open for just over 20 years, closing in July 1991 due to falling pupil numbers. It was damaged in an arson attack not long after its closure and eventually demolished.\n\nA total of nine tower blocks were built in the late 1960s, however four of these were demolished in the 1990s and the five that remain have been refurbished in a multi million pound regeneration project which covered the whole estate.\n\nHowever, the estate was in deep decline by 1980. There was a riot on the estate in 1981. By 1982, unemployment on the estate was at 49% among males and 80% among young people. [[burglary]] and violent crime were rife on the estate. Shop units were becoming vacant. Household spaces were also becoming vacant as families were wanting to leave the estate and the vacant properties were difficult to let to new tenants. Two school buildings on the estate were wrecked in [[arson]] attacks and had to be completely rebuilt. Car theft was a serious problem in the 1980s and 1990s, when joyriding was at its peak nationally, as were arson attacks on parked vehicles.\n\nStockbridge Village Trust Limited was established on 18 February 1983 as a non-profit-making Private Company limited by guarantee. The estate within the Borough of Knowsley, which was owned by the Borough Council, was conveyed to the Trust on 6 April 1983, at the District Valuer's valuation of more than \u00a37million. This resulted in the Cantril Farm Estate being split, with two-thirds owned by the Trust, and one third owned by Liverpool City Council. The main part of the estate was renamed Stockbridge Village, while the section in Liverpool retained the Cantril Farm name.\n\nAs well as the demolition of the tower blocks, some 600 maisonettes and 340 low-rise flats were also bulldozed. The remaining properties were refurbished. The layout of the estate was altered to improve vehicular access. The shopping and recreational areas of the estate were also improved or replaced.\n\nAll council properties on the estate were transferred to the Village [[housing association]] in 1995.\n\nIn 2010, further regeneration work began on Stockbridge Village seeing a number of changes, such as the famous Heat Waves swimming baths being demolished as well as St Dominic's school being replaced by a new community centre and two new schools.\n\n==Notable people==\n*Footballer [[Micky Quinn]] grew up on the estate and lived there from 1967 until 1986.

It was part of a deal to rehouse some 200,000 people from inner-city [[Liverpool]] in new residential areas beyond the city's borders, with other families from inner-city Liverpool moving to other overspill places like [[Leasowe]], [[Huyton]], [[Kirkby]], [[Halewood]], [[Skelmersdale]] and later, Runcorn New Town.\n\nThe land on which Cantril Farm would be built was purchased by Liverpool council in 1961 for a sum of \u00a3132,500.\n\nThe first homes on the estate were ready for occupation during 1965, but initially the estate lacked facilities such as public transport, health care and shops, these facilities not being provided until about 1967. Mobile shops were located on the estate until permanent buildings were erected. The first [[Public house|pub]] on the estate was opened in 1968, around the same time that the first bus routes were established. [[Subway (underpass)|Subways]] were also erected to underpass the busiest roads on the estate for pedestrian safety. Small [[supermarket]]s were also erected in the late 1960s and the Withens Shopping Centre opened in 1970.\n\nSt Jude's Parish Church was opened in 1972 at a cost of \u00a340,000. St Albert's [[Roman Catholic]] church opened in 1966, and later on Cantril Farm [[Methodist]] Church opened. A second Parish Church, St Brigid's, opened in October 1967.\n\nIn the autumn of 1968 two primary schools were opened on the estate - St Albert's and St Brigid's.\n\nCantril High School was also opened to serve pupils aged 11\u201316, but it was only open for just over 20 years, closing in July 1991 due to falling pupil numbers. It was damaged in an arson attack not long after its closure and eventually demolished.\n\nA total of nine tower blocks were built in the late 1960s, however four of these were demolished in the 1990s and the five that remain have been refurbished in a multi million pound regeneration project which covered the whole estate.\n\nHowever, the estate was in deep decline by 1980. There was a riot on the estate in 1981. By 1982, unemployment on the estate was at 49% among males and 80% among young people. [[burglary]] and violent crime were rife on the estate. Shop units were becoming vacant. Household spaces were also becoming vacant as families were wanting to leave the estate and the vacant properties were difficult to let to new tenants. Two school buildings on the estate were wrecked in [[arson]] attacks and had to be completely rebuilt. Car theft was a serious problem in the 1980s and 1990s, when joyriding was at its peak nationally, as were arson attacks on parked vehicles.\n\nStockbridge Village Trust Limited was established on 18 February 1983 as a non-profit-making Private Company limited by guarantee. The estate within the Borough of Knowsley, which was owned by the Borough Council, was conveyed to the Trust on 6 April 1983, at the District Valuer's valuation of more than \u00a37million. This resulted in the Cantril Farm Estate being split, with two-thirds owned by the Trust, and one third owned by Liverpool City Council. The main part of the estate was renamed Stockbridge Village, while the section in Liverpool retained the Cantril Farm name.\n\nAs well as the demolition of the tower blocks, some 600 maisonettes and 340 low-rise flats were also bulldozed. The remaining properties were refurbished. The layout of the estate was altered to improve vehicular access. The shopping and recreational areas of the estate were also improved or replaced.\n\nAll council properties on the estate were transferred to the Village [[housing association]] in 1995.\n\nIn 2010, further regeneration work began on Stockbridge Village seeing a number of changes, such as the famous Heat Waves swimming baths being demolished as well as St Dominic's school being replaced by a new community centre and two new schools.\n\n==Notable people==\n*Footballer [[Micky Quinn]] grew up on the estate and lived there from 1967 until 1986. His father Mick Quinn senior now runs a pub in the area.\n*Footballer [[Ian Bishop (footballer)|Ian Bishop]] moved to the estate just after he was born in 1965. He later played for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n*Former [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] striker [[David Fairclough]] grew up on the estate after moving there as a child in the 1960s.\n*Comedian/actor [[Craig Charles]] moved to the estate just after he was born in 1964 and lived there until the 1980s.\n*Singer [[Paul Rutherford (singer)|Paul Rutherford]], a member of [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] (whose \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\" and \"[[Two Tribes]]\" hits topped the UK charts in 1984), also grew up on the estate after moving there as a child from an inner-city slum area when it was built in the 1960s.\n*The indie band [[Space (indie rock band)|Space]] wrote the song \"[[Neighbourhood (song)|Neighbourhood]]\" about the bandmembers' own experiences growing up on the Cantril Farm estate.\n*[[Joey McLoughlin]], a professional cyclist who won the [[Milk Race]] in 1986, grew up on Cantril Farm as the youngest of 10 children.\n* Former goalkeeper [[Billy Mercer (footballer born 1969)|Billy Mercer]] was born on the estate in 1969.
