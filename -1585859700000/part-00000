O.) Teodoreanu'''; July 30, 1894 \u2013 March 17, 1964), was a Romanian humorist, poet and gastronome, the brother of novelist [[Ionel Teodoreanu]] and brother in law of writer [[\u0218tefana Velisar Teodoreanu]]. He worked in many genres, but is best remembered for his [[parody]] texts and his [[epigram]]s, and less so for his [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] verse. His roots planted in the regional culture of [[Western Moldavia]], which became his main source of literary inspiration, P\u0103storel was at once an opinionated columnist, famous wine-drinking [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], and decorated war hero. He worked with the influential literary magazines of the 1920s, moving between ''[[G\u00e2ndirea]]'' and ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', and cultivated complex relationships with literary opinion-makers such as [[George C\u0103linescu]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful but scandalous debut in drama, Teodoreanu perfected his work as a satirist, producing material which targeted the historian-politician [[Nicolae Iorga]] and the literary scholar [[Giorge Pascu]], as well as food criticism which veered into fantasy literature. As an affiliate of ''[[\u021aara Noastr\u0103]]'', he favored a brand of [[Romanian nationalism]] which ran against Iorga's own. Corrosive or contemplative, P\u0103storel's various [[Sketch story|sketches]] dealt with social and political issues of the interwar, continuing in some ways the work of [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]. In the 1930s, inspired by his readings from [[Anatole France]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], he also published his celebrated \"Jewster Harrow\" stories, mocking the conventions of [[historical novel]]s and [[Renaissance literature]]. His career peaked in 1937, when he received one of Romania's most prestigious awards, the National Prize.\n\nTeodoreanu was employed as a propagandist during World War II, supporting Romania's participation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. From 1947, P\u0103storel was marginalized and closely supervised by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], making efforts to adapt his style and politics, then being driven into an ambiguous relationship with the [[Securitate]] secret police. Beyond this facade conformity, he contributed to the emergence of an underground, largely oral, [[anti-communist]] literature. In 1959, Teodoreanu was apprehended by the communist authorities, and prosecuted in a larger [[show trial]] of Romanian intellectual resistants. He spent some two years in prison, and reemerged as a conventional writer. He died shortly after, without having been fully [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]. His work was largely inaccessible to readers until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nThe Teodoreanu brothers were born to Sofia Muzicescu, wife of the lawyer Osvald Al.

Some exegetes have decoded proof of patriotic attachment in the writer's defense of [[Romanian cuisine]], and especially his ideas about [[Romanian wine]]. \u0218erban Cioculescu once described his friend as a \"wine nationalist\"<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 327; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref> and George C\u0103linescu suggested that P\u0103storel was entirely out of his element when discussing [[French wine]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p. 776</ref> On one hand, P\u0103storel supported illusory claims of Romanian precedence (including a story that [[caviar]] was discovered in Romania); on the other, he issued loving, if condescending, remarks about Romanians being a people of \"[[Grilling|grill cooks]] and ''[[m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103]]'' eaters\".<ref name=\"fpdestin22\"/> However, Teodoreanu was irritated by the contemplative traditionalism of Moldavian writers, and, as Cioculescu writes, his vitality clashed with the older schools of nationalism: [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' circle and \"its Moldavian pair\", [[Poporanism]].<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 320\u2013321</ref> Philosophically, he remained indebted to [[Oscar Wilde]] and the [[Aestheticism|aestheticists]].<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 297\u2013298; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref>\n\nThe [[frame story]] ''Hronicul M\u0103sc\u0103riciului V\u0103l\u0103tuc'' is, to at least some degree, an echo of \"national specificity\" guidelines, as set by ''Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103''.<ref>Costin, pp. 255\u2013256</ref> It is however also remembered as a most atypical contribution to [[Romanian literature]], and, critics argue, \"one of his most valuable books\",<ref>P\u00eerjol, p. 19</ref> a \"masterpiece\".<ref>Costin, pp. 255\u2013256; Hrimiuc, pp. 295, 311</ref> Nevertheless, the only commentator to have been impressed by the totality of ''Hronicul'', and to have rated P\u0103storel as one of Romania's greatest humorists, is the aestheticist [[Paul Zarifopol]].

Like the ''Contes'', Jester Harrow's tale reuses, and downgrades, the conventions of medieval [[historiography]]\u2014in P\u0103storel's text, the material for parody is [[Ion Neculce]]'s ''Letopise\u021bul \u021b\u0103r\u00e2i Moldovei''.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p. 776; Costin, pp. 256\u2013257; Hrimiuc, p. 317; Teodoreanu & Ruja, pp. 9\u201310</ref> As both the writer and his reviewers have noted, Teodoreanu mixed the subversive \"counterfeiting\" of Neculce's history into his own loving homage to the [[Moldavian subdialect of Romanian|Moldavian dialects]] and their verbal clich\u00e9s.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p. 776; Costin, pp. 255\u2013258; Teodoreanu & Ruja, p. 10</ref> Archaic Moldavian, he explained in a 1929 interview, was highly distinct from [[officialese]]; he related to it as \"the language I used to speak, but forgot\", the voicing of one's \"deep melancholy\".<ref>Costin, pp. 256\u2013258</ref> He specified his models: the Moldavian chroniclers, Neculce and [[Miron Costin]]; the modern [[pastiche]]s, Balzac's ''Contes'' and Anatole France's ''Merrie Tales of Jaques Tournebroche''.<ref>Costin, pp. 255\u2013258; Hrimiuc, p. 317; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref> In addition, literary historian [[Eugen Lovinescu]] believes, Teodoreanu was naturally linked to the common source of all modern parodies, namely the fantasy stories of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]. P\u0103storel's \"so very Rabelaisian\" writing has a \"thick, big, succulent note, that will saturate and overfill the reader.\"<ref>Lovinescu, p. 208</ref>\n\nA narrative experiment, ''Hronicul'' comprises at least five parody \"historical novels\", independent of each other: ''Spovedania Iancului'' (\"Iancu's Confession\"), ''Inelul Marghioli\u021bei'' (\"Marghioli\u021ba's Ring\"), ''Purs\u00e2ngele c\u0103pitanului'' (\"The Captain's Purebred\"), ''Cumplitul Tra\u0219c\u0103 Dr\u0103culescul'' (\"Tra\u0219c\u0103 the Terrible, of the [[House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti|Dracula Clan]]\"), and ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'' (\"Ko\ufb06akel ye Tirele\u017fs\"). In several editions, they are bound together with various other works, covering several literary genres. According to biographer Gheorghe Hrimiuc, the latter category is less accomplished than the \"chronicle\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 311\u2013312</ref> It notably includes various of Teodoreanu's attacks on Iorga.<ref>Gheme\u0219, p. 75</ref>\n\n====Particular episodes====\n[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1857) b 581.jpg|thumb|340px|Domestic scene of [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyardom]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]] (''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', 1857)]]\nAlthough the presence of anachronisms makes it hard to even locate the stories' time-frame, they seem to be generally referencing the 18th- and 19th-century [[Phanariotes|Phanariote era]], during which Romanians adopted a decadent, essentially anti-heroic, lifestyle.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 316\u2013317, 325\u2013326; Mironescu (2008), pp. 16, 17</ref> A recurrent theme is that of the colossal banquet, in most cases prompted by nothing other than the joy of company or a ''[[carpe diem]]'' mentality, but so excessive that they drive the organizers into moral and material bankruptcy.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 321\u2013326, 330\u2013332; Mironescu (2008), p. 17</ref> In all five episodes, P\u0103storel disguises himself as various [[unreliable narrator]]s. He is, for instance, a decrepit General Coban (''Purs\u00e2ngele c\u0103pitanului'') and a retired [[courtesan]] (''Inelul Marghioli\u021bei''). In ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'', a \"[[False document|found manuscript]]\", he has three narrative voices: that of the writer, Pantele; that of the skeptic reviewer, Balaban; and that of the concerned \"philologist\", with his absurd [[critical apparatus]] (a parody of scientific conventions).<ref>Costin, pp. 258\u2013263; Hrimiuc, pp. 312\u2013316, 321\u2013322, 329\u2013331; Mironescu (2008), ''passim''</ref> The [[alter ego]], \"Harrow\", is only present (and mentioned by name) in the rhyming ''Predoslovie'' (\"Foreword\"), but is implicit in all the stories.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 321\u2013322; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref>\n\nAlso in ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'', Teodoreanu's love for role-playing becomes a study in [[intertextuality]] and candid stupidity. Pantele is a reader of Miron Costin, but seemingly incapable of understanding his literary devices. He [[wikt:reification|reifies]] metaphoric accounts about a [[Moldavia|Moldavian Princedom]] \"flowing with milk and honey\": \"Had this been in any way true, people would be glued to fences, like flies\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 313\u2013315</ref> Even the protagonist, Ko\ufb06akel, is a writer, humorist and parodist, who has produced his own chronicle of \"obscenities\" with the stated purpose of irritating Ion Neculce (who thus makes a brief appearance ''within'' Harrow's \"chronicle\").<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 322. See also Costin, p. 265</ref> The [[deadpan]] critical apparatus accompanying such intertextual dialogues is there to divert attention from Teodoreanu's narrative tricks and anachronisms. Hrimiuc suggests that, by pretending to read his own \"chronicle\" as a valid historical record, P\u0103storel was sending in \"negative messages about how not to decode the work.\"<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 315\u2013316</ref>\n\n''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'' and ''Purs\u00e2ngele c\u0103pitanului'' comprise some of P\u0103storel's ideas about the Moldavian ethos. The locals have developed a strange mystical tradition, worshiping [[Gras\u0103 de Cotnari|Cotnari wine]], and regarding those who abstain from it as \"enemies of the church\".<ref>Costin, pp. 262\u2013265; Hrimiuc, pp. 326\u2013328</ref> The author also highlights the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Moldavian boyars]]' loose sexual mores: weak husbands are resigned cuckolds, [[Slavery in Romania|Romani slaves]] are used for staging sexual farces; however, as Zarifopol argues, this type of prose does not seek to be \"aphrodisiac\".<ref>Costin, pp. 265\u2013266</ref> The scenes of merrymaking are played out for a melancholy effect. In ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'', the [[antagonist]] is Panagake, an outsider ([[Greeks in Romania|Graeco-Romanian]]) and usurper of tradition. Although he suffers defeat and ridicule, he is there to announce that the era of joy is coming to a conclusion.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> As critic Doris Mironescu notes, characters experience an \"entry into time\", except \"theirs is not Great history, but a minor one, that of intimate disasters, of homemaking tragedies and the domestic hell.\"<ref>Mironescu (2008), p. 17</ref>\n \n''Hronicul'' satirizes the conventions of Romanian [[neoromanticism]] and of the commercial [[adventure novel]], or [[penny dreadful]], particularly so in ''Cumplitul Tra\u0219c\u0103 Dr\u0103culescul''.<ref>Costin, pp. 261, 264; Hrimiuc, pp. 316, 317\u2013321, 330</ref> The eponymous hero is a colossal and unpredictable [[hajduk]], born with the necessary [[Hamartia|tragic flaw]]. He lives in continuous erotic frenzy, pushing himself on all available women, \"without regard as to whether they were virgins or ripe women, not even if they had happened to be his cousins or his aunts\".<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 325</ref> Still, he is consumed by his passion for the nubile Sanda, but she dies, of \"chest trouble\", on the very night of their wedding. The broken Tra\u0219c\u0103 commits suicide on the spot. These events are narrated with the crescendo of romantic novels, leading to the unceremonious punch line: \"And it so happened that this Tra\u0219c\u0103 of the Draculas was ninety years of age.\"<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 318. See also Costin, pp. 264\u2013265; Lovinescu, p. 208; Mironescu (2008), p. 17</ref>\n\n===Caragialesque prose===\nTeodoreanu's ''Mici satisfac\u021bii'' and ''Un porc de c\u00e2ine'' echo the classical [[sketch stories]] of [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], a standard in [[Romanian humor]]. Like him, P\u0103storel looks into the puny lives and \"small satisfactions\" of Romania's ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'', but does not display either Caragiale's malice or his political agenda.<ref name=\"bccoresp\"/><ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 296\u2013301; Teodoreanu & Ruja, pp. 10\u201311</ref> His own specialty is the open-ended, unreliably-narrated, depiction of mundane events: the apparent suicide of a lapdog, or (in ''Berzele din Boureni'') an \"abstruse\" dispute about the flight patterns of storks.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 302\u2013304</ref>\n\n''Un porc de c\u00e2ine'' pushed the jokes a little further, risking to be branded an obscene work. According to critic [[Perpessicius]], \"a witty writer can never be an obscene writer\", and P\u0103storel had enough talent to stay out of the pornographic range.<ref>Teodoreanu & Ruja, p. 11</ref> Similarly, Cioculescu describes his friend as an artisan of \"libertine humor\", adverse to [[didactic art]], and interested only in \"pure comedy\".<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 308</ref> In his narrator's voice, P\u0103storel mockingly complains that the banal was being replaced by the outstanding, making it hard for humorists to find subject matters. Such doubts are dispelled by the intrusion of a blunt, but inspirational, topic: \"Can it be true that [[Anthemis arvensis|mayweed]] is an aphrodisiac?\"<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 306\u2013307</ref> In fact, ''Un porc de c\u00e2ine'' expands Teodoreanu's range beyond the everyday, namely by showing the calamitous, entirely unforeseeable, effects of an erotic farce.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 305\u2013306</ref> The volume also includes a faux [[obituary]], honoring the memory of one Nae Vasilescu. This stuttering tragedian, whose unredeemed ambition was to play [[Shylock]], took his revenge on the acting profession by becoming a real-life [[Usury|usurer]]\u2014an efficient if dishonorable way to earning the actors' fear and respect.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 308\u2013310</ref>\n\nCritics have rated Teodoreanu as a Caragialesque writer, or a \"Moldavian\", \"thicker\", more archaic Caragiale.<ref name=\"bccoresp\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu, pp. 776\u2013777; Teodoreanu & Ruja, p. 13</ref> Hrimiuc suggests that Caragiale has become an \"obligatory\" benchmark for Teodoreanu's prose, with enough differences to prevent P\u0103storel from seeming an \"epigone\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 296\u2013297, 300\u2013301</ref> Hrimiuc then notes that Teodoreanu is entirely himself in the sketch ''S-au sup\u0103rat profesorii'' (\"The Professors Are Upset\"), fictionalizing the birth of the [[National Liberal Party-Br\u0103tianu]] with \"mock dramaticism\", and in fact poking fun at the vague political ambitions of Moldavian academics.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 297, 299\u2013300</ref> As a Caragiale follower, Teodoreanu remained firmly within established genre. Doris Mironescu describes his enrollment as a flaw, placing him in the vicinity of \"minor\" Moldavian writers ([[I. I. Mironescu]], [[Dimitrie D. P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu]]),<ref name=\"dm16\">Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref> and noting that his \"obvious model\" was the memoirist [[Radu Rosetti]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Doris Mironescu, [http://www.suplimentuldecultura.ro/numarpdf/SDC_323_low-res.pdf \"Radu Rosetti, un cronicar al lumii vechi\"], in ''Suplimentul de Cultur\u0103'', Nr. 323, September 2011, p. 10</ref> The other main influence, as pinpointed by literary critics, remains Teodoreanu's personal hero, Anatole France.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 295\u2013296; P\u00eerjol, p. 20</ref> In ''T\u0103m\u00e2ie \u0219i otrav\u0103'', Teodoreanu is, like France, a moralist.

According to critics such as C\u0103linescu<ref name=\"gc779\">C\u0103linescu, p. 779</ref> and [[Alexandru Paleologu]], his main reference is [[Alexandru Macedonski]], the Romanian Symbolist master.

If their jokes had the same brevity,<ref name=\"dm16\"/> their humor was essentially different, in that Top\u00eerceanu preserved an innocent worldview.<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 298</ref> In this class of poetry, Teodoreanu had a noted preference for [[orality]], and, according to interwar essayist [[Petru Comarnescu]], was one of Romania's \"semi-failed intellectuals\", loquacious and improvident.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Andrei Stavil\u0103, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120227054436/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/STAVILAian5.html \"Eveniment: Jurnalul lui Petru Comarnescu\"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2005</ref> As an impish journalist, he always favored the ephemeral.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 292, 302</ref> P\u0103storel's work therefore includes many scattered texts, some of which were never collected for print. Gheorghe Hrimiuc assessed that his [[aphorism]]s, \"inscriptions\" and self-titled \"banal paradoxes\" must number in the dozens, while his [[epigram]] production was \"enormous\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 292\u2013293, 295</ref>\n\nIn his attacks on Nicolae Iorga, the epigrammatist P\u0103storel took the voice of [[Dante Aligheri]], about whom Iorga had written a play. Teodoreanu's Dante addressed his Romanian reviver, and kindly asked to be left alone.<ref>Cernat (2007), p. 152; Gheme\u0219, p. 73</ref> Anti-Iorga epigrams abound in ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'' pages. Attributable to Teodoreanu, they are signed with various irreverent pen names, all of them referencing Iorga's various activities and opinions: Iorgu Arghiropol-Buzatu, Hidalgo B\u0103rbulescu, Mi\u021ba Cursista, Nicu Modestie, Mic dela Pirandola.<ref>Gheme\u0219, pp. 73\u201375</ref> On the friendly side, the fashion of exchanging epigrams was also employed by Teodoreanu and his acquaintances. In one such jousting, with philosopher [[Constantin Noica]], Teodoreanu was ridiculed for overusing the [[apostrophe]] (and [[abbreviation]]) to regulate his prosody; Teodoreanu conceded that he could learn \"writing from Noica\".<ref>[[Gabriel Liiceanu]], ''The P\u0103ltini\u0219 Diary: A Paideic Model in Humanist Culture'', pp. 22\u201323.

O.) Teodoreanu'''; July 30, 1894 \u2013 March 17, 1964), was a Romanian humorist, poet and gastronome, the brother of novelist [[Ionel Teodoreanu]] and brother in law of writer [[\u0218tefana Velisar Teodoreanu]]. He worked in many genres, but is best remembered for his [[parody]] texts and his [[epigram]]s, and less so for his [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] verse. His roots planted in the regional culture of [[Western Moldavia]], which became his main source of literary inspiration, P\u0103storel was at once an opinionated columnist, famous wine-drinking [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], and decorated war hero. He worked with the influential literary magazines of the 1920s, moving between ''[[G\u00e2ndirea]]'' and ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', and cultivated complex relationships with literary opinion-makers such as [[George C\u0103linescu]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful but scandalous debut in drama, Teodoreanu perfected his work as a satirist, producing material which targeted the historian-politician [[Nicolae Iorga]] and the literary scholar [[Giorge Pascu]], as well as food criticism which veered into fantasy literature. As an affiliate of ''[[\u021aara Noastr\u0103]]'', he favored a brand of [[Romanian nationalism]] which ran against Iorga's own. Corrosive or contemplative, P\u0103storel's various [[Sketch story|sketches]] dealt with social and political issues of the interwar, continuing in some ways the work of [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]. In the 1930s, inspired by his readings from [[Anatole France]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], he also published his celebrated \"Jewster Harrow\" stories, mocking the conventions of [[historical novel]]s and [[Renaissance literature]]. His career peaked in 1937, when he received one of Romania's most prestigious awards, the National Prize.\n\nTeodoreanu was employed as a propagandist during World War II, supporting Romania's participation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. From 1947, P\u0103storel was marginalized and closely supervised by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], making efforts to adapt his style and politics, then being driven into an ambiguous relationship with the [[Securitate]] secret police. Beyond this facade conformity, he contributed to the emergence of an underground, largely oral, [[anti-communist]] literature. In 1959, Teodoreanu was apprehended by the communist authorities, and prosecuted in a larger [[show trial]] of Romanian intellectual resistants. He spent some two years in prison, and reemerged as a conventional writer. He died shortly after, without having been fully [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]. His work was largely inaccessible to readers until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nThe Teodoreanu brothers were born to Sofia Muzicescu, wife of the lawyer Osvald Al.

Some exegetes have decoded proof of patriotic attachment in the writer's defense of [[Romanian cuisine]], and especially his ideas about [[Romanian wine]]. \u0218erban Cioculescu once described his friend as a \"wine nationalist\"<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 327; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref> and George C\u0103linescu suggested that P\u0103storel was entirely out of his element when discussing [[French wine]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p. 776</ref> On one hand, P\u0103storel supported illusory claims of Romanian precedence (including a story that [[caviar]] was discovered in Romania); on the other, he issued loving, if condescending, remarks about Romanians being a people of \"[[Grilling|grill cooks]] and ''[[m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103]]'' eaters\".<ref name=\"fpdestin22\"/> However, Teodoreanu was irritated by the contemplative traditionalism of Moldavian writers, and, as Cioculescu writes, his vitality clashed with the older schools of nationalism: [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' circle and \"its Moldavian pair\", [[Poporanism]].<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 320\u2013321</ref> Philosophically, he remained indebted to [[Oscar Wilde]] and the [[Aestheticism|aestheticists]].<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 297\u2013298; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref>\n\nThe [[frame story]] ''Hronicul M\u0103sc\u0103riciului V\u0103l\u0103tuc'' is, to at least some degree, an echo of \"national specificity\" guidelines, as set by ''Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103''.<ref>Costin, pp. 255\u2013256</ref> It is however also remembered as a most atypical contribution to [[Romanian literature]], and, critics argue, \"one of his most valuable books\",<ref>P\u00eerjol, p. 19</ref> a \"masterpiece\".<ref>Costin, pp. 255\u2013256; Hrimiuc, pp. 295, 311</ref> Nevertheless, the only commentator to have been impressed by the totality of ''Hronicul'', and to have rated P\u0103storel as one of Romania's greatest humorists, is the aestheticist [[Paul Zarifopol]].

P\u0103storel's \"so very Rabelaisian\" writing has a \"thick, big, succulent note, that will saturate and overfill the reader.\"<ref>Lovinescu, p. 208</ref>\n\nA narrative experiment, ''Hronicul'' comprises at least five parody \"historical novels\", independent of each other: ''Spovedania Iancului'' (\"Iancu's Confession\"), ''Inelul Marghioli\u021bei'' (\"Marghioli\u021ba's Ring\"), ''Purs\u00e2ngele c\u0103pitanului'' (\"The Captain's Purebred\"), ''Cumplitul Tra\u0219c\u0103 Dr\u0103culescul'' (\"Tra\u0219c\u0103 the Terrible, of the [[House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti|Dracula Clan]]\"), and ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'' (\"Ko\ufb06akel ye Tirele\u017fs\"). In several editions, they are bound together with various other works, covering several literary genres. According to biographer Gheorghe Hrimiuc, the latter category is less accomplished than the \"chronicle\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 311\u2013312</ref> It notably includes various of Teodoreanu's attacks on Iorga.<ref>Gheme\u0219, p. 75</ref>\n\n====Particular episodes====\n[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1857) b 581.jpg|thumb|340px|Domestic scene of [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyardom]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]] (''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', 1857)]]\nAlthough the presence of anachronisms makes it hard to even locate the stories' time-frame, they seem to be generally referencing the 18th- and 19th-century [[Phanariotes|Phanariote era]], during which Romanians adopted a decadent, essentially anti-heroic, lifestyle.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 316\u2013317, 325\u2013326; Mironescu (2008), pp. 16, 17</ref> A recurrent theme is that of the colossal banquet, in most cases prompted by nothing other than the joy of company or a ''[[carpe diem]]'' mentality, but so excessive that they drive the organizers into moral and material bankruptcy.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 321\u2013326, 330\u2013332; Mironescu (2008), p. 17</ref> In all five episodes, P\u0103storel disguises himself as various [[unreliable narrator]]s. He is, for instance, a decrepit General Coban (''Purs\u00e2ngele c\u0103pitanului'') and a retired [[courtesan]] (''Inelul Marghioli\u021bei''). In ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'', a \"[[False document|found manuscript]]\", he has three narrative voices: that of the writer, Pantele; that of the skeptic reviewer, Balaban; and that of the concerned \"philologist\", with his absurd [[critical apparatus]] (a parody of scientific conventions).<ref>Costin, pp. 258\u2013263; Hrimiuc, pp. 312\u2013316, 321\u2013322, 329\u2013331; Mironescu (2008), ''passim''</ref> The [[alter ego]], \"Harrow\", is only present (and mentioned by name) in the rhyming ''Predoslovie'' (\"Foreword\"), but is implicit in all the stories.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 321\u2013322; Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref>\n\nAlso in ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'', Teodoreanu's love for role-playing becomes a study in [[intertextuality]] and candid stupidity. Pantele is a reader of Miron Costin, but seemingly incapable of understanding his literary devices. He [[wikt:reification|reifies]] metaphoric accounts about a [[Moldavia|Moldavian Princedom]] \"flowing with milk and honey\": \"Had this been in any way true, people would be glued to fences, like flies\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 313\u2013315</ref> Even the protagonist, Ko\ufb06akel, is a writer, humorist and parodist, who has produced his own chronicle of \"obscenities\" with the stated purpose of irritating Ion Neculce (who thus makes a brief appearance ''within'' Harrow's \"chronicle\").<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 322. See also Costin, p. 265</ref> The [[deadpan]] critical apparatus accompanying such intertextual dialogues is there to divert attention from Teodoreanu's narrative tricks and anachronisms. Hrimiuc suggests that, by pretending to read his own \"chronicle\" as a valid historical record, P\u0103storel was sending in \"negative messages about how not to decode the work.\"<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 315\u2013316</ref>\n\n''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'' and ''Purs\u00e2ngele c\u0103pitanului'' comprise some of P\u0103storel's ideas about the Moldavian ethos. The locals have developed a strange mystical tradition, worshiping [[Gras\u0103 de Cotnari|Cotnari wine]], and regarding those who abstain from it as \"enemies of the church\".<ref>Costin, pp. 262\u2013265; Hrimiuc, pp. 326\u2013328</ref> The author also highlights the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Moldavian boyars]]' loose sexual mores: weak husbands are resigned cuckolds, [[Slavery in Romania|Romani slaves]] are used for staging sexual farces; however, as Zarifopol argues, this type of prose does not seek to be \"aphrodisiac\".<ref>Costin, pp. 265\u2013266</ref> The scenes of merrymaking are played out for a melancholy effect. In ''Neobositul\u016d Kostakel\u016d'', the [[antagonist]] is Panagake, an outsider ([[Greeks in Romania|Graeco-Romanian]]) and usurper of tradition. Although he suffers defeat and ridicule, he is there to announce that the era of joy is coming to a conclusion.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> As critic Doris Mironescu notes, characters experience an \"entry into time\", except \"theirs is not Great history, but a minor one, that of intimate disasters, of homemaking tragedies and the domestic hell.\"<ref>Mironescu (2008), p. 17</ref>\n \n''Hronicul'' satirizes the conventions of Romanian [[neoromanticism]] and of the commercial [[adventure novel]], or [[penny dreadful]], particularly so in ''Cumplitul Tra\u0219c\u0103 Dr\u0103culescul''.<ref>Costin, pp. 261, 264; Hrimiuc, pp. 316, 317\u2013321, 330</ref> The eponymous hero is a colossal and unpredictable [[hajduk]], born with the necessary [[Hamartia|tragic flaw]]. He lives in continuous erotic frenzy, pushing himself on all available women, \"without regard as to whether they were virgins or ripe women, not even if they had happened to be his cousins or his aunts\".<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 325</ref> Still, he is consumed by his passion for the nubile Sanda, but she dies, of \"chest trouble\", on the very night of their wedding. The broken Tra\u0219c\u0103 commits suicide on the spot. These events are narrated with the crescendo of romantic novels, leading to the unceremonious punch line: \"And it so happened that this Tra\u0219c\u0103 of the Draculas was ninety years of age.\"<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 318. See also Costin, pp. 264\u2013265; Lovinescu, p. 208; Mironescu (2008), p. 17</ref>\n\n===Caragialesque prose===\nTeodoreanu's ''Mici satisfac\u021bii'' and ''Un porc de c\u00e2ine'' echo the classical [[sketch stories]] of [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], a standard in [[Romanian humor]]. Like him, P\u0103storel looks into the puny lives and \"small satisfactions\" of Romania's ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'', but does not display either Caragiale's malice or his political agenda.<ref name=\"bccoresp\"/><ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 296\u2013301; Teodoreanu & Ruja, pp. 10\u201311</ref> His own specialty is the open-ended, unreliably-narrated, depiction of mundane events: the apparent suicide of a lapdog, or (in ''Berzele din Boureni'') an \"abstruse\" dispute about the flight patterns of storks.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 302\u2013304</ref>\n\n''Un porc de c\u00e2ine'' pushed the jokes a little further, risking to be branded an obscene work. According to critic [[Perpessicius]], \"a witty writer can never be an obscene writer\", and P\u0103storel had enough talent to stay out of the pornographic range.<ref>Teodoreanu & Ruja, p. 11</ref> Similarly, Cioculescu describes his friend as an artisan of \"libertine humor\", adverse to [[didactic art]], and interested only in \"pure comedy\".<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 308</ref> In his narrator's voice, P\u0103storel mockingly complains that the banal was being replaced by the outstanding, making it hard for humorists to find subject matters. Such doubts are dispelled by the intrusion of a blunt, but inspirational, topic: \"Can it be true that [[Anthemis arvensis|mayweed]] is an aphrodisiac?\"<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 306\u2013307</ref> In fact, ''Un porc de c\u00e2ine'' expands Teodoreanu's range beyond the everyday, namely by showing the calamitous, entirely unforeseeable, effects of an erotic farce.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 305\u2013306</ref> The volume also includes a faux [[obituary]], honoring the memory of one Nae Vasilescu. This stuttering tragedian, whose unredeemed ambition was to play [[Shylock]], took his revenge on the acting profession by becoming a real-life [[Usury|usurer]]\u2014an efficient if dishonorable way to earning the actors' fear and respect.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 308\u2013310</ref>\n\nCritics have rated Teodoreanu as a Caragialesque writer, or a \"Moldavian\", \"thicker\", more archaic Caragiale.<ref name=\"bccoresp\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu, pp. 776\u2013777; Teodoreanu & Ruja, p. 13</ref> Hrimiuc suggests that Caragiale has become an \"obligatory\" benchmark for Teodoreanu's prose, with enough differences to prevent P\u0103storel from seeming an \"epigone\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 296\u2013297, 300\u2013301</ref> Hrimiuc then notes that Teodoreanu is entirely himself in the sketch ''S-au sup\u0103rat profesorii'' (\"The Professors Are Upset\"), fictionalizing the birth of the [[National Liberal Party-Br\u0103tianu]] with \"mock dramaticism\", and in fact poking fun at the vague political ambitions of Moldavian academics.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 297, 299\u2013300</ref> As a Caragiale follower, Teodoreanu remained firmly within established genre. Doris Mironescu describes his enrollment as a flaw, placing him in the vicinity of \"minor\" Moldavian writers ([[I. I. Mironescu]], [[Dimitrie D. P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu]]),<ref name=\"dm16\">Mironescu (2008), p. 16</ref> and noting that his \"obvious model\" was the memoirist [[Radu Rosetti]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Doris Mironescu, [http://www.suplimentuldecultura.ro/numarpdf/SDC_323_low-res.pdf \"Radu Rosetti, un cronicar al lumii vechi\"], in ''Suplimentul de Cultur\u0103'', Nr. 323, September 2011, p. 10</ref> The other main influence, as pinpointed by literary critics, remains Teodoreanu's personal hero, Anatole France.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 295\u2013296; P\u00eerjol, p. 20</ref> In ''T\u0103m\u00e2ie \u0219i otrav\u0103'', Teodoreanu is, like France, a moralist.

Of all Symbolist poets, his favorite was [[Paul Verlaine]],<ref name=\"ghh293\">Hrimiuc, p. 293</ref> whose poems he had memorized to perfection,<ref name=\"rmboema\"/><ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Al.

According to critics such as C\u0103linescu<ref name=\"gc779\">C\u0103linescu, p. 779</ref> and [[Alexandru Paleologu]], his main reference is [[Alexandru Macedonski]], the Romanian Symbolist master. Paleologu notes that P\u0103storel is the more \"lucid\" answer to Macedonski's unlimited \"[[Quixotism]]\".<ref>Teodoreanu & Ruja, pp. 13\u201314. See also Ciobanu, pp. 246\u2013247</ref> Together with the ''[[carpe diem]]'' invitation in ''Hronicul'', ''Caiet'' is an implicit celebration of life:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Mormintele ne-a\u0219teapt\u0103 cu gurile c\u0103scate\n\u0218i mergem to\u021bi spre ele pe-un drum sau pe alt drum,\nCum merg hipnotizate gazele de fum,\nSpre \u0219erpi cu solzi de aur \u0219i ochi de nestemate.}}<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 332</ref>\n|\nThe graves they do await us, open mouthed,\nAnd we head down to them, this way or any other,\nDown to the snakes with golden skin and gemstone eyes,\nHypnotized by them, inert, we are [[flue gas]]ses.}}\n\nTeodoreanu's contribution to Romanian poetry centers on an original series, ''C\u00e2ntec\u00e8le de ospiciu'' (\"Tiny Songs from a Hospice\"), written from the perspective of the dangerously insane. As C\u0103linescu notes, they require \"subtle humor\" from the reader.<ref name=\"gc779\"/> For instance, some veer into delirious monologues:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|S-a ascuns \u00een mine-un cal,\nR\u0103t\u0103cit de herghelie,\nC\u00e2nd \u00eel ad\u0103pa, pe mal...\n\u00cens\u0103 nimenea nu \u0219tie\nC\u0103 eu am \u00een mine-un cal.}}<ref name=\"gc779\"/>\n|\nI carry a horse inside me,\nOne that has escaped his farm\nWhen the herd was out to water...\nStill, nobody out there knows\nAbout that, the horse inside me.}}\n\n===Scattered texts and apocrypha===\nAs a poet of the mundane, Teodoreanu shared glory with the other ''Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103'' humorist, [[George Top\u00eerceanu]]. If their jokes had the same brevity,<ref name=\"dm16\"/> their humor was essentially different, in that Top\u00eerceanu preserved an innocent worldview.<ref>Hrimiuc, p. 298</ref> In this class of poetry, Teodoreanu had a noted preference for [[orality]], and, according to interwar essayist [[Petru Comarnescu]], was one of Romania's \"semi-failed intellectuals\", loquacious and improvident.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Andrei Stavil\u0103, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120227054436/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/STAVILAian5.html \"Eveniment: Jurnalul lui Petru Comarnescu\"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2005</ref> As an impish journalist, he always favored the ephemeral.<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 292, 302</ref> P\u0103storel's work therefore includes many scattered texts, some of which were never collected for print. Gheorghe Hrimiuc assessed that his [[aphorism]]s, \"inscriptions\" and self-titled \"banal paradoxes\" must number in the dozens, while his [[epigram]] production was \"enormous\".<ref>Hrimiuc, pp. 292\u2013293, 295</ref>\n\nIn his attacks on Nicolae Iorga, the epigrammatist P\u0103storel took the voice of [[Dante Aligheri]], about whom Iorga had written a play. Teodoreanu's Dante addressed his Romanian reviver, and kindly asked to be left alone.<ref>Cernat (2007), p. 152; Gheme\u0219, p. 73</ref> Anti-Iorga epigrams abound in ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'' pages. Attributable to Teodoreanu, they are signed with various irreverent pen names, all of them referencing Iorga's various activities and opinions: Iorgu Arghiropol-Buzatu, Hidalgo B\u0103rbulescu, Mi\u021ba Cursista, Nicu Modestie, Mic dela Pirandola.<ref>Gheme\u0219, pp. 73\u201375</ref> On the friendly side, the fashion of exchanging epigrams was also employed by Teodoreanu and his acquaintances. In one such jousting, with philosopher [[Constantin Noica]], Teodoreanu was ridiculed for overusing the [[apostrophe]] (and [[abbreviation]]) to regulate his prosody; Teodoreanu conceded that he could learn \"writing from Noica\".<ref>[[Gabriel Liiceanu]], ''The P\u0103ltini\u0219 Diary: A Paideic Model in Humanist Culture'', pp. 22\u201323.

Some of his works came with original drawings: illustrations by [[Ion Sava]] (for ''Strofe cu pelin de mai'');<ref name=\"rmboema\"/> a portrait of the writer, by [[\u0218tefan Dimitrescu]] (''Mici satisfac\u021bii''); and graphics by [[Ion Valentin Anestin]] (''Vin \u0219i ap\u0103'').<ref>Teodoreanu & Ruja, pp. 10, 14</ref> One of the first to borrow from ''Hronicul'' was [[George Lesnea]], the author of humorous poems about Moldavia's distant past,<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Ion B\u0103lu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/I_BALUap.html \"Prezen\u021ba discret\u0103 a lui George Lesnea\"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2002</ref> and a recipient of the Hanul Ancu\u021bei literary prize.<ref name=\"ccmitul\"/> A young author of the 1940s, [[\u0218tefan Baciu]], drew inspiration from both ''Gastronomice'' and ''Caiet'' in his own humorous verse.<ref>Popa, pp. 91, 93</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, when [[liberalization]] touched Romanian communism, most restrictions on Teodoreanu's work were lifted. Already in 1969, a retrial had cleared the path for his [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]].<ref name=\"fpdestin25\"/> 1972 was a breakthrough year in his recovery, with a selection of his poems and a new edition of ''Hronicul''; the latter was to become \"the most readily reedited\" Teodoreanu work, down to 1989.<ref>Teodoreanu & Ruja, pp. 15\u201316</ref> Prefacing the former, [[D.

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February

Street.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Queen Street South looking north to King Street]]\n\n===Early settlement===\nIn 1784, the land that the Ontario town of Berlin would later develop on was a 240,000 hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands. Many of the first farms were least four hundred acres in size.<ref name=\"whs pdf 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1930 |website=Waterloo Historical Society 1930 Annual Meeting |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |access-date=13 March 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233215/http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"kitchener.foundlocally.com\">{{cite web |url=http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm |title=Kitchener\u2013Waterloo Ontario History \u2013 To Confederation |accessdate=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525125004/http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The German Company, represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker, had acquired the land from previous owner Richard Beasley; he had gotten into financial difficulties after buying the land in 1796 from Joseph Brant who represented the Six Nations.

King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever.

It runs approximately east\u2013west through the northern section of downtown Kitchener. It was originally laid out and constructed in 1856 by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR), and after the GTR's acquisition of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]], the mainline through Kitchener became known informally as the \"North Main Line\" in contrast with the \"South Main Line\" through [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], both connecting [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto]]. Coming from the east, the [[Waterloo Spur]] diverges from the mainline and heads north through [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and ultimately to [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]. The spur was formerly owned by CN, but is now owned by the [[Region of Waterloo]] and leased to the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] (GEXR), a shortline freight railway.\n\n[[Kitchener station]] lies a short distance west along the track from the junction with the Waterloo Spur. The current station building dates from 1897 and is a heritage structure which is owned by [[Via Rail]], Canada's national passenger railway. Both Via Rail [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|''Corridor'']] service and [[GO Transit]] [[Kitchener line]] service are available at the station, the latter of which has its western terminus at the station. Via Rail service consists of two trains per day in each direction along the Toronto\u2013London\u2013Sarnia route; one westbound train terminates at [[Sarnia station|Sarnia]] while another terminates at [[London station (Ontario)|London]], while both eastbound trains terminate at [[Toronto Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |title=Toronto-London-Sarnia |access-date=8 March 2020 |publisher=[[Via Rail]]}}</ref> GO train service was originally extended to Kitchener in 2011 from its previous western terminus at [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]].<ref name=2011kitchenerline>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/2567786-go-trains-to-run-from-kitchener-to-toronto-in-2011/ |title=GO trains to run from Kitchener to Toronto in 2011 |date=13 November 2010 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> GO service began with two trains per direction per weekday,<ref name=2011kitchenerline /> but since its inception train frequency has gradually increased and as of early 2020 it stands at 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |publisher=[[GO Transit]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |title=Kitchener GO Train and Bus Schedule}}</ref> In 2017, [[Metrolinx]] (the parent agency of GO Transit) constructed a purpose-built train layover facility on Shirley Avenue to supplement its existing adapted layover facility, which was at capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |publisher=[[Metrolinx]] |website=Metrolinx Engage |title=Creating Connections in Waterloo Region |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile Kitchener benefits from increasingly frequent commuter-oriented GO service east to Toronto, intercity Via Rail service to the city has been largely unchanged for years, limiting its connectivity to [[Southwestern Ontario]] to the west.

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name=\"February 2015\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]], 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1914\u2013present{{efn|Daily maximum and minimum

hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands.

In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.\n\nMuch of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads.  [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area.  Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and several [[gristmill|grist-]] and [[saw mill|sawmills]] (most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, John and [[Abraham Erb]]'s grist- and sawmills and Eby's cider mill) were erected throughout the area.  Schneider built Berlin's first road, from his home to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper corner).  $1000 was raised by the settlers to extend the road from Walper corner to Huether corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the [[Huether Hotel]] now stands in the city of Waterloo; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing the project was denied.\n\nLater named the founder of Berlin, [[Benjamin Eby]] (made Mennonite preacher in 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1806 and purchased a large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin (named about 1830).

Other German-speaking immigrants from Europe arrived during the 1830s to 1850s, bringing with them their language, religion and cultural traditions. The German community became industrial and political leaders, and created a German-Canadian society unlike any other found in Canada at the time.

The Princess of Wales Chapter of the [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]] raised the $6,000 needed for the monument.<ref>[http://www.kpl.org/ref/gsr/trivia.html Kitchener Public Library Trivia Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513105151/http://www.kpl.org/ref/gsr/trivia.html |date=13 May 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:victoria-park-kitchener-lake.jpg|thumb|right|Victoria Park]]\n\nAnother significant beauty spot in the city is Rockway Gardens. Adjacent to the Rockway golf course, the gardens occupy a long narrow strip of land alongside King Street as it rushes down to meet the Conestoga Parkway and become Highway 8. Here there are many fountains, ponds, waterfalls and rock grottoes. It is a popular site for wedding photos in the summer.\n\nKitchener has an extensive and safe community trail system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This convenient access to the Grand River has drawn nature-seeking tourists to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |title=Staff report regarding state of Kitchener's park system |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316205637/http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a bike park at the newly constructed McLennan Park, in the city's south end, was hailed as one of the best city-run bike parks in [[Southern Ontario]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/565847 |title=TheRecord \u2013 21 Rosedene Avenue |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> by [[Freestyle BMX|BMX]] and [[mountain biking]] enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |title=Take the Lane: Kitchener's new bike park |publisher=Therecord.blogs.com |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708021409/http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The bike park offers a [[Four-cross|four-cross (4X)]] section, a [[Freestyle BMX|pump track]] section, a [[Dirt jumping|jump park]], and a [[Flatland BMX|free-ride]] course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184531/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> McLennan Park also features an accessible play area, a splash pad, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, a leash-free dog area, and a toboggan hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |title=City of Kitchener \u2013 McLennan Park |publisher=City of Kitchener |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729151656/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Chicopee Ski Club]] is also within the city limits.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Highways and expressways===\n[[File:Highway 401 Grand River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] in Kitchener looking east towards the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]]]\n[[File:Conestoga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]] as seen from Franklin Street bridge]]\nKitchener was very proactive and visionary about its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking at that time construction of the [[Conestoga Parkway]] from the western boundary (just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo.\nSubsequent upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St Jacobs]], with eight lanes through its middle stretch.\n\nThe Conestoga Parkway bears the provincial highway designations of Highways [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|7]] and [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|8]]. King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides the \"east\" and \"west\" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest orientation itself.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|GRT iXpress bus (since adapted into the ION bus service)]]\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.

A. Macedonski''', '''Macedonschi''' or '''Macedonsky'''; March 14, 1854 \u2013 November 24, 1920) was a [[Romania]]n poet, novelist, dramatist and literary critic, known especially for having promoted French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] in his native country, and for leading the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]] during its early decades. A forerunner of local [[modernist literature]], he is the first local author to have used [[free verse]], and claimed by some to have been the first in modern [[European literature]]. Within the framework of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Macedonski is seen by critics as second only to [[List of national poets|national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]]; as leader of a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] trend formed around his ''[[Literatorul]]'' journal, he was diametrically opposed to the inward-looking traditionalism of Eminescu and his school.\n\nDebuting as a [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantic]] in the [[Wallachia]]n tradition, Macedonski went through the [[Literary realism|Realist]]-[[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] stage deemed \"social poetry\", while progressively adapting his style to Symbolism and [[Parnassianism]], and repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempting to impose himself in the [[Francophone]] world. Despite having theorized \"instrumentalism\", which reacted against the traditional guidelines of poetry, he maintained a lifelong connection with [[Neoclassicism]] and its ideal of purity. Macedonski's quest for excellence found its foremost expression in his recurring motif of life as a [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], notably used in his critically acclaimed ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle. The stylistic stages of his career are reflected in the collections ''[[Prima verba]]'', ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poezii]]'', and ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'', as well as in the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novel]] ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]''. In old age, he became the author of [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]], noted for their detached and serene vision of life, in contrast with his earlier combativeness.\n\nIn parallel to his literary career, Macedonski was a civil servant, notably serving as [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] in the [[Budjak]] and [[Northern Dobruja]] during the late 1870s. As journalist and militant, his allegiance fluctuated between the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] and [[conservatism]], becoming involved in polemics and controversies of the day. Of the long series of publications he founded, ''Literatorul'' was the most influential, notably hosting his early conflicts with the ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society. These targeted [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and especially Eminescu, their context and tone becoming the cause of a major rift between Macedonski and his public. This situation repeated itself in later years, when Macedonski and his ''[[For\u021ba Moral\u0103]]'' magazine began campaigning against the ''Junimist'' dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], whom they falsely accused of [[plagiarism]]. During [[World War I]], the poet aggravated his critics by supporting the [[Central Powers]] against Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]]. His biography was also marked by an enduring interest in [[esotericism]], numerous attempts to become recognized as an inventor, and an enthusiasm for [[cycling]].\n\nThe scion of a political and aristocratic family, the poet was the son of [[Alexandru D. Macedonski|General Alexandru Macedonski]], who served as [[Ministry of Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]], and the grandson of [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|1821 rebel]] [[Dimitrie Macedonski]]. Both his son [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] and grandson [[Soare Macedonski|Soare]] were known painters.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and family===\n[[File:Macedonski Rondelul trecutului.png|thumb|260px|Manuscript version for one of Macedonski's late poems, referencing his family's estates on the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia Valley]]]]\n\nThe poet's paternal family had arrived in [[Wallachia]] during the early 19th century.

Vianu (Vol.II, p.333) places emphasis on \"[Macedonski's] soul [...] where so many of his ancestors' instincts resided.\"</ref> Vianu's contemporary, literary historian [[George C\u0103linescu]], postulated that, although the family had been absorbed into the ethnic and cultural majority, the poet's origin served to enrich [[Culture of Romania|local culture]] by linking it to a \"[[Thracians|Thracian]]\" tradition and the spirit of \"adventurers\".<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.517, 974, 976</ref>\n\nThe family moved often, following General Macedonski's postings.

In 1874, back in Craiova, Macedonski founded a short-lived literary society known as ''Junimea'', a title which purposefully or unwittingly copied that of the influential [[Junimea|conservative association]] with whom he would later quarrel.<ref>Anghelescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol.II, p.346</ref> It was then that he met journalist and pedagogue [[\u0218tefan Velescu]], a meeting witnessed by Velescu's pupil, the future liberal journalist [[Constantin Bacalba\u0219a]], who recorded it in his [[memoir]]s.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.345</ref> ''Oltul'' magazine, which he had helped establish and which displayed a liberal agenda, continued to be published until July 1875, and featured Macedonski's translations from [[Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger]], [[Hector de Charlieu]] and [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], as well as his debut in [[travel writing]] and short story.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.345, 419</ref> At age 22, he worked on his first play, a [[comedy]] titled ''Gemenii'' (\"The Twins\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.452</ref> In 1874 that he came to the attention of young journalist future dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], who [[Satire|satirized]] him in articles for the magazine ''[[Ghimpele]]'', ridiculing his claim to Lithuanian descent, and eventually turning him into the character ''Aamsky'', whose fictional career ends with his death from exhaustion caused by contributing to \"for the country's political development\".<ref>Cioculescu, p.52-53</ref> This was the first episode in a consuming polemic between the two figures. Reflecting back on this period in 1892, Macedonski described Caragiale as a \"noisy young man\" of \"[[Sophistry|sophistic]] reasoning\", whose target audience was to be found in \"[[beer garden]]s\".<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.177</ref>\n\n===1875 trial and office as prefect===\n[[File:Al.

Supported by the liberal press and defended by the most prestigious pro-liberal attorneys ([[Nicolae Fleva]] among them), Macedonski faced a jury trial on June 7, being eventually cleared of the charges.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347; Sandqvist, p.197. According to Vianu, the court also ruled out that Macedonski's arrest had been rendered void by the [[statute of limitations]].</ref> Reportedly, the Bucharest populace organized a spontaneous celebration of the verdict.<ref>Anghelescu, p.9; C\u0103linescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347</ref>\n\nIn 1875, after the National Liberal [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]] was assigned the post of Premier by Carol, Macedonski embarked on an administrative career.

In parallel, he published his first translation, a version of ''[[Parisina]]'', an 1816 [[epic poem]] by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.349\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.349</ref> and completed the original works ''Ithalo'' and ''Calul arabului'' (\"The Arab's Horse\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.347, 349</ref> He also spoke at the [[Romanian Atheneum]], presenting his views on the state of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] (1878).<ref>Anghelescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol.II, p.349-350</ref> His time in office ended upon the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]]. At the time, Russian volunteers were amassed on the Budjak border, requesting from the Romanian authorities the right of free passage into the [[Principality of Serbia]]. The National Liberal Premier [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]], who was negotiating an anti-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] alliance, sent Macedonski signals to let them pass, but the prefect, obeying the official recommendation of [[Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Internal Affairs Minister]] [[George D. Vernescu]], decided against it, and was consequently stripped of his office.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.519\" />\n\nStill determined to pursue a career in the press, Macedonski founded a string of unsuccessful magazines with [[Patriotism|patriotic]] content and titles such as ''Vestea'' (\"The Announcement\"), ''Dun\u0103rea'' (\"The [[Danube]]\"), ''Fulgerul'' (\"The Lightning\") and, after 1880, ''Tarara'' (an [[onomatopoeia]] equivalent to \"Toodoodoo\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.348, 350-351</ref> Their history is connected with that of the Russo-Turkish War, at the end of which Romanian participation on the Russian side resulted in her independence.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.348\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.348</ref> Macedonski remained committed to the anti-Ottoman cause, and, some thirty years later, stated: \"We want no [[Rumelia|Turkey in Europe]]!\"<ref name=\"elrseisl\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Eugen Lungu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080820172941/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20020709 \"Islamul la noi acas\u0103.

Vianu notes that changes took place in the poet's relationship with his public: \"Society recognizes in him the nonconformist. [...] The man becomes singular; people start talking about his oddities.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.350</ref> Macedonski's presumed frustration at being perceived in this way, Vianu notes, may have led him closer to the idea of ''[[po\u00e8te maudit]]'', theorized earlier by [[Paul Verlaine]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.350, 360-361</ref> In this context, he had set his sight on promoting \"social poetry\", the merger between [[lyricism]] and political militantism.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.515-516, 523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.343, 351</ref> Meanwhile, according to C\u0103linescu, his attacks on the liberals and the \"daft insults he aimed at [Romania's] throne\" had effectively ruined his own chance of political advancement.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.519\" />\n\nIn January 1880, he launched his most influential and long-lived publication, ''[[Literatorul]]'', which was also the focal point of his [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] cultural circle, and, in later years, of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist school]]. In its first version, the magazine was co-edited by Macedonski, Bonifaciu Florescu and poet [[Th. M. Stoenescu]].<ref>Ornea, p.301; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351</ref> Florescu parted with the group soon after, due to a disagreement with Macedonski, and was later attacked by the latter for allegedly accumulating academic posts.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.529\">C\u0103linescu, p.529</ref> ''Literatorul'' aimed to irritate ''Junimist'' sensibilities from its first issue, when it stated its dislike for \"political prejudice in literature.\"<ref>Ornea, p.301</ref> This was most likely an allusion to the views of ''Junimist'' figure [[Titu Maiorescu]], being later accompanied by explicit attacks on him and his followers.<ref>Ornea, p.301-302</ref> An early success for the new journal was the warm reception it received from [[Vasile Alecsandri]], a Romantic poet and occasional ''Junimist'' whom Macedonski idolized at the time, and the collaboration of popular memoirist [[Gheorghe Sion]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.351\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.351</ref> Another such figure was the intellectual [[V.

Among the group of contributors, several had already been victims of Maiorescu's irony: Sion, Urechia, Pantazi Ghica and [[Petru Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu]].<ref>Ornea, p.302-303</ref> While welcoming the debut of its contributor, [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]]-[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] novelist and poet [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.351\"/> Macedonski repeatedly attacked its main exponent, the conservative poet Eminescu, claiming not to understand his poetry.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-355. According to Vianu (Vol.II, p.355), [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] also joined in the attack, using ''Literatorul'' for articles where his rival Eminescu was being criticized on various grounds, and signing them with the pseudonym ''Rienzi''.</ref> However, ''Literatorul'' was also open to contributions from some ''Convorbiri Literare'' affiliates (Zamfirescu, [[Matilda Cugler-Poni]] and [[Veronica Micle]]).<ref>Ornea, p.303</ref>\n\nIn November 1880, Macedonski's plays ''Iade\u0219!'' (\"Wishbone!\", a comedy first printed in 1882) and ''Unchia\u0219ul S\u0103r\u0103cie'' (\"Old Man Poverty\") premiered at the [[National Theater Bucharest]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 452</ref> A sign of government approval, this was followed by Macedonski's appointment to a minor administrative office, as Historical Monuments Inspector.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519; Sandqvist, p.197; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 361</ref> Nevertheless, both plays failed to impose themselves on public perception, and were withdrawn from the program by 1888.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.462\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.462</ref> C\u0103linescu asserts that, although Macedonski later claimed to have always been facing poverty, his job in the administration, coupled with other sources of revenue, ensured him a comfortable existence.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519-520</ref>\n\nIn 1881, Macedonski published a new collection of poetry. Titled ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poezii]]'', it carries the year \"1882\" on its original cover.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 394</ref> Again moving away from liberalism, Macedonski sought to make himself accepted by ''Junimea'' and Maiorescu.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.356-357</ref> He consequently attended the ''Junimea'' sessions, and gave a public reading of ''Noaptea de noiembrie'' (\"November Night\"), the first publicized piece in his lifelong ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; Ornea, p.304-305; Vianu, Vol.I, p.54; Vol.II, p.356</ref> It reportedly earned him the praise of historian and poet [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], who, although an anti-''Junimist'', happened to be in the audience.<ref>Anghelescu, p.16; Vianu, Vol.I, p.54</ref> Despite rumors according to which he had applauded Macedonski, Maiorescu himself was not impressed, and left an unenthusiastic account of the event in his private diary.<ref>Anghelescu, p.16; Perpessicius, p.246; Ornea, p.304</ref>\n\n===Against Alecsandri and Eminescu===\nMacedonski's open conflict with ''Junimea'' began in 1882, when he engaged in a publicized polemic with Alecsandri.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.296; Vianu, Vol.II, p.350-352</ref> It was ignited when, through Macedonski's articles, ''Literatorul'' criticized Alecsandri for accepting [[Romanian Academy]] prizes despite being its member,<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.296; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351-352</ref> and later involved Sion (whose replies on behalf of the Academy were derided by Macedonski).<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.351-352</ref> Macedonski also took distance from Alecsandri's style, publishing a \"critical analysis\" of his poetry in one issue of ''Literatorul''.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10</ref> In turn, Alecsandri humiliated his young rival by portraying him as [[Zoilus]], the prototype of slanderers, and himself as the model poet [[Horace]] in the 1883 play ''[[F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Blanduziei]]''.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.316; Vianu, Vol.II, p.352-353</ref> The two were eventually reconciled, and Macedonski again spoke of Alecsandri as his ideological and stylistic predecessor.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.353\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.353</ref>\n\nIn April 1882, Eminescu had also replied to Macedonski in ''[[Timpul]]'' journal, referring to an unnamed poet who \"barely finishes high-school, comes over to Bucharest selling nick-nacks and makeup [and goes into] literary dealership\". Reproaching Macedonski's attacks on Alecsandri, Eminescu makes a [[nationalism|nationalist]] comment about the young poet bearing \"the bastard instincts of those foreigners who were [[Romanianization|Romanianized]] only yesterday\", and attributes him \"the physiognomy of a hairdresser\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.357. Vianu believes that Macedonski had not authored any of the anti-Eminescu articles before that date.</ref> Through the articles of [[Petru Th. Missir]], ''Convorbiri Literare'' gave ''Poezii'' a negative review, deemed \"malevolent\" by literary historian [[Mircea Anghelescu]].<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.15\">Anghelescu, p.15</ref> At the other end of the political and cultural spectrum, Macedonski faced opposition from the intellectuals attracted to [[socialism]], in particular ''[[Contemporanul]]'' editors [[Constantin Mille]] and [[Ioan N\u0103dejde]], with whom he was engaged in an extended polemic.<ref>Anghelescu, p.15; Perpessicus, p.138-139, 266, 352</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, Macedonski published his own play, which had Cuza for its main character and was eponymously titled ''Cuza-Vod\u0103'',<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.462\"/> and completed translations for ''Literatorul''\u2014from [[Maurice Rollinat]], whom he helped impose as a main cultural reference in Romanian Symbolism, and from the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Akhillefs Paraskhos]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.296-299; Vol.III, p.385-386</ref> In 1883, he also contributed his first [[sketch story]], ''Casa cu nr. 10'' (\"The House at Number 10\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.420-421</ref> In early 1883, he married Ana Rallet-Sl\u0103tineanu.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.519; Nastas\u0103, p.106; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353</ref> Wealthy and supposedly related to Romanian aristocrats,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519; Nastas\u0103, p.106-107</ref> she would bear him five children in all: the painter [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] was the eldest, followed by Nikita; the three youngest were two sons (Panel and Constantin Macedonski) and a daughter, Anna (also known as Nina).<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.522</ref> His heterosexual lifestyle notwithstanding, Macedonski remained a self-avowed admirer of male beauties, and was rumored to be a closeted homosexual.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/>\n\nIn July 1883, Macedonski undertook one of his most controversial anti-''Junimist'' actions. That month, ''Literatorul'' published an [[epigram]] signed with the pseudonym ''Duna'',<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.353\"/> deriding an unnamed author who had lost his mind. Mihai Eminescu\u2014whom many had already come to see as Romania's [[List of national poets|national poet]]\u2014had by then developed a [[mental disorder]] which had become known to the general public. Ever since that moment, Macedonski has generally been believed to be ''Duna'', and as a result, was faced with much criticism from both readers and commentators.<ref name=\"vztcron\"/><ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.519, 520-521; Cernat, p.10; Perpessicius, p.138-139, 266, 352; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-361, 387</ref> The intense anti-''Literatorul'' press campaign was initiated in August, when writer [[Grigore Ventura]] issued an article condemning Macedonski's attitude (published in the Bucharest-based newspaper ''[[L'Ind\u00e9pendance Roumaine]]''), with Macedonski responding in the National Liberal organ ''[[Rom\u00e2nul]]''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.358-360</ref> During one evening, Macedonski is reported to have been assaulted by anonymous supporters of Eminescu.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.359</ref> His previous conflict with N\u0103dejde was also affected by this renewed controversy: while opposed to ''Junimist'' policies, the socialists at ''Contemporanul'' voiced their admiration for Eminescu's art.<ref>Perpessicus, p.138-139, 266, 352</ref>\n\nLate in 1883, Macedonski and his friends unveiled [[Ion Georgescu]]'s statue of their mentor Bolintineanu in the National Theater lobby. The circumstances in which this took place rose suspicion of foul play; on this grounds, Macedonski was ridiculed by his former friend Zamfirescu in the journal ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103]]'', which left him embittered.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.533; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-354, 391</ref> C\u0103linescu proposes that, although such negative reactions were invoked by Macedonski's supporters as a sign of their mentor having been marginalized, Macedonski had expressed his dissatisfaction with the cultural environment long before that moment, and was still a respected figure even after the incidents took place.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519-520, 521</ref>\n\n===First Paris sojourn and ''Poezia viitorului''===\n[[File:Le Vaisseau fant\u00f4me Macedonski L'\u00c9lan litt\u00e9raire.PNG|thumb|260px|Macedonski's poem ''Le Vaisseau fant\u00f4me'' (\"The Phantom Ship\"), as originally published in ''[[L'\u00c9lan litt\u00e9raire]]'' (February 1885)]]\n\nHaving been stripped of his administrative office by the new Br\u0103tianu cabinet,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.360-361</ref> Macedonski faced financial difficulties, and was forced to move into a house on the outskirts of Bucharest, and later moved between houses in northern Bucharest.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.520-521, 523</ref> According to C\u0103linescu, the poet continued to cultivate luxury and passionately invested in the [[decorative arts]], although his source of income, other than the supposed assistance \"of [European] ruling houses\", remains a mystery.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.522-523</ref> Arguing that Macedonski was \"always in need of money\" to use on his luxury items, poet [[Victor Eftimiu]] claimed: \"He did not shy away from sending emphatic notes to the potentates of his day [...], flattering some, threatening others.

In addition to his admiration for Cuza and the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Wallachian revolutionaries]], the poet objected to the King's sympathy for France's main rival, the [[German Empire]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.363, 366</ref> In January 1885, after having returned from the voyage, he announced his retirement from public life, claiming that German influence and its exponents at ''Junimea'' had \"conquered\" [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]],<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.362</ref> and repeating his claim that Eminescu lacked value.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.521\">C\u0103linescu, p.521</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, ''Literatorul'' went out of print, although new series were still published at irregular intervals until 1904 (when it ceased being published altogether).<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.362-363, 365, 366-367, 371-372, 376</ref> The magazine was reportedly hated by the public, causing Macedonski, Stoenescu, Florescu, Urechia and educator [[Anghel Demetriescu]] to try to revive it as ''Revista Literar\u0103'' (\"The Literary Review\", published for a few months in 1885).<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.516, 520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.363</ref> The poet attempted to establish other magazines, all of them short-lived, and, in 1887, handed for print his [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] [[novella]] ''Dram\u0103 banal\u0103'' (\"Banal Drama\")<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.421\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.421</ref> while completing one of the most revered episodes in the ''Nights'' series, ''Noaptea de mai'' (\"May Night\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.363\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.363</ref> Also in 1886, he worked on his other Naturalist novellas: ''Zi de august'' (\"August Day\"), ''Pe drum de po\u0219t\u0103'' (\"On the Stagecoach Trail\"), ''Din carnetul unui dezertor'' (\"From the Notebook of a Deserter\"), ''\u00centre cote\u021be'' (\"Amidst Hen Houses\") and the eponymous ''Nicu Dereanu''.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.421\"/>\n\nBy 1888, he was again sympathetic toward Blaremberg, whose dissident National Liberal faction had formed an alliance with the Conservatives, editing ''Stindardul \u021a\u0103rei'' (later ''Straja \u021a\u0103rei'') as his supporting journal.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.364-365</ref> However, late in the same year, he returned to the liberal mainstream, being assigned a weekly column in ''Rom\u00e2nul'' newspaper.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.365\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.365</ref> Two years later, he attempted to relaunch ''Literatorul'' under the leadership of liberal figure [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], but the latter eventually settled for founding his own ''[[Revista Nou\u0103]]''.<ref>Anghelescu, p.11</ref> Around 1891, he saluted ''Junimea''{{'}}s own break with the Conservatives and its entry into politics at the Conservative-Constitutional Party, before offering an enthusiastic welcome to the 1892 ''Junimist'' agitation among university students.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.365\"/> In 1894, he would speak in front of student crowds gathered at a political rally in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]], and soon after made himself known for supporting the cause of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] and other underrepresented groups of [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.367\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.367</ref>\n\nHis literary thesis of the time was titled ''Poezia viitorului'' (\"The Poetry of the Future\").

Stoenescu]] convinced himself that Caragiale was being framed, and refused to allow ''Revista Literar\u0103'' to be used for endorsing Caion, which caused Macedonski to shun him.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.374, 391</ref> Macedonski refused to withdraw his support for the cause even after Caragiale sued Caion, but ''For\u021ba Moral\u0103'' soon went out of print.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.374-376</ref> Before it did so, the journal hosted some of Macedonski's most renowned poems, including ''Lewki'' and ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' (\"December Night\"),<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.375-376</ref> together with his article on [[Remy de Gourmont]]'s thoughts on [[poetics]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.413-414</ref>\n\nIn his article of 1903, titled ''{{lang|ro|Spre ocultism.

Vianu, who visited the poet together with Pillat, compares this atmosphere with those created by other \"mystics and magi of poetry\" (citing as examples [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]], [[Louis-Nicolas M\u00e9nard]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Stefan George]]).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.III, p.352\"/> The hall where seances were hosted was only lit by candles, and the tables were covered in red fabric.<ref name=\"vztcron\" /><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.III, p.352</ref> Macedonski himself was seated on a throne designed by Alexis, and adopted a dominant pose.<ref name=\"vztcron\" /><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.522-523; Sandqvist, p.25, 199</ref> The apparent secrecy and the [[initiation rite]]s performed on new members were purportedly inspired by [[Rosicrucianism]] and the [[Freemasonry]].<ref>Krasztev, \"From a Deadlocked Present...\", p.42-43; Sandqvist, p.199-200</ref> By then, Macedonski was rewarding his followers' poems with false [[gemstone]]s.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Cernat, p.43; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.25, 200</ref>\n\nThe poet founded ''Revista Critic\u0103'' (\"The Critical Review\"), which again closed after a short while, and issued the poetry volume ''[[Flori sacre]]'' (\"Sacred Flowers\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.380-381</ref> Grouping his ''For\u021ba Moral\u0103'' poems and older pieces, it was dedicated to his new generation of followers, whom Macedonski's preface referred to as \"the new Romania.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.380</ref> He continued to hope that ''Le Fou?'' was going to be staged in France, especially after he received some encouragement in the form of articles in ''Mercure de France'' and ''Journal des D\u00e9bats'', but was confronted with the general public's indifference.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.381\"/> In 1914, ''Thalassa'' was published in a non-definitive version by [[Constantin Banu]]'s magazine ''[[Flac\u0103ra]]'',<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382, 440; Vol.III, p.353</ref> which sought to revive overall interest in his work.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.690</ref> At a [[French Red Cross]] conference in September, Macedonski paid his final public homage to France, which had just become entangled in [[World War I]].<ref>Boia, p.245</ref> It was also in 1914 that Macedonski commissioned for print his very first [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]] and completed work on a tragedy play about [[Renaissance]] poet [[Dante Aligheri]]\u2014known as ''La Mort de Dante'' in its French original, and ''Moartea lui Dante'' in the secondary Romanian version (both meaning \"Dante's Death\").<ref>Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382</ref> The aging poet was by then building connections with the [[Art of Romania|local art scene]]: together with artist [[Alexandru Severin]], he created (and probably presided over) ''Cenaclul idealist'' (\"The [[Idealism|Idealist]] Club\"), which included Symbolist artists and was placed under the honorary patronage of King Carol.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Marian Constantin, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Visuri-si-himere*articleID_21773-articles_details.html \"Visuri \u0219i himere\"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 474, May 2009</ref>\n\n1916 was also the year when Romania abandoned her neutrality and, under a National Liberal government, rallied with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. During the neutrality period, Macedonski had shed his lifelong Francophilia to join the [[Germanophile]]s, who wanted to see Romanian participation on the [[Central Powers]]' side.<ref name=\"vztcron\" /><ref>Boia, p.103, 104, 245-248; C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382-383</ref> In 1915, he issued the journal ''Cuv\u00e2ntul Meu'' (\"My Word\").

Alexis was drafted and became a war artist,<ref>Gheorghe Nicolescu, \"Imortaliz\u00eend eroii de la M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti, M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti, Oituz\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', August 1977, p.24-25</ref> but Macedonski Sr, who received formal protection from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest]],<ref>Boia, p.246</ref> chose to stay behind while the authorities and many ordinary citizens relocated to [[Ia\u0219i]], where resistance was still being organized. His stance was interpreted as [[collaborationism]] by his critics. However, Macedonski reportedly faced extreme poverty throughout the occupation.<ref name=\"vztcron\" /><ref>Boia, p.246; Cernat, p.45; Vianu, Vol.II, p.383</ref> Having by then begun to attend the circle of [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti]], his promoter and fellow Germanophile, he was once rewarded by the latter with a turkey filled with gold coins.<ref>Cernat, p.45</ref>\n\n===Late polemics, illness and death===\n[[File:Mormant Macedonski.jpg|thumb|Macedonski's grave in [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu]]]]\n\n''Literatorul'' resumed print in June 1918, once Romania capitulated to the Central Powers under the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.383-384</ref> A controversial incident occurred soon afterwards, when, going against the counsel of his friend and collaborator Stamatiad, Macedonski signed a ''Literatorul'' article where the German military administrator [[August von Mackensen]], who was about to lead his troops out of Romania, was presented in a positive light.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.383-384, 387. See also Boia, p.246-247</ref> In a manner deemed \"excessive\" by historian [[Lucian Boia]], the Romanian writer was paying homage not just to Mackensen, but also, indirectly, to [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and the ''[[German Army (German Empire)|Reichsheer]]''.<ref>Boia, p.246-247</ref> Soon after reading the piece, [[Romanian Academy]] member and fellow Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]] withdrew his own nomination of Macedonski for an Academy seat.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.384\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.384</ref> During summer, Macedonski also joined the group of public figures who saluted the senior Conservative Germanophile [[Petre P. Carp]] (deeming Carp \"the veteran of character, honesty and Romanianism\"), and, in September, joined [[Ioan Slavici]] and [[Gala Galaction]] as a contributor to the occupation magazine ''Rum\u00e4nien in Wort und Bild'', where he prophesied an [[Francophobia|anti-French]] \"political renaissance\" of Romania.<ref>Boia, p.247</ref>\n\nAlexandru Macedonski faced problems after the Romanian government resumed its control over Bucharest, and during the early years of [[Greater Romania]]. What followed the Mackensen article, Vianu claims, was Macedonski's ''bellum contra omnes'' (\"war against all\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.384\"/> However, the poet made efforts to accommodate himself with the triumphal return of the Ia\u0219i authorities: in December 1918, ''Literatorul'' celebrated the extension of Romanian rule \"from the [[Tisza]] to the [[Dniester]]\" as a success of the National Liberals, paying homage to Francophile political leaders [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] and [[Take Ionescu]].<ref>Boia, p.248</ref> Macedonski also envisaged running in the [[1918 Romanian general election|1918 election]] for a seat in the new [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] (which was supposed to vote a document to replace the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]] as the organic law), but never registered his candidature.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.384</ref> According to Vianu, he had intended to create a [[joke political party]], the \"intellectual group\", whose other member was an unnamed coffeehouse acquaintance of his.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.392</ref> ''Literatorul'' was revived for a final time in 1919.<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.13\"/>\n\nHis health deteriorated from [[heart disease]], which is described by Vianu as an effect of constant smoking.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.393. See also Suciu, p.104</ref> By that stage, Vianu recalls, Macedonski also had problems coming to terms with his age.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.472-473</ref> His last anthumous work was the pamphlet ''Zaherlina'' (named after the Romanian version of \"[[Zacherlin]]\"; also known as ''Zacherlina'' or ''Zacherlina \u00een continuare'', \"Zacherlin Contd.\"), completed in 1919 and published the following year.<ref>Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.384</ref> It notably attacked Densusianu, who had become Macedonski's personal enemy.<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.13\"/> Some other polemical texts he had authored late in life saw print only after his death, under the title ''Mustr\u0103ri postume c\u0103tre o genera\u021bie ne\u00een\u021beleg\u0103toare'' (\"Posthumous Reprimands for an Obtuse Generation\").<ref name=\"vztcron\" />\n\n1920 was also the year when the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] cabinet attempted to pension him off from his office at the Historical Monuments Commission, but the publicized protest of Macedonski's fellow writers in Bucharest made it reconsider.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.384\"/> Confined to his home by illness and old age, Macedonski was still writing poems, some of which later known as his ''Ultima verba'' (\"Last Words\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.384-385</ref> The writer died on November 24, at three o'clock in the afternoon.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.385</ref> Having come to develop an addiction to floral fragrances, he was inhaling a rose petal extract during his last hours.<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523. According to C\u0103linescu, the poet's last word was ''rozele'' (\"the roses\").</ref> He was buried in Bucharest's [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu]].<ref name=\"vztcron\" />\n\n==Work==\n\n===General characteristics===\n[[File:Macedonski Noaptea de maiu.png|thumb|250px|Macedonski's manuscript for ''Noaptea de mai'' (in or around 1887)]]\n\nAlthough Alexandru Macedonski frequently changed his style and views on literary matters, a number of constants have been traced throughout his work. Thus, a common perception is that his literature had a strongly visual aspect, the notion being condensed in [[Cincinat Pavelescu]]'s definition of Macedonski: \"Poet, therefore painter; painter, therefore poet.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.409\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.409</ref> [[Traian Demetrescu]] too recalled that his mentor had been dreaming of becoming a visual artist, and had eventually settled for turning his son Alexis into one.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.409\"/> This pictorial approach to writing created parallels between Macedonski and his traditionalist contemporaries [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.318, 569; Vianu, Vol.III, p.40, 451</ref>\n\nFollowing the tenets of [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] and [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], the writer repeatedly called for purity in [[Meter (poetry)|versification]], and upheld it as an essential requirement,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.242, 516, 523-524, 683</ref> while progressively seeking to verify the quality of his poetry through [[phonaesthetics]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.28-29</ref> A characteristic of Macedonski's style is his inventive use of [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Initially influenced by [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]]'s introduction of Italian-based words to the [[Romanian lexis]], Macedonski himself later infused poetic language with a large array of neologisms from several [[Romance languages|Romance]] sources.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.415-416, 459-460</ref> Likewise, Vianu notes, Macedonski had a tendency for comparing nature with the artificial, the result of this being a \"document\" of his values.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.450-451</ref> Macedonski's language alternated neologisms with [[Barbarism (modern linguistics)|barbarisms]], many of which were coined by him personally.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Sandqvist, p.200; Vianu, Vol.II, p.451</ref> They include ''claviculat'' (\"[[clavicle]]d\", applied to a shoulder), ''\u00eemp\u0103l\u0103riat\u0103'' (\"enhatted\", used to define a crowd of hat-wearing tourists),<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.451</ref> and ''ureichii'' (instead of ''urechii'', \"to the ear\" or \"of the ear\").<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.525\">C\u0103linescu, p.525</ref> His narratives nevertheless take an interest in recording direct speech, used as a method of characterization.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.449-450, 456</ref> However, C\u0103linescu criticizes Macedonski for using a language which, \"although grammatically correct [...], seems to have been learned only recently\", as well as for not following other Romanian writers in creating a lasting poetic style.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.525\"/>\n\nThe writer's belief in the effects of sheer willpower, notably present in his comments on [[Esotericism|esoteric]] subjects, was itself a defining characteristic of his perspective on literature. In 1882, he wrote about progression in one's career: \"We are all poets at birth, but only those who shape themselves through study will become poets.\"<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.524; Vianu, Vol.II, p.386</ref> Vianu, who notes Macedonski's \"exclusivity\" and \"fanaticism\", places such statements in connection with Macedonski's personal ambition, \"pride\" and \"the willingness to carry out ventured actions [...], in stated opposition with the entire surrounding and with contempt for the foreseeable reaction.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.387-388</ref>\n\nAlmost all periods of Macedonski's work reflect, in whole or in part, his public persona and the polemics he was involved in. George C\u0103linescu's emits a verdict on the relation between his lifetime notoriety and the public's actual awareness of his work: \"Macedonski [was] a poet well-known for being an unknown poet.\"<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.521\"/> According to literary critic [[Matei C\u0103linescu]], the innovative aspects of his impact on [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] were not as much related to his \"literary ideology\", as much as to his \"contradictory spirit\" and \"essential nonconformism\".<ref name=\"Cernat, p.11\"/> However, literary researcher [[Adrian Marino]] proposes that Macedonski was one of the first modern authors to illustrate the importance of \"[[dialectic]] unity\" through his views on art, in particular by having argued that poetry needed to be driven by \"an idea\".<ref>Anghelescu, p.28</ref> Having theorized once, while questioning ''Junimist'' rigor, that \"the logic of poetry is ''absurdity'' itself [italics in the original]\",<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.516. Paraphrased by Sandqvist, p.197, 199.</ref> the poet also said: \"Poetry is the chaos of spirit and matter, of the cries of distress and mad laughter.

The poet probably acknowledged that posterity would reject them, and did not republish them in any of his collected poetry volumes.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.398\"/>\n\nDuring his time at ''Oltul'' (1873\u20131875), Macedonski published a series of poems, most of which were not featured in definitive editions of his work.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.345-346</ref> In addition to [[ode]]s written in the Italian-based version of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], it includes lyrics which satirize [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] without mentioning his name.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.346\"/> Following his arrest, Macedonski also completed ''Celula mea de la V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti'' (\"My Cell in V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti\"), which shows his attempt to joke about the situation.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.347\"/> In contrast to this series, some of the pieces written during Macedonski's time in the [[Budjak]] and [[Northern Dobruja]] display a detachment from contemporary themes. At that stage, he was especially inspired by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], whom Vianu calls \"the sovereign poet of [Macedonski's] youth.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.349\"/> In ''Calul arabului'', Macedonski explores [[Exoticism|exotic]] and [[Levant]]ine settings, using symbols which announce [[George Co\u0219buc]]'s ''[[El-Zorab]]'',<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.348\" /><ref name=\"elrseisl\" /> and the [[Venice|Venetian]]-themed ''Ithalo'', which centers on episodes of betrayal and murder.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.349\"/> Others were epic and [[patriotism|patriotic]] in tone, with subjects such as Romanian victories in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] or the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] sites along the [[Danube]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.348, 349, 395-398</ref> One of these pieces, titled ''Hinov'' after the village and stone quarry in [[Rasova]], gives Macedonski a claim to being the first modern European poet to have used [[free verse]], ahead of the French Symbolist [[Gustave Kahn]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol.II, p.349</ref> Macedonski himself later voiced the claim, and referred to such a technique as \"symphonic verse\", \"proteic verse\", or, in honor of composer [[Richard Wagner]], \"Wagnerian verse\".<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.7, 152; Sandqvist, p.199</ref>\n\nWhile editing ''Oltul'', Macedonski also completed his first prose writings. These were the [[Travel writing|travel account]] ''Pompeia \u0219i Sorento'' (\"Pompeia and Sorento\", 1874) and a prison-themed story described by Vianu as \"a tearjerker\", titled ''C\u00e2inele din V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti'' (\"The Dog in V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti\", 1875).<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.419</ref> These were later complemented by other travel works, which critic [[Mihai Zamfir]] likens to the verbal experiments of [[Impressionist literature]], pioneering in the Romanian [[prose poetry]] genre.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> The short comedy ''Gemenii'' was his debut work for the stage, but, according to Vianu, failed to show any merit other than a \"logical construction\" and a preview into Macedonski's use of sarcasm.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452\"/> These writings were followed in 1876 by a concise biography of [[C\u00e2rjaliul]], an early 19th-century [[hajduk]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.419-420</ref> In line with his first Levant-themed poems, Macedonski authored the 1877 story ''A\u0219a se fac banii'' (\"This Is How Money Is Made\", later retold in French as ''Comment on devient riche et puissant'', \"How to Become Rich and Powerful\"), a [[fable]] of [[fatalism]] and the [[Muslim world]]\u2014it dealt with two brothers, one hard-working and one indolent, the latter of whom earns his money through a series of serendipitous events.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.420, 434</ref> Likewise, his [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse comedy]] ''Iade\u0219!'' borrowed its theme from the widely circulated collection of [[Persian literature]] known as ''Sindipa''.<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453</ref> The setting was however modern, and, as noted by French-born critic [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9]], the plot also borrowed much from [[\u00c9mile Augier]]'s ''Gabrielle'' and from other [[morality play]]s of the period.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453\" /> Part of the text was an ironic treatment of youth in [[liberal profession]]s, an attitude which Macedonski fitted in his emerging anti-[[bourgeois]] discourse.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.454-455</ref>\n\nWith the first poems in his ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle, Macedonski still showed his allegiance to Romanticism, and in particular to [[Alphonse de Lamartine]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.398\"/> and the supposed inventor of this theme, [[Alfred de Musset]].<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.16-18, 24-25; C\u0103linescu, p.524; Suciu, p.105-106</ref> ''Noaptea de noiembrie'' opens with a violent condemnation of his adversaries, and sees Macedonski depicting his own funeral.<ref>Anghelescu, p.22-23</ref> The poem is commended by C\u0103linescu, who notes that, in contrast to the \"apparently trivial beginning\", the main part, where Macedonski depicts himself in flight over the [[Danube]], brings the Romanian writer close to the accomplishments of [[Dante Aligheri]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\">C\u0103linescu, p.528</ref> The writer himself claimed that the piece evidenced \"the uttermost breath of inspiration I have ever felt in my life.\"<ref>Anghelescu, p.14</ref> Another poem, ''Noaptea de aprilie'' (\"April Night\"), was probably his testimony of [[unrequited love]] for [[Aristizza Romanescu]].<ref>Nastas\u0103, p.94</ref>\n\n===Realism and Naturalism===\nBy the 1880s, Macedonski developed and applied his \"social poetry\" theory, as branch of [[Literary realism|Realism]]. Explained by the writer himself as a reaction against the legacy of Lamartine,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.398-399</ref> it also signified his brief affiliation with the [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] current, a radical segment of the Realist movement. [[Traian Demetrescu]] thus noted that Macedonski cherished the works of French Naturalists and Realists such as [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[\u00c9mile Zola]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.389, 421. See also Suciu, p.106</ref> During this phase, Macedonski made known his sympathy for the disinherited, from girls forced into prostitution to convicts sentenced to [[penal labor]] on salt mines, and also spoke out against the conventionalism of [[civil marriage]]s.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.524; Vianu, Vol.II, p.398-402</ref> His ''Ocnele'' (\"The Salt Mines\") includes the verdict:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Vai!

Among them was the first of several [[Sketch story|sketch stories]] using [[still life]] techniques, ''Casa cu nr. 10''<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.420-421, 425-426</ref> (according to Zamfir, a prime sample of Macedonski's \"ornamental\" genre).<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> With ''\u00centre cote\u021be'', ''Dram\u0103 banal\u0103'' and later ''Cometa lui Odorescu'' (\"Odorescu's Comet\"), Macedonski speaks about his own biography.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.426-427</ref> The former has for a protagonist Pandele Vergea, a thirty-five-year-old man who is consumed by an [[Aviculture|avicultural]] obsession, who dreams of turning into a bird, and who is eventually maimed by his overcrowded fowls.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.427-429</ref> In contrast, Dereanu is a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] university student, possessed by dreams of military and political glory, and who meditates about his future in front of Heliade R\u0103dulescu's statue or in Bucharest caf\u00e9s.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.429-430</ref> Also a bohemian, Odorescu announces his discovery of a comet, before being proved wrong by his aunt, an ordinary woman.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.430</ref> Some pieces also double as [[memoir]]s: in ''Dram\u0103 banal\u0103'', the plot revolves around Macedonski's recollection of the 1866 plebiscite.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.423\" /> Vianu draws attention to the [[picturesque]] depiction of [[History of Bucharest|historic Bucharest]], a contributing element in ''Cometa...'', ''Casa cu nr. 10'' and ''\u00centre cote\u021be''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.425-426, 430, 432-433</ref>\n\nWith ''Unchia\u0219ul S\u0103r\u0103cie'' (also written in verse), Macedonski took Naturalist tenets into the field of drama. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9 believed it an imitation of a play by [[Ernest d'Hervilly]] and [[Alfred Gr\u00e9vin]], but, Vianu argues, the Romanian text was only loosely based on theirs: in Macedonski's adaptation, the theme became [[fairy tale]]-like, and used a speech style based on [[Romanian folklore]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.455-456</ref> Around the time of its completion, Macedonski was also working on a similarly loose adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', which notably had the two protagonists die in each other's arms.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.457-458</ref> Another such play is ''3 decemvrie'' (\"December 3\"), which partly retells [[Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner]]'s ''Der 24 Februar'' using Naturalist devices.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.459-462</ref> By contrast, the homage-play ''Cuza-Vod\u0103'' is mainly a Romantic piece, where [[Alexander John Cuza]] finds his political mission validated by legendary figures in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.462\"/>\n\nIn parallel, Macedonski was using poetry to carry out his polemics. In an 1884 [[epigram]], he reacted against Alecsandri's ''[[F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Blanduziei]]'', but, in Vianu's definition, \"his regular causticity seems to be restrained.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.353\"/> The piece he had earlier written, presumably against Eminescu, scandalized the public by mocking the rival's mental ruin:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Un X... pretins poet\u2014acum\nS-a dus pe cel mai jalnic drum...\nL-a\u0219 pl\u00e2nge dac\u0103-n balamuc\nDestinul s\u0103u n-ar fi mai bun\nC\u0103ci p\u00e2n\u0103 ieri a fost n\u0103uc\n\u0218i nu e azi dec\u00e2t nebun.}}<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.354.

Vianu contends that, although Macedonski \"never was familiar with the resigned and patient attitudes\", he was \"by no means an evil man.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.358</ref> On one occasion, the poet defended himself against criticism, noting that the epigram had not been specifically addressed to Eminescu, but had been labeled as such by the press, and claiming to have authored it years before its ''Literatorul'' edition.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.359-360. According to Vianu, Macedonski also stated that poet [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleorm\u0103neanu]] had published the piece without his knowledge, because he liked it and had learned it by heart. Novelist [[I. Peltz]] later claimed that Teleorm\u0103neanu was the poem's real author: {{in lang|ro}} [[Al. S\u0103ndulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/i._peltz_memorialist \"I. Peltz memorialist\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 35/2004.</ref> However, the later piece ''Via\u021ba de apoi'' (\"The Afterlife\") still displays resentments he harbored toward Eminescu.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.357</ref>\n\nBy 1880\u20131884, particularly after the Eminescu scandal, Macedonski envisaged prioritizing French as his language of expression.<ref>Anghelescu, p.11; Vianu, Vol.II, p.361, 362</ref> According to Vianu, Macedonski had traversed \"the lowest point\" of his existence, and had been subject to \"one of the most delicate mysteries of poetic creation.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.363\" /> Among his pieces of the period is the French-language [[sonnet]] ''P\u00e2rle, il me dit alors'' (\"Speak, He Then Said to Me\"), where, Vianu notes, \"one discovers the state of mind of a poet who decides to expatriate himself.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.361\"/>\n\n===Adoption of Symbolism===\n[[File:Fleurs-du-mal ame du vin schlussvignette.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Carlos Schwabe]]'s ''\u00c2me du vin'' (\"Soul of the Wine\"), illustration for [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'']]\n\nAccording to Mihai Zamfir, at the end of his transition from the \"mimetic and egocentric\" verse to Symbolist poetry, Macedonski emerged a \"remarkable, often extraordinary\" author.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> In the early 20th century, fellow poet and critic [[N. Davidescu]] described Macedonski, [[Ion Minulescu]] and other Symbolists from [[Wallachia]] as distinct from their [[Moldavia]]n counterparts in both style and themes.<ref>Cernat, p.17. Cernat notes that the same view is held by Vianu.</ref> Endorsing the theory and practice of Symbolism for much of his life, Macedonski retrospectively claimed to have been one of its first exponents.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Cernat, p.12</ref> His version of Symbolism, critic [[Paul Cernat]] notes, clashed with that advocated by many of his contemporaries in that it rejected merit to the [[Decadent movement]], and represented the \"decorative\" [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] trend of [[Parnassianism|Paranassian]] spirit within the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist current]].<ref>Cernat, p.11-12, 16</ref>\n\nWithin ''Poezia viitorului'', Macedonski invoked as his models to follow some important or secondary Symbolist and Parnassian figures: [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Jean Mor\u00e9as]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.366</ref> In his review of ''Bronzes'' for ''[[Mercure de France]]'', [[Pierre Quillard]] remarked the \"irreproachable\" technique, but criticized the poet for being too indebted to both Baudelaire and [[Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle|Leconte de Lisle]];<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.371\"/> other Symbolist figures whom Macedonski is known to have borrowed from are [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Heredia]]<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.526\">C\u0103linescu, p.526</ref> and [[Iwan Gilkin]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.413</ref> While undergoing this transition, to what linguist Manuela-Delia Suciu argues is a mostly Parnassian phase,<ref>Suciu, p.107-109</ref> Macedonski was still referencing Naturalism, and considered it compatible with Symbolism.<ref>Krasztev, \"From Modernization...\", p.345</ref>\n\nWith the adoption of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where the focus is on minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up until that moment.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.410\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.410</ref> In his ''Osp\u0103\u021bul lui Pentaur'' (\"The Feast of [[Pentaur]]\"), the poet reflected on civilization itself, as reflected in inanimate opulence.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.410\"/> The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in ''Cartea de aur'', collectively titled ''nuvele f\u0103r\u0103 oameni'' (\"novellas without people\") and compared by C\u0103linescu with the paintings of [[Theodor Aman]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.318, 528</ref>\n\nAlso during that stage, Macedonski was exploring the numerous links between Symbolism, [[mysticism]] and [[esotericism]]. Earlier pieces had already come to explore [[macabre]] themes characteristic for an early branch of Symbolism. Influenced by [[Maurice Rollinat]], they include the somber ''Vaporul mor\u021bii'' (\"The Ship of Death\") and ''Visul fatal'' (\"The Fatal Dream\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.363-364, 412</ref> Likewise, the piece titled ''Imnul lui Satan'' (\"Satan's Hymn\") was placed by critics in connection with ''[[Les Litanies de Satan]]'' (part of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''), but, Vianu argues, the source of Macedonski's satanic themes may have been lodged in his own vision of the world.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.407-408</ref> This interest also reflected in his 1893 ''Saul'', where [[Cincinat Pavelescu]]'s contribution is supposedly minimal.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.463</ref> Echoing satanic themes, [[Ernest Legouv\u00e9]]'s dramatic version of the ''[[Medea]]'' myth (which Macedonski translated at some point in his life)<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.463-464</ref> and the classical work of [[Jean Racine]],<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> it shows the dark powers of political conflict intervening between the eponymous king and his ''[[ephebos]]''-like prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[David]], the latter of whom turns out to be the agent of spiritual revolution.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.464-467</ref>\n\n''{{lang|ro|Noaptea de august}}'' (\"August Night\"), outlines a [[Monism|monistic]] belief probably inspired by [[Rosicrucianism]], stressing the unity between soul and matter and depicting Macedonski's own journey into a transcendental space.<ref>Krasztev, \"From a Deadlocked Present...\", p.43</ref> Following the examples of Baudelaire's ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', but also echoing his readings from [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], Macedonski left poems dealing with [[narcotic]]s and [[substance abuse]], at least some of which reflected his personal experience with [[nicotine]] and possibly other unnamed drugs.<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /> Also at that stage, Macedonski also began publishing the \"instrumentalist\" series of his Symbolist poems. This form of [[Experimental literature|experimental poem]] was influenced by the theories of [[Ren\u00e9 Ghil]]<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol.II, p.366, 413-415</ref> and verified through his encounter with [[Remy de Gourmont]]'s views.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.413-415</ref> In parallel, it reaffirmed Macedonski's personal view that music and the spoken word were intimately related (a perspective notably attested by his 1906 interview with [[Jules Combarieu]]).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.341-342\"/> Romanian critic [[Petre R\u0103ileanu]] theorized that such elements evidenced Macedonski's transition to \"[[metaliterature]]\".<ref name=\"Sandqvist, p.200\"/> On a different level, they echoed an older influence, that of [[Gottfried August B\u00fcrger]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.526\" />\n\n===''Excelsior''===\nDespite having stated his interest in innovation, Macedonski generally displayed a more conventional style in his ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'' volume. It included ''Noaptea de mai'', which Vianu sees as \"one of the [vernacular's] most beautiful poems\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.363\" /> and as evidence of \"a clear joy, without any torment whatsoever\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.408</ref> A celebration of spring partly evoking folkloric themes, it was made famous by the recurring [[refrain]], ''Veni\u021bi: privighetoarea c\u00e2nt\u0103 \u0219i liliacul e-nflorit'' (\"Come along: the nightingale is singing and the lilac is in blossom\").<ref>Anghelescu, p.20-21</ref> Like ''Noaptea de mai'', ''Lewki'' (named after and dedicated to the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]]), depicts intense joy, completed in this case by what Vianu calls \"the restorative touch of nature.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.409\"/> The series also returned to [[Levant]] settings and [[Islam]]ic imagery, particularly in ''Ac\u0219am dovalar'' (named after the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] version of ''[[Witr]]'').<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /> Also noted within the volume is his short \"Modern [[Psalms]]\" series, including the piece ''Iertare'' (\"Forgiveness\"), which is addressed to God:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Iertare!

Ornea]] argues, was one of the meeting points between Macedonski and ''Junimism''.<ref>Ornea, p.263</ref> In what is seen as its most acid section, the text notably reads:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|M-am n\u0103scut \u00een ni\u0219te zile c\u00e2nd t\u00e2mpita burghezime\nDin tejghea f\u0103c\u00e2nd tribun\u0103, legiune de co\u021bcari,\nPune-o talp\u0103 noroioas\u0103 pe popor \u0219i boierime,\nZile c\u00e2nd se-mparte \u021bara \u00een c\u0103l\u0103i \u0219i \u00een victime\n\u0218i c\u00e2nd steagul libert\u0103\u021bii e purtat de c\u00e2rciumari.}}<ref>Anghelescu, p.21; Vianu, Vol.II, p.368</ref>\n|\nI was born into days when the moronic bourgeoisie\nTurning counters into rostrums, a legion of knaves,\nPlaces a muddy sole on the people and the boyars,\nDays when the country is divided into hangmen and victims\nAnd when the flag of liberty is carried by publicans.}}\n\nAt the same time as being engaged in his most violent polemics, Macedonski produced meditative and serene poems, which were later judged to be among his best. ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' is the synthesis of his main themes and influences, rated by commentators as his \"masterpiece\".<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.527; Vianu, Vol.II, p.410</ref> Partly based on an earlier poem (''Meka'', named after the [[Mecca|Arab city]]),<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref>Anghelescu, p.25</ref> it tells the story of an [[emir]], who, left unsatisfied by the shallow and opulent life he leads in [[Baghdad]], decides to leave on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]]. While critics agree that it is to be read as an [[allegory]] of Macedonski's biography, the ironic text does not make it clear whether the emir actually reaches his target, nor if the central [[metaphor]] of Mecca as a [[mirage]] means that the goal is not worth sacrificing for.<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref>Anghelescu, p.25-26, 30-31; Perpessicius, p.63; Sandqvist, p.201</ref> While [[Mircea Anghelescu]] comments that Macedonski illustrates \"unusual tension\" by rigorously amplifying references to the color red, seen as a symbol of suffering,<ref>Anghelescu, p.26</ref> C\u0103linescu notes that the sequence of lyrics has a studied \"delirious\" element, and illustrates this with the quote:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|\u0218i el e emirul, \u0219i toate le are...\nE t\u00e2n\u0103r, e farmec, e tr\u0103snet, e zeu,\nDar zilnic se simte furat de-o visare...\nSpre Meka se duce cu g\u00e2ndul mereu,\n\u0218i-n fa\u021ba dorin\u021bei\u2014ce este\u2014dispare\nIar el e emirul, \u0219i toate le are.}}<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.527\"/>\n|\nAnd he is the emir, and he owns each thing...\nHe's young, he's a charm, he's a bolt, he's a god,\nBut in each day he feels he is swept by a dream...\nTowards Mecca his thought races constantly,\nAnd faced with the wish, all things disappear,\nAnd he is the emir, and he owns each thing.}}\n\n===Late prose works===\nIn prose, his focus shifted back to the purely descriptive, or led Alexandru Macedonski into the realm of [[fantasy literature]]. These stories, most of which were eventually collected in ''Cartea de aur'', include memoirs of his childhood in the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia]] region, nostalgic portrayals of the [[Oltenia]]n [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] environment, idealized depictions of Cuza's reign, as well as a retrospective view on the [[Slavery in Romania|end of Rom slavery]] (found in his piece ''Verig\u0103 \u021biganul'', \"Verig\u0103 the Gypsy\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.422-424, 431-432</ref> The best known among them is ''Pe drum de po\u0219t\u0103'', a [[third-person narrative]] and thinly disguised memoir, where the characters are an adolescent Alexandru Macedonski and his father, [[Alexandru D. Macedonski|General Macedonski]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.334, 424-425, 427</ref> The idyllic outlook present in such stories is one of the common meeting points between his version of Symbolism and traditionalist authors such as [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]].<ref>Cernat, p.19; Vianu, Vol.II, p.431, 432</ref> Vianu indicates the connection, but adds: \"Macedonski descended, through memory, in the world of the village, with the tremor of regret for the peace and plenty of the old settlements, so well polished that each person, landowner as well as peasant, lived within a framework that nature itself seemed to have granted. [...] in depicting rural environments, Macedonski presents the point of view of a [[Conservatism|conservative]].\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.432</ref>\n\n''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]'', a fantasy novel and extended [[Prose poetry|prose poem]], was celebrated by Macedonski's disciple [[Oreste Georgescu]] as \"the new religion of humanity\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.377</ref> The volume carried the mocking dedication \"To France, this [[Chaldea]]\" (thought by Vianu to reference P\u00e9ladan's views on the decay of civilization).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.436\"/> It has affinities with writings by the Italian [[Decadent movement|Decadent]] author [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]],<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.528; Cernat, p.89; Vianu, Vol.II, p.436-437, 444</ref> as well as echoes from [[Anatole France]].<ref name=\"mds106\">Suciu, p.106</ref> The hero Thalassa, a Greek boy, works as a [[lighthouse]]-keeper on Snake Island, fantasizing about the [[golden age]] of mankind.<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/><ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.440-441</ref> His fate is changed by a shipwreck, during which a girl, Caliope, reaches the island's shore. Thalassa and Caliope fall in love, but are mysteriously unable to seal their union through sexual intercourse: the boy attributes this failure to the \"curse\" of human individuality. Seeking to achieve a perfect union with his lover, he eventually kills her and drowns himself in the [[Black Sea]].<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/><ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.441-442; Suciu, p.106-107</ref>\n\nIn her review for ''[[Mercure de France]]'', novelist [[Rachilde]] argued: \"Very difficult to read, entirely developed in Symbolist manner [and] almost impossible to recount, obviously written in French but nevertheless obviously conceived by a Romanian (and what a spirited Romanian!).\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.438-439\"/> Rachilde believed the work to display \"the fragrance of Oriental spices [...] rose marmalade and a slice of bear meat.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.439</ref> According to Vianu, the book builds on Macedonski's earlier themes, replacing Naturalist observation with a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation about [[idealism]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.442-444</ref> One other aspect of Macedonski's stylistic exploration took him to attempt recording [[synesthesia]]. His manuscript is written in ink of several colors, which, he believed, was to help readers get a full sense of its meaning.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol. II, p.445</ref> Like other synesthetic aspects of his novel, this is believed to have been inspired by the techniques of Baudelaire<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199; Vianu, Vol. II, p.445</ref> and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199</ref>\n\n''Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu'' is noted for its numerous cultural references, and especially for using a wide range of metaphors. Such aspects have been reviewed negatively by modern critics. Tudor Vianu writes: \"the poet makes such waste of gemstones that we feel like saying some of them must be false\",<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.444</ref> while C\u0103linescu, who notes that some fragments reveal \"an incomparable artist\" and \"a professional metaphorist\", notes that \"in the end, such virtuosities become a bore.\"<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\" /> According to Manuela-Delia Suciu, ''Thalassa'' is \"prolix\" and \"too polished\",<ref name=\"mds106\"/> traits believed by Zamfir to be less irritating in the Romanian version.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> Critic Cornel Moraru found that, in the background, ''Thalassa'', a \"great Symbolist novel\", confronts [[Greek mythology|Ancient Greek]] and [[Christian mythology]], but \"abuses\" the religious vocabulary.<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/> Another part of the novel's imagery is [[Erotic literature|erotic]], and includes an elaborate and aestheticized description of male genitalia.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/index.php?section=rubrici&article_id=35631 \"Sex \u00een scris, sex de scris!\"], in ''[[Jurnalul Na\u021bional]]'', October 9, 2005</ref>\n\nThe four-act [[tragicomedy]] ''Le Fou?'' is seen by Vianu as comparable in subject matter and depth to ''[[Enrico IV]]'', a celebrated 1922 play by [[Luigi Pirandello]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.378, 470-471</ref> The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance of the fact that people saw in him an eccentric.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.378, 467-468, 470, 472</ref> The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to the point where he sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with [[dissociative identity disorder]], Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.469-470</ref> Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.471</ref> The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.529\" /> At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of [[capitalism]], and, using Parisian [[argot]], makes allusive references to famous people of the day.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.471-472</ref>\n\nParticularly during the 1890s, Macedonski was a follower of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and of [[Gothic fiction]] in general, producing a Romanian version of Poe's ''[[Metzengerstein]]'' story, urging his own disciples to translate other such pieces, and adopting \"Gothic\" themes in his original prose.<ref>Thomas C. Carlson, \"Poe in Romania\", in Lois Vines (ed.), ''Poe Abroad. Influence, Reputation, Affinities'', [[University of Iowa Press]], Iowa City, 1999, p.77.  {{ISBN|0-87745-697-6}}</ref> Indebted to [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]], Macedonski also wrote a number of [[science fiction]] stories, including the 1913 ''Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought'', which depicts civilization on the verge of a crisis.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.421-421, 435-436</ref> The gigantic commercial ship is maintained by a banker's union, and designed to grant travelers access to every pleasure imaginable; this causes the working-class inhabited cities on the continent to fall into a state of neglect and permanent violence, the climax of the story occurring with the bankers' decision to destroy their creation.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, 435-436</ref> ''Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought'' is noted for anticipating [[television]], the ship being equipped with electrically-operated \"large and clear mirrors\" that display \"images from various parts of the Earth\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, 435</ref> Macedonski was by then interested in the development of cinema, and authored a [[silent film]] screenplay based on ''Comment on devient riche et puissant''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.448</ref>\n\n===Final transition=== \n[[File:Frederic Leighton - Dante in Exile.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dante in Exile'', 1864 painting by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]]]]\nLate in his life, Macedonski had come to reject Symbolist tenets, defining them as \"imbecilities\" designed for \"the uncultured\".<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.526\" /> ''Ultima verba'', the very last poems to be written by him, show him coming to terms with himself, and are treasured for their serene or intensely joyous vision of life and human accomplishment.<ref>Anghelescu, p.29-31; C\u0103linescu, p.527; Vianu, Vol.II, p.385</ref> The [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]] written at this stage, known collectively as ''[[Poema rondelurilor]]'', are one of the first instances where the technique is used locally. Like those written previously by ''Literatorul''{{'}}s Pavelescu and [[Alexandru Obedenaru]], they are based on an earlier motif present in Macedonski's work, that of recurring refrains.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419</ref> Many of the pieces document the poet's final discoveries. One of them is ''Rondelul crinilor'' (\"The Rondel of the Lilies\"), which proclaims fragrances as the source of beatitude: ''\u00cen crini e be\u021bia cea rar\u0103'', \"In lilies one finds that exceptional drunkenness\".<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /><ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.527\"/> According to [[\u0218tefan Cazimir]], ''Rondelul ora\u0219ului mic'' (\"The Rondel of the Small Town\") shows a \"likable wave of irony and self-irony\", and the poet himself coming to terms with \"the existence of a world who ignores him.\"<ref name=\"stcantxvii\" /> Proof of his combativeness was still to be found in ''Rondelul contimporanilor'' (\"The Rondel of the Contemporaries\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.473-474</ref>\n\nThe poet's take on life is also outlined in his final play, ''Moartea lui Dante''. C\u0103linescu writes that, by then, Macedonski was \"obsessed\" with the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\">C\u0103linescu, p.528</ref> Macedonski identifies with his hero, [[Dante Aligheri]], and formulates his own poetic testament while identifying [[World War I]] Romania with the medieval [[Republic of Florence]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.13; C\u0103linescu, p.523, 529; Vianu, Vol.II, p.474-479</ref> Tudor Vianu remarks: \"In Dante's great self-pride, Macedonski found his own.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.476</ref> He sees the play as the best such work to have been produced by Macedonski,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.478-479, 482</ref> whereas C\u0103linescu deems it \"puerile\".<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.529\"/> Zamfir believes ''Moartea...'' to be a significant text in Macedonski's bibliography, \"one of the first samples of Romanian Symbolist theater\", and as such indebted mainly to Maeterlinck.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> Vianu argues that the play may document the Romanian writer's late rejection of France, through the protagonist's statement: \"the French are a gentle people, but their soul is different from mine.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.477</ref>\n\nA number of rondels show Macedonski's late fascination with the [[Far East]], China and Japan. George C\u0103linescu believes that this is to be understood as one item in a large [[antithesis]], the other being Decadent Paris, which one rondel describes as \"hell\".<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\" /> The Orient, viewed as the space of serenity, is believed by Macedonski to be peopled by toy-like women and absent [[opium]]-smokers, and to be kept orderly by a stable [[meritocracy]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\" /> The Chinese-themed poem ''Tsing-Ly-Tsi'', which Cazimir notes for its discreet, \"almost imperceptible\", humor, reads:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Tsing-Ly-Tsi st\u0103-n prispa de-aur,\nCu ochi mici ca de ghierlan,\nSub de-argint frunzos tezaur,\nCasa e de por\u021belan.}}<ref name=\"stcantxvii\" />\n|\nTsing-Ly-Tsi sits on the golden porch,\nWith his eyes as small as those of mice,\nUnder the silvery, leafy, treasure,\nHis house is porcelain-like.}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Macedonski's school and its early impact===\n[[File:Alexandru Macedonski, Alexis & Oreste Georgescu.JPG|thumb|250px|Alexandru Macedonski (seated, to the right) facing [[Oreste Georgescu]].

The first such figure was ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[Titu Maiorescu]], who believed him to be a minor author, referring to him only a couple of times in his books and usually ridiculing him in his articles.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.407, 412; Ornea, p.117; Vianu, Vol.II, p.243, 356</ref> One of these texts, the 1886 essay ''Poe\u021bi \u0219i critici'' (\"Poets and Critics\"), spoke of Macedonski as having \"vitiated\" poetry, a notion he also applied to [[Constantin D. Aricescu]] and [[Aron Densu\u0219ianu]].<ref>Ornea, p.117</ref> Especially radical pronouncements were left by the traditionalist authors [[Ilarie Chendi]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Chendi wrote of Macedonski being \"the caricature of a man\", having \"a feverish mind\" and being motivated by \"the brutal instinct of revenge\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.391. According to C\u0103linescu (p.638): \"Chendi lacks even the faintest intuition of Macedonski's poetry.\"</ref> Iorga, who became better known as a historian, later retracted some of the statements he had made against the poet during the 1890s.<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.15\"/> Among the younger prominent traditionalist writers was the [[Transylvania]]n-born [[Lucian Blaga]], who may have purposefully avoided Macedonski during his first visit to Bucharest in 1920.<ref>Balot\u0103, p.42</ref> Although more sympathetic to the Symbolist author, both Dragomirescu and [[Gheorghe Adamescu]] tended to describe him as exclusively the product of French and Decadent literature,<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.15\" /> while Dragomirescu's disciple [[Ion Trivale]] denied all merit to Macedonski's literature.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.644</ref>\n\nAccording to Tudor Vianu, Macedonski's intellectual friends (among them [[Anghel Demetriescu]], [[George Ionescu-Gion]], [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], [[Grigore Tocilescu]] and [[V. A. Urechia]]) were largely responsible for passing down \"a better and truer image of the abused poet.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.388-389</ref> It was also due to Dragomirescu that ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' was included in a literature textbook for final grade high school students, which some argue is the poet's first-ever presence in the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.380. According to Anghelescu (p.15), this was preceded by an 1891 textbook published by educator E. Manliu, which introduced Macedonski through his ''Calul arabului''.</ref> According to historian Lucian Nastas\u0103, the poet's wife Ana Rallet behaved like an \"excellent secretary\" while Macedonski was still alive, and thereafter helped sort and edit his manuscript while maintaining \"an actual cult\" for her husband.<ref>Nastas\u0103, p.146</ref>\n\nMacedonski's [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] circle was the center of a literary alternative to the prevailing conservatism and Eminescu-like traditionalism of the day, the latter tendency being grouped around ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' magazine for part of Macedonski's lifetime.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Cernat, p.10-11, 15, 18; Ornea, p.136-137; Sandqvist, p.75, 197, 200, 202</ref> While Macedonski himself maintained his links with Romanticism and Classicism, commentators have retrospectively recognized in him the main person who announced Romania's first wave in [[modernist literature]].<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.139-140; Cernat, p.10-11, 15; Krasztev, \"From Modernization...\", p.334, 338, 343; Sandqvist, p.197, 200; Vianu, Vol.II, p.483</ref> Many first-generation disciples were to part with his guidelines early on, either by radicalizing their Symbolism or by stepping out of its confines. [[Traian Demetrescu]] was one of the first to do so, focusing on his commitment to [[socialism]]\u2014Vianu notes that the split took place \"without coldness and the heart's versatility\" on Macedonski's part.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.391</ref> Literary researcher [[Lidia Bote]] argues that it was Petic\u0103 who first illustrated mature Symbolism, emancipating himself from Macedonski's [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] tendencies after 1902.<ref>Cernat, p.15</ref> By that time, the Symbolist authors [[Dimitrie Anghel]] and [[N.

His admirers were writing poetry about him as early as 1874,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.342</ref> and, in 1892, [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] published a rhapsodizing portrait of Macedonski as \"the Artist\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.387</ref> Pavelescu, Dragoslav and Petic\u0103 paid homage to the writer by leaving recollections which describe him as a devoted and considerate friend.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.390</ref> In contrast, traditionalist poet [[Alexandru Vlahu\u021b\u0103]] authored an 1889 [[sketch story]] in which Macedonski (referred to as ''Polidor'') is the object of derision.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.558; Vianu, Vol.II, p.386-387.

A. Macedonski''', '''Macedonschi''' or '''Macedonsky'''; March 14, 1854 \u2013 November 24, 1920) was a [[Romania]]n poet, novelist, dramatist and literary critic, known especially for having promoted French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] in his native country, and for leading the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]] during its early decades. A forerunner of local [[modernist literature]], he is the first local author to have used [[free verse]], and claimed by some to have been the first in modern [[European literature]]. Within the framework of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Macedonski is seen by critics as second only to [[List of national poets|national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]]; as leader of a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] trend formed around his ''[[Literatorul]]'' journal, he was diametrically opposed to the inward-looking traditionalism of Eminescu and his school.\n\nDebuting as a [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantic]] in the [[Wallachia]]n tradition, Macedonski went through the [[Literary realism|Realist]]-[[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] stage deemed \"social poetry\", while progressively adapting his style to Symbolism and [[Parnassianism]], and repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempting to impose himself in the [[Francophone]] world. Despite having theorized \"instrumentalism\", which reacted against the traditional guidelines of poetry, he maintained a lifelong connection with [[Neoclassicism]] and its ideal of purity. Macedonski's quest for excellence found its foremost expression in his recurring motif of life as a [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], notably used in his critically acclaimed ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle. The stylistic stages of his career are reflected in the collections ''[[Prima verba]]'', ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poezii]]'', and ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'', as well as in the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novel]] ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]''. In old age, he became the author of [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]], noted for their detached and serene vision of life, in contrast with his earlier combativeness.\n\nIn parallel to his literary career, Macedonski was a civil servant, notably serving as [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] in the [[Budjak]] and [[Northern Dobruja]] during the late 1870s. As journalist and militant, his allegiance fluctuated between the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] and [[conservatism]], becoming involved in polemics and controversies of the day. Of the long series of publications he founded, ''Literatorul'' was the most influential, notably hosting his early conflicts with the ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society. These targeted [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and especially Eminescu, their context and tone becoming the cause of a major rift between Macedonski and his public. This situation repeated itself in later years, when Macedonski and his ''[[For\u021ba Moral\u0103]]'' magazine began campaigning against the ''Junimist'' dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], whom they falsely accused of [[plagiarism]]. During [[World War I]], the poet aggravated his critics by supporting the [[Central Powers]] against Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]]. His biography was also marked by an enduring interest in [[esotericism]], numerous attempts to become recognized as an inventor, and an enthusiasm for [[cycling]].\n\nThe scion of a political and aristocratic family, the poet was the son of [[Alexandru D. Macedonski|General Alexandru Macedonski]], who served as [[Ministry of Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]], and the grandson of [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|1821 rebel]] [[Dimitrie Macedonski]]. Both his son [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] and grandson [[Soare Macedonski|Soare]] were known painters.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and family===\n[[File:Macedonski Rondelul trecutului.png|thumb|260px|Manuscript version for one of Macedonski's late poems, referencing his family's estates on the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia Valley]]]]\n\nThe poet's paternal family had arrived in [[Wallachia]] during the early 19th century.

C\u0103linescu also renders the family's alternative theory, according to which their ancestors were [[Italo-Russian]] (p.517).</ref> Maria had been adopted by the boyar Dumitrache P\u00e2r\u00e2ianu, and the couple had inherited the Ad\u00e2ncata and Pomete\u0219ti estates in [[Goie\u0219ti]], on the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia Valley]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.517-518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.339-341</ref>\n\nBoth the poet and his father were dissatisfied with accounts of their lineage, contradicting them with an account that researchers have come to consider spurious.<ref>Anghelescu, p.7; C\u0103linescu, p.517; Vianu, Vol.II, p.330-332</ref> Although adherents of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], the Macedonskis traced their origin to [[Rogala coat of arms|Rogala]]-bearing [[Lithuanian nobility]] from the defunct [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.7; C\u0103linescu, p.517, 519, 520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.330, 331-332</ref> While the writer perpetuated his father's claim, it is possible that he also took pride in investigating his [[Balkans|Balkan]] roots: according to literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]], who, as a youth, was a member of his circle, this tendency is attested by two of Macedonski's poems from the 1880s, where the South Slavs appear as icons of freedom.<ref>The pieces are named ''V\u00e2nt de stepe'' (\"[[Steppe]] Wind\") and ''Stepa'' (\"The Steppe\"). Vianu (Vol.II, p.333) places emphasis on \"[Macedonski's] soul [...] where so many of his ancestors' instincts resided.\"</ref> Vianu's contemporary, literary historian [[George C\u0103linescu]], postulated that, although the family had been absorbed into the ethnic and cultural majority, the poet's origin served to enrich [[Culture of Romania|local culture]] by linking it to a \"[[Thracians|Thracian]]\" tradition and the spirit of \"adventurers\".<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.517, 974, 976</ref>\n\nThe family moved often, following General Macedonski's postings. Born in [[Bucharest]], Macedonski-son was the third of four siblings, the oldest of whom was a daughter, Caterina.<ref>An amateur poet, she later married into the [[Ghica family]], but divorced, marrying a second time, to a [[France|Frenchman]] by the name of Leboeuf (Vianu, Vol.II, p.340).</ref> Before the age of six, he was a sickly and nervous child, who is reported to have had regular [[tantrum]]s.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.518; Suciu, p.104; Vianu, Vol.II, p.342</ref> In 1862, his father sent him to school in Oltenia, and he spent most time in the Amaradia region.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.340-341\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.340-341</ref> The nostalgia he felt for the landscape later made him consider writing an ''Am\u0103r\u0103zene'' (\"Amaradians\") cycle, of which only one poem was ever completed.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.340-341\" /> He was attending the [[Carol I National College|Carol I High School]] in [[Craiova]] and, according to his official record, graduated in 1867.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.342</ref>\n\nMacedonski's father had by then become known as an authoritarian commander, and, during his time in [[T\u00e2rgu Ocna]], faced a [[mutiny]] which only his wife could stop by pleading with the soldiers (an episode which made an impression on the future poet).<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.334</ref> A stern parent, he took an active part in educating his children.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.334-335</ref> Having briefly served as [[Ministry of Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]], the general was mysteriously dismissed by Cuza in 1863, and his pension became the topic of a political scandal. It ended only under the rule of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], Cuza's [[Hohenzollern]] successor, when [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] voted against increasing the sum to the level demanded by its recipient.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.337\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.337</ref> Having preserved a negative impression of the [[Romanian plebiscite, 1866|1866 plebiscite]], during which Cuza's dethronement had been confirmed,<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.423\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.423</ref> Macedonski remained a committed opponent of the new ruler. As a youth and adult, he sought to revive his father's cause, and included allusions to the perceived injustice in at least one poem.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.337\" /> After spending the last months of his life protesting against the authorities, Macedonski-father fell ill and died in September 1869, leaving his family to speculate that he had been murdered by political rivals.<ref>Anghelescu, p.8; C\u0103linescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.338, 344</ref>\n\n===Debut years===\n[[File:Alexandru Macedonski - prima pagina - Prima verba.png|thumb|First page of ''[[Prima verba]]'', 1872]]\n\nMacedonski left Romania in 1870, traveling through [[Austria-Hungary]] and spending time in [[Vienna]], before visiting Switzerland and possibly other countries; according to one account, it was here that he may have first met (and disliked) his rival poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], at a time a Viennese student.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/rivalul_lui_eminescu \"Rivalul lui Eminescu\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 27/2009</ref> Macedonski's visit was meant to be preparation for entering the [[University of Bucharest]], but he spent much of his time in the [[Bohemianism|bohemian environment]], seeking entertainment and engaging in romantic escapades.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.342-344</ref> He was however opposed to the lifestyle choices of people his age, claiming that they were engaged in \"orgy after orgy\".<ref name=\"aonarco22\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509083836/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=4538&nr=2008-05-07 \"Scriitorii rom\u00e2ni \u0219i narcoticele (2).

In 1874, back in Craiova, Macedonski founded a short-lived literary society known as ''Junimea'', a title which purposefully or unwittingly copied that of the influential [[Junimea|conservative association]] with whom he would later quarrel.<ref>Anghelescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol.II, p.346</ref> It was then that he met journalist and pedagogue [[\u0218tefan Velescu]], a meeting witnessed by Velescu's pupil, the future liberal journalist [[Constantin Bacalba\u0219a]], who recorded it in his [[memoir]]s.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.345</ref> ''Oltul'' magazine, which he had helped establish and which displayed a liberal agenda, continued to be published until July 1875, and featured Macedonski's translations from [[Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger]], [[Hector de Charlieu]] and [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], as well as his debut in [[travel writing]] and short story.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.345, 419</ref> At age 22, he worked on his first play, a [[comedy]] titled ''Gemenii'' (\"The Twins\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.452</ref> In 1874 that he came to the attention of young journalist future dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], who [[Satire|satirized]] him in articles for the magazine ''[[Ghimpele]]'', ridiculing his claim to Lithuanian descent, and eventually turning him into the character ''Aamsky'', whose fictional career ends with his death from exhaustion caused by contributing to \"for the country's political development\".<ref>Cioculescu, p.52-53</ref> This was the first episode in a consuming polemic between the two figures.

At the time, Russian volunteers were amassed on the Budjak border, requesting from the Romanian authorities the right of free passage into the [[Principality of Serbia]]. The National Liberal Premier [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]], who was negotiating an anti-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] alliance, sent Macedonski signals to let them pass, but the prefect, obeying the official recommendation of [[Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Internal Affairs Minister]] [[George D.

Vianu notes that changes took place in the poet's relationship with his public: \"Society recognizes in him the nonconformist. [...] The man becomes singular; people start talking about his oddities.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.350</ref> Macedonski's presumed frustration at being perceived in this way, Vianu notes, may have led him closer to the idea of ''[[po\u00e8te maudit]]'', theorized earlier by [[Paul Verlaine]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.350, 360-361</ref> In this context, he had set his sight on promoting \"social poetry\", the merger between [[lyricism]] and political militantism.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.515-516, 523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.343, 351</ref> Meanwhile, according to C\u0103linescu, his attacks on the liberals and the \"daft insults he aimed at [Romania's] throne\" had effectively ruined his own chance of political advancement.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.519\" />\n\nIn January 1880, he launched his most influential and long-lived publication, ''[[Literatorul]]'', which was also the focal point of his [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] cultural circle, and, in later years, of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist school]]. In its first version, the magazine was co-edited by Macedonski, Bonifaciu Florescu and poet [[Th. M. Stoenescu]].<ref>Ornea, p.301; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351</ref> Florescu parted with the group soon after, due to a disagreement with Macedonski, and was later attacked by the latter for allegedly accumulating academic posts.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.529\">C\u0103linescu, p.529</ref> ''Literatorul'' aimed to irritate ''Junimist'' sensibilities from its first issue, when it stated its dislike for \"political prejudice in literature.\"<ref>Ornea, p.301</ref> This was most likely an allusion to the views of ''Junimist'' figure [[Titu Maiorescu]], being later accompanied by explicit attacks on him and his followers.<ref>Ornea, p.301-302</ref> An early success for the new journal was the warm reception it received from [[Vasile Alecsandri]], a Romantic poet and occasional ''Junimist'' whom Macedonski idolized at the time, and the collaboration of popular memoirist [[Gheorghe Sion]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.351\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.351</ref> Another such figure was the intellectual [[V. A. Urechia]], whom Macedonski made president of the ''Literatorul'' Society.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.529; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351</ref> In 1881, [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Education Minister]] Urechia granted Macedonski the ''Bene-Merenti'' medal 1st class,<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.519; Sandqvist, p.197</ref> although, C\u0103linescu stresses, the poet had only totaled 18 months of public service.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.519\" /> At around that time, Macedonski had allegedly begun courting actress [[Aristizza Romanescu]], who rejected his advances, leaving him unenthusiastic about love matters and unwilling to seek female company.<ref>Nastas\u0103, p.94, 97-98, 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexandru Macedonski - prima pagina - Poesii.png|thumb|First page of ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poesii]]'', 1882]]\nIn parallel, Macedonski used the magazine to publicize his disagreement with the main ''Junimist'' voice, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''. Among the group of contributors, several had already been victims of Maiorescu's irony: Sion, Urechia, Pantazi Ghica and [[Petru Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu]].<ref>Ornea, p.302-303</ref> While welcoming the debut of its contributor, [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]]-[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] novelist and poet [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.351\"/> Macedonski repeatedly attacked its main exponent, the conservative poet Eminescu, claiming not to understand his poetry.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-355. According to Vianu (Vol.II, p.355), [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] also joined in the attack, using ''Literatorul'' for articles where his rival Eminescu was being criticized on various grounds, and signing them with the pseudonym ''Rienzi''.</ref> However, ''Literatorul'' was also open to contributions from some ''Convorbiri Literare'' affiliates (Zamfirescu, [[Matilda Cugler-Poni]] and [[Veronica Micle]]).<ref>Ornea, p.303</ref>\n\nIn November 1880, Macedonski's plays ''Iade\u0219!'' (\"Wishbone!\", a comedy first printed in 1882) and ''Unchia\u0219ul S\u0103r\u0103cie'' (\"Old Man Poverty\") premiered at the [[National Theater Bucharest]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 452</ref> A sign of government approval, this was followed by Macedonski's appointment to a minor administrative office, as Historical Monuments Inspector.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519; Sandqvist, p.197; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 361</ref> Nevertheless, both plays failed to impose themselves on public perception, and were withdrawn from the program by 1888.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.462\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.462</ref> C\u0103linescu asserts that, although Macedonski later claimed to have always been facing poverty, his job in the administration, coupled with other sources of revenue, ensured him a comfortable existence.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519-520</ref>\n\nIn 1881, Macedonski published a new collection of poetry. Titled ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poezii]]'', it carries the year \"1882\" on its original cover.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 394</ref> Again moving away from liberalism, Macedonski sought to make himself accepted by ''Junimea'' and Maiorescu.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.356-357</ref> He consequently attended the ''Junimea'' sessions, and gave a public reading of ''Noaptea de noiembrie'' (\"November Night\"), the first publicized piece in his lifelong ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; Ornea, p.304-305; Vianu, Vol.I, p.54; Vol.II, p.356</ref> It reportedly earned him the praise of historian and poet [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], who, although an anti-''Junimist'', happened to be in the audience.<ref>Anghelescu, p.16; Vianu, Vol.I, p.54</ref> Despite rumors according to which he had applauded Macedonski, Maiorescu himself was not impressed, and left an unenthusiastic account of the event in his private diary.<ref>Anghelescu, p.16; Perpessicius, p.246; Ornea, p.304</ref>\n\n===Against Alecsandri and Eminescu===\nMacedonski's open conflict with ''Junimea'' began in 1882, when he engaged in a publicized polemic with Alecsandri.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.296; Vianu, Vol.II, p.350-352</ref> It was ignited when, through Macedonski's articles, ''Literatorul'' criticized Alecsandri for accepting [[Romanian Academy]] prizes despite being its member,<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.296; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351-352</ref> and later involved Sion (whose replies on behalf of the Academy were derided by Macedonski).<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.351-352</ref> Macedonski also took distance from Alecsandri's style, publishing a \"critical analysis\" of his poetry in one issue of ''Literatorul''.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10</ref> In turn, Alecsandri humiliated his young rival by portraying him as [[Zoilus]], the prototype of slanderers, and himself as the model poet [[Horace]] in the 1883 play ''[[F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Blanduziei]]''.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.316; Vianu, Vol.II, p.352-353</ref> The two were eventually reconciled, and Macedonski again spoke of Alecsandri as his ideological and stylistic predecessor.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.353\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.353</ref>\n\nIn April 1882, Eminescu had also replied to Macedonski in ''[[Timpul]]'' journal, referring to an unnamed poet who \"barely finishes high-school, comes over to Bucharest selling nick-nacks and makeup [and goes into] literary dealership\". Reproaching Macedonski's attacks on Alecsandri, Eminescu makes a [[nationalism|nationalist]] comment about the young poet bearing \"the bastard instincts of those foreigners who were [[Romanianization|Romanianized]] only yesterday\", and attributes him \"the physiognomy of a hairdresser\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.357. Vianu believes that Macedonski had not authored any of the anti-Eminescu articles before that date.</ref> Through the articles of [[Petru Th. Missir]], ''Convorbiri Literare'' gave ''Poezii'' a negative review, deemed \"malevolent\" by literary historian [[Mircea Anghelescu]].<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.15\">Anghelescu, p.15</ref> At the other end of the political and cultural spectrum, Macedonski faced opposition from the intellectuals attracted to [[socialism]], in particular ''[[Contemporanul]]'' editors [[Constantin Mille]] and [[Ioan N\u0103dejde]], with whom he was engaged in an extended polemic.<ref>Anghelescu, p.15; Perpessicus, p.138-139, 266, 352</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, Macedonski published his own play, which had Cuza for its main character and was eponymously titled ''Cuza-Vod\u0103'',<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.462\"/> and completed translations for ''Literatorul''\u2014from [[Maurice Rollinat]], whom he helped impose as a main cultural reference in Romanian Symbolism, and from the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Akhillefs Paraskhos]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.296-299; Vol.III, p.385-386</ref> In 1883, he also contributed his first [[sketch story]], ''Casa cu nr. 10'' (\"The House at Number 10\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.420-421</ref> In early 1883, he married Ana Rallet-Sl\u0103tineanu.<ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.519; Nastas\u0103, p.106; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353</ref> Wealthy and supposedly related to Romanian aristocrats,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519; Nastas\u0103, p.106-107</ref> she would bear him five children in all: the painter [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] was the eldest, followed by Nikita; the three youngest were two sons (Panel and Constantin Macedonski) and a daughter, Anna (also known as Nina).<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.522</ref> His heterosexual lifestyle notwithstanding, Macedonski remained a self-avowed admirer of male beauties, and was rumored to be a closeted homosexual.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/>\n\nIn July 1883, Macedonski undertook one of his most controversial anti-''Junimist'' actions. That month, ''Literatorul'' published an [[epigram]] signed with the pseudonym ''Duna'',<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.353\"/> deriding an unnamed author who had lost his mind. Mihai Eminescu\u2014whom many had already come to see as Romania's [[List of national poets|national poet]]\u2014had by then developed a [[mental disorder]] which had become known to the general public. Ever since that moment, Macedonski has generally been believed to be ''Duna'', and as a result, was faced with much criticism from both readers and commentators.<ref name=\"vztcron\"/><ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.10; C\u0103linescu, p.519, 520-521; Cernat, p.10; Perpessicius, p.138-139, 266, 352; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-361, 387</ref> The intense anti-''Literatorul'' press campaign was initiated in August, when writer [[Grigore Ventura]] issued an article condemning Macedonski's attitude (published in the Bucharest-based newspaper ''[[L'Ind\u00e9pendance Roumaine]]''), with Macedonski responding in the National Liberal organ ''[[Rom\u00e2nul]]''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.358-360</ref> During one evening, Macedonski is reported to have been assaulted by anonymous supporters of Eminescu.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.359</ref> His previous conflict with N\u0103dejde was also affected by this renewed controversy: while opposed to ''Junimist'' policies, the socialists at ''Contemporanul'' voiced their admiration for Eminescu's art.<ref>Perpessicus, p.138-139, 266, 352</ref>\n\nLate in 1883, Macedonski and his friends unveiled [[Ion Georgescu]]'s statue of their mentor Bolintineanu in the National Theater lobby. The circumstances in which this took place rose suspicion of foul play; on this grounds, Macedonski was ridiculed by his former friend Zamfirescu in the journal ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103]]'', which left him embittered.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.533; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-354, 391</ref> C\u0103linescu proposes that, although such negative reactions were invoked by Macedonski's supporters as a sign of their mentor having been marginalized, Macedonski had expressed his dissatisfaction with the cultural environment long before that moment, and was still a respected figure even after the incidents took place.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.519-520, 521</ref>\n\n===First Paris sojourn and ''Poezia viitorului''===\n[[File:Le Vaisseau fant\u00f4me Macedonski L'\u00c9lan litt\u00e9raire.PNG|thumb|260px|Macedonski's poem ''Le Vaisseau fant\u00f4me'' (\"The Phantom Ship\"), as originally published in ''[[L'\u00c9lan litt\u00e9raire]]'' (February 1885)]]\n\nHaving been stripped of his administrative office by the new Br\u0103tianu cabinet,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.360-361</ref> Macedonski faced financial difficulties, and was forced to move into a house on the outskirts of Bucharest, and later moved between houses in northern Bucharest.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.520-521, 523</ref> According to C\u0103linescu, the poet continued to cultivate luxury and passionately invested in the [[decorative arts]], although his source of income, other than the supposed assistance \"of [European] ruling houses\", remains a mystery.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.522-523</ref> Arguing that Macedonski was \"always in need of money\" to use on his luxury items, poet [[Victor Eftimiu]] claimed: \"He did not shy away from sending emphatic notes to the potentates of his day [...], flattering some, threatening others.

What followed the Mackensen article, Vianu claims, was Macedonski's ''bellum contra omnes'' (\"war against all\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.384\"/> However, the poet made efforts to accommodate himself with the triumphal return of the Ia\u0219i authorities: in December 1918, ''Literatorul'' celebrated the extension of Romanian rule \"from the [[Tisza]] to the [[Dniester]]\" as a success of the National Liberals, paying homage to Francophile political leaders [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] and [[Take Ionescu]].<ref>Boia, p.248</ref> Macedonski also envisaged running in the [[1918 Romanian general election|1918 election]] for a seat in the new [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] (which was supposed to vote a document to replace the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]] as the organic law), but never registered his candidature.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.384</ref> According to Vianu, he had intended to create a [[joke political party]], the \"intellectual group\", whose other member was an unnamed coffeehouse acquaintance of his.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.392</ref> ''Literatorul'' was revived for a final time in 1919.<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.13\"/>\n\nHis health deteriorated from [[heart disease]], which is described by Vianu as an effect of constant smoking.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.393. See also Suciu, p.104</ref> By that stage, Vianu recalls, Macedonski also had problems coming to terms with his age.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.472-473</ref> His last anthumous work was the pamphlet ''Zaherlina'' (named after the Romanian version of \"[[Zacherlin]]\"; also known as ''Zacherlina'' or ''Zacherlina \u00een continuare'', \"Zacherlin Contd.\"), completed in 1919 and published the following year.<ref>Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.384</ref> It notably attacked Densusianu, who had become Macedonski's personal enemy.<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.13\"/> Some other polemical texts he had authored late in life saw print only after his death, under the title ''Mustr\u0103ri postume c\u0103tre o genera\u021bie ne\u00een\u021beleg\u0103toare'' (\"Posthumous Reprimands for an Obtuse Generation\").<ref name=\"vztcron\" />\n\n1920 was also the year when the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] cabinet attempted to pension him off from his office at the Historical Monuments Commission, but the publicized protest of Macedonski's fellow writers in Bucharest made it reconsider.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.384\"/> Confined to his home by illness and old age, Macedonski was still writing poems, some of which later known as his ''Ultima verba'' (\"Last Words\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.384-385</ref> The writer died on November 24, at three o'clock in the afternoon.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.385</ref> Having come to develop an addiction to floral fragrances, he was inhaling a rose petal extract during his last hours.<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523.

Thus, a common perception is that his literature had a strongly visual aspect, the notion being condensed in [[Cincinat Pavelescu]]'s definition of Macedonski: \"Poet, therefore painter; painter, therefore poet.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.409\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.409</ref> [[Traian Demetrescu]] too recalled that his mentor had been dreaming of becoming a visual artist, and had eventually settled for turning his son Alexis into one.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.409\"/> This pictorial approach to writing created parallels between Macedonski and his traditionalist contemporaries [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.318, 569; Vianu, Vol.III, p.40, 451</ref>\n\nFollowing the tenets of [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] and [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], the writer repeatedly called for purity in [[Meter (poetry)|versification]], and upheld it as an essential requirement,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.242, 516, 523-524, 683</ref> while progressively seeking to verify the quality of his poetry through [[phonaesthetics]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.28-29</ref> A characteristic of Macedonski's style is his inventive use of [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Initially influenced by [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]]'s introduction of Italian-based words to the [[Romanian lexis]], Macedonski himself later infused poetic language with a large array of neologisms from several [[Romance languages|Romance]] sources.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.415-416, 459-460</ref> Likewise, Vianu notes, Macedonski had a tendency for comparing nature with the artificial, the result of this being a \"document\" of his values.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.450-451</ref> Macedonski's language alternated neologisms with [[Barbarism (modern linguistics)|barbarisms]], many of which were coined by him personally.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Sandqvist, p.200; Vianu, Vol.II, p.451</ref> They include ''claviculat'' (\"[[clavicle]]d\", applied to a shoulder), ''\u00eemp\u0103l\u0103riat\u0103'' (\"enhatted\", used to define a crowd of hat-wearing tourists),<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.451</ref> and ''ureichii'' (instead of ''urechii'', \"to the ear\" or \"of the ear\").<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.525\">C\u0103linescu, p.525</ref> His narratives nevertheless take an interest in recording direct speech, used as a method of characterization.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.449-450, 456</ref> However, C\u0103linescu criticizes Macedonski for using a language which, \"although grammatically correct [...], seems to have been learned only recently\", as well as for not following other Romanian writers in creating a lasting poetic style.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.525\"/>\n\nThe writer's belief in the effects of sheer willpower, notably present in his comments on [[Esotericism|esoteric]] subjects, was itself a defining characteristic of his perspective on literature. In 1882, he wrote about progression in one's career: \"We are all poets at birth, but only those who shape themselves through study will become poets.\"<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.524; Vianu, Vol.II, p.386</ref> Vianu, who notes Macedonski's \"exclusivity\" and \"fanaticism\", places such statements in connection with Macedonski's personal ambition, \"pride\" and \"the willingness to carry out ventured actions [...], in stated opposition with the entire surrounding and with contempt for the foreseeable reaction.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.387-388</ref>\n\nAlmost all periods of Macedonski's work reflect, in whole or in part, his public persona and the polemics he was involved in. George C\u0103linescu's emits a verdict on the relation between his lifetime notoriety and the public's actual awareness of his work: \"Macedonski [was] a poet well-known for being an unknown poet.\"<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.521\"/> According to literary critic [[Matei C\u0103linescu]], the innovative aspects of his impact on [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] were not as much related to his \"literary ideology\", as much as to his \"contradictory spirit\" and \"essential nonconformism\".<ref name=\"Cernat, p.11\"/> However, literary researcher [[Adrian Marino]] proposes that Macedonski was one of the first modern authors to illustrate the importance of \"[[dialectic]] unity\" through his views on art, in particular by having argued that poetry needed to be driven by \"an idea\".<ref>Anghelescu, p.28</ref> Having theorized once, while questioning ''Junimist'' rigor, that \"the logic of poetry is ''absurdity'' itself [italics in the original]\",<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.516. Paraphrased by Sandqvist, p.197, 199.</ref> the poet also said: \"Poetry is the chaos of spirit and matter, of the cries of distress and mad laughter. From the sublime to the trivial, that is what it should be.\"<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.152. Paraphrased by Sandqvist, p.25, 199.</ref> He later revised part of this verdict, and, making explicit his adoption of [[aestheticism]], spoke against trivial subjects and in favor of the sublime.<ref name=\"Sandqvist, p.200\">Sandqvist, p.200</ref>\n\nWhile Macedonski also discarded the concept of \"social poetry\" not long after postulating it, its spirit, Tudor Vianu believes, can still be found in his later contributions. This, the critic notes, was owed to his \"social temperament\", whose \"fundamental experience is that of the social.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.402</ref> Discussing this sociable and extrovert character, other critics see in the poet's life and work the imprint of \"[[quixotism]]\".<ref>Anghelescu, p.140; Cernat, p.8, 16; Sandqvist, p.200</ref><ref name=\"arteodo\">Alexandru Ruja, chronological table, in [[P\u0103storel Teodoreanu]], ''T\u0103m\u00e2ie \u0219i otrav\u0103'', [[Editura de Vest]], Timi\u0219oara, 1994, p.14-15.  {{ISBN|973-36-0165-9}}</ref> Also according to Vianu, this contrasted with Macedonski's failures in communicating with the public, an experience which made him \"[[Misanthropy|misanthropic]]\" and contributed to his ultimate vision of death as freedom.<ref>Anghelescu, p.137; Vianu, Vol.II, p.403-406, 434-435</ref> Literary historian [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] concluded: \"Macedonski could not resign; his one martyrdom was for Art, as the sole liberation from a tormented life.\"<ref>Anghelescu, p.138</ref> Other commentators have defined the poet's perspective on life as a result of \"[[neurosis]]\".<ref name=\"Sandqvist, p.200\"/>\n\nIn Vianu's perspective, Macedonski's stance is dominated by a mixture of [[nostalgia]], [[sensuality]], lugubrious-grotesque imagery, and \"the lack of bashfulness for antisocial sentiments\" which compliments his [[sarcasm]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.404-405</ref> In respect to the latter characteristic, Vianu notes \"no one in Romanian literature has laughed the same way as Macedonski\",<ref>Anghelescu, p.137; Vianu, Vol.II, p.405</ref> whereas critic [[\u0218tefan Cazimir]] argues: \"[Macedonski was] lacking the sense of relativity in principles, and implicitly a sense of humor.\" Cazimir adds: \"Only when he aged did [Macedonski] learn to smile\".<ref name=\"stcantxvii\">[[\u0218tefan Cazimir]], preface to ''Antologia umorului liric'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1977, p.XVII.  {{OCLC|251657588}}</ref> George C\u0103linescu himself believes Macedonski to have been \"fundamentally a spiritual man with lots of humor\", speculating that he was able to see the \"uselessness\" of his own scientific ventures.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.523\"/>\n\nCritics note that, while Macedonski progressed from one stage to the other, his work fluctuated between artistic accomplishment and mediocrity.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523-524, 525-526, 527, 528; Vianu, Vol.II, p.393, 394, 480-481</ref> Tudor Vianu believes \"failure in reaching originality\" and reliance on \"soppy-conventional attributes of the day\" to be especially evident wherever Macedonski tried to emulate [[epic poetry]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.394</ref> He also notes that Macedonski's love-themed pieces \"cannot be listed among [his] most fortunate\".<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.398\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.398</ref> At his best, commentators note, he was one of the Romanian literature's classics.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.393-394</ref> Macedonski is thus perceived as the author second only to Eminescu, and as his ideal counterpart\u2014a relation Vianu describes as \"the internal [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] [confronting] two [[Lares|familiar gods]]\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.III, p.353-354</ref> Various critics have compared Eminescu's poetic discourse with that of the Symbolist leader, concluding that the two poets often display very similar attitudes.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.24, 27-28; C\u0103linescu, p.518, 524, 526</ref> C\u0103linescu writes that, while Macedonski's work is largely inferior to that of his ''Junimist'' rival, it forms the best \"reply\" ever conceived within their common setting.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.527\">C\u0103linescu, p.527</ref>\n\n===''Prima verba'' and other early works===\nWith [[Ion Catina]], [[Vasile P\u0103un]] and [[Grigore H.

The poet probably acknowledged that posterity would reject them, and did not republish them in any of his collected poetry volumes.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.398\"/>\n\nDuring his time at ''Oltul'' (1873\u20131875), Macedonski published a series of poems, most of which were not featured in definitive editions of his work.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.345-346</ref> In addition to [[ode]]s written in the Italian-based version of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], it includes lyrics which satirize [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] without mentioning his name.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.346\"/> Following his arrest, Macedonski also completed ''Celula mea de la V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti'' (\"My Cell in V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti\"), which shows his attempt to joke about the situation.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.347\"/> In contrast to this series, some of the pieces written during Macedonski's time in the [[Budjak]] and [[Northern Dobruja]] display a detachment from contemporary themes. At that stage, he was especially inspired by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], whom Vianu calls \"the sovereign poet of [Macedonski's] youth.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.349\"/> In ''Calul arabului'', Macedonski explores [[Exoticism|exotic]] and [[Levant]]ine settings, using symbols which announce [[George Co\u0219buc]]'s ''[[El-Zorab]]'',<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.348\" /><ref name=\"elrseisl\" /> and the [[Venice|Venetian]]-themed ''Ithalo'', which centers on episodes of betrayal and murder.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.349\"/> Others were epic and [[patriotism|patriotic]] in tone, with subjects such as Romanian victories in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] or the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] sites along the [[Danube]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.348, 349, 395-398</ref> One of these pieces, titled ''Hinov'' after the village and stone quarry in [[Rasova]], gives Macedonski a claim to being the first modern European poet to have used [[free verse]], ahead of the French Symbolist [[Gustave Kahn]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol.II, p.349</ref> Macedonski himself later voiced the claim, and referred to such a technique as \"symphonic verse\", \"proteic verse\", or, in honor of composer [[Richard Wagner]], \"Wagnerian verse\".<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.7, 152; Sandqvist, p.199</ref>\n\nWhile editing ''Oltul'', Macedonski also completed his first prose writings. These were the [[Travel writing|travel account]] ''Pompeia \u0219i Sorento'' (\"Pompeia and Sorento\", 1874) and a prison-themed story described by Vianu as \"a tearjerker\", titled ''C\u00e2inele din V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti'' (\"The Dog in V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti\", 1875).<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.419</ref> These were later complemented by other travel works, which critic [[Mihai Zamfir]] likens to the verbal experiments of [[Impressionist literature]], pioneering in the Romanian [[prose poetry]] genre.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> The short comedy ''Gemenii'' was his debut work for the stage, but, according to Vianu, failed to show any merit other than a \"logical construction\" and a preview into Macedonski's use of sarcasm.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452\"/> These writings were followed in 1876 by a concise biography of [[C\u00e2rjaliul]], an early 19th-century [[hajduk]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.419-420</ref> In line with his first Levant-themed poems, Macedonski authored the 1877 story ''A\u0219a se fac banii'' (\"This Is How Money Is Made\", later retold in French as ''Comment on devient riche et puissant'', \"How to Become Rich and Powerful\"), a [[fable]] of [[fatalism]] and the [[Muslim world]]\u2014it dealt with two brothers, one hard-working and one indolent, the latter of whom earns his money through a series of serendipitous events.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.420, 434</ref> Likewise, his [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse comedy]] ''Iade\u0219!'' borrowed its theme from the widely circulated collection of [[Persian literature]] known as ''Sindipa''.<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453</ref> The setting was however modern, and, as noted by French-born critic [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9]], the plot also borrowed much from [[\u00c9mile Augier]]'s ''Gabrielle'' and from other [[morality play]]s of the period.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453\" /> Part of the text was an ironic treatment of youth in [[liberal profession]]s, an attitude which Macedonski fitted in his emerging anti-[[bourgeois]] discourse.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.454-455</ref>\n\nWith the first poems in his ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle, Macedonski still showed his allegiance to Romanticism, and in particular to [[Alphonse de Lamartine]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.398\"/> and the supposed inventor of this theme, [[Alfred de Musset]].<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.16-18, 24-25; C\u0103linescu, p.524; Suciu, p.105-106</ref> ''Noaptea de noiembrie'' opens with a violent condemnation of his adversaries, and sees Macedonski depicting his own funeral.<ref>Anghelescu, p.22-23</ref> The poem is commended by C\u0103linescu, who notes that, in contrast to the \"apparently trivial beginning\", the main part, where Macedonski depicts himself in flight over the [[Danube]], brings the Romanian writer close to the accomplishments of [[Dante Aligheri]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\">C\u0103linescu, p.528</ref> The writer himself claimed that the piece evidenced \"the uttermost breath of inspiration I have ever felt in my life.\"<ref>Anghelescu, p.14</ref> Another poem, ''Noaptea de aprilie'' (\"April Night\"), was probably his testimony of [[unrequited love]] for [[Aristizza Romanescu]].<ref>Nastas\u0103, p.94</ref>\n\n===Realism and Naturalism===\nBy the 1880s, Macedonski developed and applied his \"social poetry\" theory, as branch of [[Literary realism|Realism]]. Explained by the writer himself as a reaction against the legacy of Lamartine,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.398-399</ref> it also signified his brief affiliation with the [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] current, a radical segment of the Realist movement. [[Traian Demetrescu]] thus noted that Macedonski cherished the works of French Naturalists and Realists such as [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[\u00c9mile Zola]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.389, 421. See also Suciu, p.106</ref> During this phase, Macedonski made known his sympathy for the disinherited, from girls forced into prostitution to convicts sentenced to [[penal labor]] on salt mines, and also spoke out against the conventionalism of [[civil marriage]]s.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.524; Vianu, Vol.II, p.398-402</ref> His ''Ocnele'' (\"The Salt Mines\") includes the verdict:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Vai!

What we have all agreed to deem society\nIs far more suited than bandits are for this terrible dwelling!\nState is fiction, and justice\u2014an injustice\nThat leads humanity from a bump down into a rut.}}\n\nNaturalist depiction was also the main element in his prose pieces of the early 1880s. Among them was the first of several [[Sketch story|sketch stories]] using [[still life]] techniques, ''Casa cu nr. 10''<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.420-421, 425-426</ref> (according to Zamfir, a prime sample of Macedonski's \"ornamental\" genre).<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> With ''\u00centre cote\u021be'', ''Dram\u0103 banal\u0103'' and later ''Cometa lui Odorescu'' (\"Odorescu's Comet\"), Macedonski speaks about his own biography.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.426-427</ref> The former has for a protagonist Pandele Vergea, a thirty-five-year-old man who is consumed by an [[Aviculture|avicultural]] obsession, who dreams of turning into a bird, and who is eventually maimed by his overcrowded fowls.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.427-429</ref> In contrast, Dereanu is a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] university student, possessed by dreams of military and political glory, and who meditates about his future in front of Heliade R\u0103dulescu's statue or in Bucharest caf\u00e9s.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.429-430</ref> Also a bohemian, Odorescu announces his discovery of a comet, before being proved wrong by his aunt, an ordinary woman.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.430</ref> Some pieces also double as [[memoir]]s: in ''Dram\u0103 banal\u0103'', the plot revolves around Macedonski's recollection of the 1866 plebiscite.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.423\" /> Vianu draws attention to the [[picturesque]] depiction of [[History of Bucharest|historic Bucharest]], a contributing element in ''Cometa...'', ''Casa cu nr. 10'' and ''\u00centre cote\u021be''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.425-426, 430, 432-433</ref>\n\nWith ''Unchia\u0219ul S\u0103r\u0103cie'' (also written in verse), Macedonski took Naturalist tenets into the field of drama. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9 believed it an imitation of a play by [[Ernest d'Hervilly]] and [[Alfred Gr\u00e9vin]], but, Vianu argues, the Romanian text was only loosely based on theirs: in Macedonski's adaptation, the theme became [[fairy tale]]-like, and used a speech style based on [[Romanian folklore]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.455-456</ref> Around the time of its completion, Macedonski was also working on a similarly loose adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', which notably had the two protagonists die in each other's arms.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.457-458</ref> Another such play is ''3 decemvrie'' (\"December 3\"), which partly retells [[Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner]]'s ''Der 24 Februar'' using Naturalist devices.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.459-462</ref> By contrast, the homage-play ''Cuza-Vod\u0103'' is mainly a Romantic piece, where [[Alexander John Cuza]] finds his political mission validated by legendary figures in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.462\"/>\n\nIn parallel, Macedonski was using poetry to carry out his polemics. In an 1884 [[epigram]], he reacted against Alecsandri's ''[[F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Blanduziei]]'', but, in Vianu's definition, \"his regular causticity seems to be restrained.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.353\"/> The piece he had earlier written, presumably against Eminescu, scandalized the public by mocking the rival's mental ruin:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Un X... pretins poet\u2014acum\nS-a dus pe cel mai jalnic drum...\nL-a\u0219 pl\u00e2nge dac\u0103-n balamuc\nDestinul s\u0103u n-ar fi mai bun\nC\u0103ci p\u00e2n\u0103 ieri a fost n\u0103uc\n\u0218i nu e azi dec\u00e2t nebun.}}<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.354.

Vianu contends that, although Macedonski \"never was familiar with the resigned and patient attitudes\", he was \"by no means an evil man.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.358</ref> On one occasion, the poet defended himself against criticism, noting that the epigram had not been specifically addressed to Eminescu, but had been labeled as such by the press, and claiming to have authored it years before its ''Literatorul'' edition.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.359-360. According to Vianu, Macedonski also stated that poet [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleorm\u0103neanu]] had published the piece without his knowledge, because he liked it and had learned it by heart. Novelist [[I. Peltz]] later claimed that Teleorm\u0103neanu was the poem's real author: {{in lang|ro}} [[Al. S\u0103ndulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/i._peltz_memorialist \"I. Peltz memorialist\"], in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', Nr. 35/2004.</ref> However, the later piece ''Via\u021ba de apoi'' (\"The Afterlife\") still displays resentments he harbored toward Eminescu.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.357</ref>\n\nBy 1880-1884, particularly after the Eminescu scandal, Macedonski envisaged prioritizing French as his language of expression.<ref>Anghelescu, p.11; Vianu, Vol.II, p.361, 362</ref> According to Vianu, Macedonski had traversed \"the lowest point\" of his existence, and had been subject to \"one of the most delicate mysteries of poetic creation.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.363\" /> Among his pieces of the period is the French-language [[sonnet]] ''P\u00e2rle, il me dit alors'' (\"Speak, He Then Said to Me\"), where, Vianu notes, \"one discovers the state of mind of a poet who decides to expatriate himself.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.361\"/>\n\n===Adoption of Symbolism===\n[[File:Fleurs-du-mal ame du vin schlussvignette.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Carlos Schwabe]]'s ''\u00c2me du vin'' (\"Soul of the Wine\"), illustration for [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'']]\n\nAccording to Mihai Zamfir, at the end of his transition from the \"mimetic and egocentric\" verse to Symbolist poetry, Macedonski emerged a \"remarkable, often extraordinary\" author.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> In the early 20th century, fellow poet and critic [[N. Davidescu]] described Macedonski, [[Ion Minulescu]] and other Symbolists from [[Wallachia]] as distinct from their [[Moldavia]]n counterparts in both style and themes.<ref>Cernat, p.17. Cernat notes that the same view is held by Vianu.</ref> Endorsing the theory and practice of Symbolism for much of his life, Macedonski retrospectively claimed to have been one of its first exponents.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Cernat, p.12</ref> His version of Symbolism, critic [[Paul Cernat]] notes, clashed with that advocated by many of his contemporaries in that it rejected merit to the [[Decadent movement]], and represented the \"decorative\" [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] trend of [[Parnassianism|Paranassian]] spirit within the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist current]].<ref>Cernat, p.11-12, 16</ref>\n\nWithin ''Poezia viitorului'', Macedonski invoked as his models to follow some important or secondary Symbolist and Parnassian figures: [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] and [[Jean Mor\u00e9as]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.366</ref> In his review of ''Bronzes'' for ''[[Mercure de France]]'', [[Pierre Quillard]] remarked the \"irreproachable\" technique, but criticized the poet for being too indebted to both Baudelaire and [[Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle|Leconte de Lisle]];<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.371\"/> other Symbolist figures whom Macedonski is known to have borrowed from are [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Heredia]]<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.526\">C\u0103linescu, p.526</ref> and [[Iwan Gilkin]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.413</ref> While undergoing this transition, to what linguist Manuela-Delia Suciu argues is a mostly Parnassian phase,<ref>Suciu, p.107-109</ref> Macedonski was still referencing Naturalism, and considered it compatible with Symbolism.<ref>Krasztev, \"From Modernization...\", p.345</ref>\n\nWith the adoption of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where the focus is on minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up until that moment.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.410\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.410</ref> In his ''Osp\u0103\u021bul lui Pentaur'' (\"The Feast of [[Pentaur]]\"), the poet reflected on civilization itself, as reflected in inanimate opulence.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.410\"/> The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in ''Cartea de aur'', collectively titled ''nuvele f\u0103r\u0103 oameni'' (\"novellas without people\") and compared by C\u0103linescu with the paintings of [[Theodor Aman]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.318, 528</ref>\n\nAlso during that stage, Macedonski was exploring the numerous links between Symbolism, [[mysticism]] and [[esotericism]]. Earlier pieces had already come to explore [[macabre]] themes characteristic for an early branch of Symbolism. Influenced by [[Maurice Rollinat]], they include the somber ''Vaporul mor\u021bii'' (\"The Ship of Death\") and ''Visul fatal'' (\"The Fatal Dream\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.363-364, 412</ref> Likewise, the piece titled ''Imnul lui Satan'' (\"Satan's Hymn\") was placed by critics in connection with ''[[Les Litanies de Satan]]'' (part of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''), but, Vianu argues, the source of Macedonski's satanic themes may have been lodged in his own vision of the world.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.407-408</ref> This interest also reflected in his 1893 ''Saul'', where [[Cincinat Pavelescu]]'s contribution is supposedly minimal.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.463</ref> Echoing satanic themes, [[Ernest Legouv\u00e9]]'s dramatic version of the ''[[Medea]]'' myth (which Macedonski translated at some point in his life)<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.463-464</ref> and the classical work of [[Jean Racine]],<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> it shows the dark powers of political conflict intervening between the eponymous king and his ''[[ephebos]]''-like prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[David]], the latter of whom turns out to be the agent of spiritual revolution.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.464-467</ref>\n\n''{{lang|ro|Noaptea de august}}'' (\"August Night\"), outlines a [[Monism|monistic]] belief probably inspired by [[Rosicrucianism]], stressing the unity between soul and matter and depicting Macedonski's own journey into a transcendental space.<ref>Krasztev, \"From a Deadlocked Present...\", p.43</ref> Following the examples of Baudelaire's ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', but also echoing his readings from [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], Macedonski left poems dealing with [[narcotic]]s and [[substance abuse]], at least some of which reflected his personal experience with [[nicotine]] and possibly other unnamed drugs.<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /> Also at that stage, Macedonski also began publishing the \"instrumentalist\" series of his Symbolist poems. This form of [[Experimental literature|experimental poem]] was influenced by the theories of [[Ren\u00e9 Ghil]]<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol.II, p.366, 413-415</ref> and verified through his encounter with [[Remy de Gourmont]]'s views.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.413-415</ref> In parallel, it reaffirmed Macedonski's personal view that music and the spoken word were intimately related (a perspective notably attested by his 1906 interview with [[Jules Combarieu]]).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.341-342\"/> Romanian critic [[Petre R\u0103ileanu]] theorized that such elements evidenced Macedonski's transition to \"[[metaliterature]]\".<ref name=\"Sandqvist, p.200\"/> On a different level, they echoed an older influence, that of [[Gottfried August B\u00fcrger]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.526\" />\n\n===''Excelsior''===\nDespite having stated his interest in innovation, Macedonski generally displayed a more conventional style in his ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'' volume. It included ''Noaptea de mai'', which Vianu sees as \"one of the [vernacular's] most beautiful poems\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.363\" /> and as evidence of \"a clear joy, without any torment whatsoever\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.408</ref> A celebration of spring partly evoking folkloric themes, it was made famous by the recurring [[refrain]], ''Veni\u021bi: privighetoarea c\u00e2nt\u0103 \u0219i liliacul e-nflorit'' (\"Come along: the nightingale is singing and the lilac is in blossom\").<ref>Anghelescu, p.20-21</ref> Like ''Noaptea de mai'', ''Lewki'' (named after and dedicated to the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]]), depicts intense joy, completed in this case by what Vianu calls \"the restorative touch of nature.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.409\"/> The series also returned to [[Levant]] settings and [[Islam]]ic imagery, particularly in ''Ac\u0219am dovalar'' (named after the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] version of ''[[Witr]]'').<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /> Also noted within the volume is his short \"Modern [[Psalms]]\" series, including the piece ''Iertare'' (\"Forgiveness\"), which is addressed to God:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Iertare!

Ornea]] argues, was one of the meeting points between Macedonski and ''Junimism''.<ref>Ornea, p.263</ref> In what is seen as its most acid section, the text notably reads:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|M-am n\u0103scut \u00een ni\u0219te zile c\u00e2nd t\u00e2mpita burghezime\nDin tejghea f\u0103c\u00e2nd tribun\u0103, legiune de co\u021bcari,\nPune-o talp\u0103 noroioas\u0103 pe popor \u0219i boierime,\nZile c\u00e2nd se-mparte \u021bara \u00een c\u0103l\u0103i \u0219i \u00een victime\n\u0218i c\u00e2nd steagul libert\u0103\u021bii e purtat de c\u00e2rciumari.}}<ref>Anghelescu, p.21; Vianu, Vol.II, p.368</ref>\n|\nI was born into days when the moronic bourgeoisie\nTurning counters into rostrums, a legion of knaves,\nPlaces a muddy sole on the people and the boyars,\nDays when the country is divided into hangmen and victims\nAnd when the flag of liberty is carried by publicans.}}\n\nAt the same time as being engaged in his most violent polemics, Macedonski produced meditative and serene poems, which were later judged to be among his best. ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' is the synthesis of his main themes and influences, rated by commentators as his \"masterpiece\".<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.527; Vianu, Vol.II, p.410</ref> Partly based on an earlier poem (''Meka'', named after the [[Mecca|Arab city]]),<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref>Anghelescu, p.25</ref> it tells the story of an [[emir]], who, left unsatisfied by the shallow and opulent life he leads in [[Baghdad]], decides to leave on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]]. While critics agree that it is to be read as an [[allegory]] of Macedonski's biography, the ironic text does not make it clear whether the emir actually reaches his target, nor if the central [[metaphor]] of Mecca as a [[mirage]] means that the goal is not worth sacrificing for.<ref name=\"elrseisl\" /><ref>Anghelescu, p.25-26, 30-31; Perpessicius, p.63; Sandqvist, p.201</ref> While [[Mircea Anghelescu]] comments that Macedonski illustrates \"unusual tension\" by rigorously amplifying references to the color red, seen as a symbol of suffering,<ref>Anghelescu, p.26</ref> C\u0103linescu notes that the sequence of lyrics has a studied \"delirious\" element, and illustrates this with the quote:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|\u0218i el e emirul, \u0219i toate le are...\nE t\u00e2n\u0103r, e farmec, e tr\u0103snet, e zeu,\nDar zilnic se simte furat de-o visare...\nSpre Meka se duce cu g\u00e2ndul mereu,\n\u0218i-n fa\u021ba dorin\u021bei\u2014ce este\u2014dispare\nIar el e emirul, \u0219i toate le are.}}<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.527\"/>\n|\nAnd he is the emir, and he owns each thing...\nHe's young, he's a charm, he's a bolt, he's a god,\nBut in each day he feels he is swept by a dream...\nTowards Mecca his thought races constantly,\nAnd faced with the wish, all things disappear,\nAnd he is the emir, and he owns each thing.}}\n\n===Late prose works===\nIn prose, his focus shifted back to the purely descriptive, or led Alexandru Macedonski into the realm of [[fantasy literature]]. These stories, most of which were eventually collected in ''Cartea de aur'', include memoirs of his childhood in the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia]] region, nostalgic portrayals of the [[Oltenia]]n [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] environment, idealized depictions of Cuza's reign, as well as a retrospective view on the [[Slavery in Romania|end of Rom slavery]] (found in his piece ''Verig\u0103 \u021biganul'', \"Verig\u0103 the Gypsy\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.422-424, 431-432</ref> The best known among them is ''Pe drum de po\u0219t\u0103'', a [[third-person narrative]] and thinly disguised memoir, where the characters are an adolescent Alexandru Macedonski and his father, [[Alexandru D. Macedonski|General Macedonski]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.334, 424-425, 427</ref> The idyllic outlook present in such stories is one of the common meeting points between his version of Symbolism and traditionalist authors such as [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]].<ref>Cernat, p.19; Vianu, Vol.II, p.431, 432</ref> Vianu indicates the connection, but adds: \"Macedonski descended, through memory, in the world of the village, with the tremor of regret for the peace and plenty of the old settlements, so well polished that each person, landowner as well as peasant, lived within a framework that nature itself seemed to have granted. [...] in depicting rural environments, Macedonski presents the point of view of a [[Conservatism|conservative]].\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.432</ref>\n\n''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]'', a fantasy novel and extended [[Prose poetry|prose poem]], was celebrated by Macedonski's disciple [[Oreste Georgescu]] as \"the new religion of humanity\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.377</ref> The volume carried the mocking dedication \"To France, this [[Chaldea]]\" (thought by Vianu to reference P\u00e9ladan's views on the decay of civilization).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.436\"/> It has affinities with writings by the Italian [[Decadent movement|Decadent]] author [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]],<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.528; Cernat, p.89; Vianu, Vol.II, p.436-437, 444</ref> as well as echoes from [[Anatole France]].<ref name=\"mds106\">Suciu, p.106</ref> The hero Thalassa, a Greek boy, works as a [[lighthouse]]-keeper on Snake Island, fantasizing about the [[golden age]] of mankind.<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/><ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.440-441</ref> His fate is changed by a shipwreck, during which a girl, Caliope, reaches the island's shore. Thalassa and Caliope fall in love, but are mysteriously unable to seal their union through sexual intercourse: the boy attributes this failure to the \"curse\" of human individuality. Seeking to achieve a perfect union with his lover, he eventually kills her and drowns himself in the [[Black Sea]].<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/><ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.441-442; Suciu, p.106-107</ref>\n\nIn her review for ''[[Mercure de France]]'', novelist [[Rachilde]] argued: \"Very difficult to read, entirely developed in Symbolist manner [and] almost impossible to recount, obviously written in French but nevertheless obviously conceived by a Romanian (and what a spirited Romanian!).\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.438-439\"/> Rachilde believed the work to display \"the fragrance of Oriental spices [...] rose marmalade and a slice of bear meat.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.439</ref> According to Vianu, the book builds on Macedonski's earlier themes, replacing Naturalist observation with a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation about [[idealism]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.442-444</ref> One other aspect of Macedonski's stylistic exploration took him to attempt recording [[synesthesia]]. His manuscript is written in ink of several colors, which, he believed, was to help readers get a full sense of its meaning.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol. II, p.445</ref> Like other synesthetic aspects of his novel, this is believed to have been inspired by the techniques of Baudelaire<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199; Vianu, Vol. II, p.445</ref> and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].<ref>R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199</ref>\n\n''Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu'' is noted for its numerous cultural references, and especially for using a wide range of metaphors. Such aspects have been reviewed negatively by modern critics. Tudor Vianu writes: \"the poet makes such waste of gemstones that we feel like saying some of them must be false\",<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.444</ref> while C\u0103linescu, who notes that some fragments reveal \"an incomparable artist\" and \"a professional metaphorist\", notes that \"in the end, such virtuosities become a bore.\"<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\" /> According to Manuela-Delia Suciu, ''Thalassa'' is \"prolix\" and \"too polished\",<ref name=\"mds106\"/> traits believed by Zamfir to be less irritating in the Romanian version.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> Critic Cornel Moraru found that, in the background, ''Thalassa'', a \"great Symbolist novel\", confronts [[Greek mythology|Ancient Greek]] and [[Christian mythology]], but \"abuses\" the religious vocabulary.<ref name=\"cmmareroman\"/> Another part of the novel's imagery is [[Erotic literature|erotic]], and includes an elaborate and aestheticized description of male genitalia.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/index.php?section=rubrici&article_id=35631 \"Sex \u00een scris, sex de scris!\"], in ''[[Jurnalul Na\u021bional]]'', October 9, 2005</ref>\n\nThe four-act [[tragicomedy]] ''Le Fou?'' is seen by Vianu as comparable in subject matter and depth to ''[[Enrico IV]]'', a celebrated 1922 play by [[Luigi Pirandello]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.378, 470-471</ref> The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance of the fact that people saw in him an eccentric.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.378, 467-468, 470, 472</ref> The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to the point where he sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with [[dissociative identity disorder]], Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.469-470</ref> Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.471</ref> The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.529\" /> At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of [[capitalism]], and, using Parisian [[argot]], makes allusive references to famous people of the day.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.471-472</ref>\n\nParticularly during the 1890s, Macedonski was a follower of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and of [[Gothic fiction]] in general, producing a Romanian version of Poe's ''[[Metzengerstein]]'' story, urging his own disciples to translate other such pieces, and adopting \"Gothic\" themes in his original prose.<ref>Thomas C. Carlson, \"Poe in Romania\", in Lois Vines (ed.), ''Poe Abroad. Influence, Reputation, Affinities'', [[University of Iowa Press]], Iowa City, 1999, p.77.  {{ISBN|0-87745-697-6}}</ref> Indebted to [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]], Macedonski also wrote a number of [[science fiction]] stories, including the 1913 ''Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought'', which depicts civilization on the verge of a crisis.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.421-421, 435-436</ref> The gigantic commercial ship is maintained by a banker's union, and designed to grant travelers access to every pleasure imaginable; this causes the working-class inhabited cities on the continent to fall into a state of neglect and permanent violence, the climax of the story occurring with the bankers' decision to destroy their creation.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, 435-436</ref> ''Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought'' is noted for anticipating [[television]], the ship being equipped with electrically-operated \"large and clear mirrors\" that display \"images from various parts of the Earth\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, 435</ref> Macedonski was by then interested in the development of cinema, and authored a [[silent film]] screenplay based on ''Comment on devient riche et puissant''.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.448</ref>\n\n===Final transition=== \n[[File:Frederic Leighton - Dante in Exile.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dante in Exile'', 1864 painting by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]]]]\nLate in his life, Macedonski had come to reject Symbolist tenets, defining them as \"imbecilities\" designed for \"the uncultured\".<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.526\" /> ''Ultima verba'', the very last poems to be written by him, show him coming to terms with himself, and are treasured for their serene or intensely joyous vision of life and human accomplishment.<ref>Anghelescu, p.29-31; C\u0103linescu, p.527; Vianu, Vol.II, p.385</ref> The [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]] written at this stage, known collectively as ''[[Poema rondelurilor]]'', are one of the first instances where the technique is used locally. Like those written previously by ''Literatorul''{{'}}s Pavelescu and [[Alexandru Obedenaru]], they are based on an earlier motif present in Macedonski's work, that of recurring refrains.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419\">Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419</ref> Many of the pieces document the poet's final discoveries. One of them is ''Rondelul crinilor'' (\"The Rondel of the Lilies\"), which proclaims fragrances as the source of beatitude: ''\u00cen crini e be\u021bia cea rar\u0103'', \"In lilies one finds that exceptional drunkenness\".<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /><ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.527\"/> According to [[\u0218tefan Cazimir]], ''Rondelul ora\u0219ului mic'' (\"The Rondel of the Small Town\") shows a \"likable wave of irony and self-irony\", and the poet himself coming to terms with \"the existence of a world who ignores him.\"<ref name=\"stcantxvii\" /> Proof of his combativeness was still to be found in ''Rondelul contimporanilor'' (\"The Rondel of the Contemporaries\").<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.473-474</ref>\n\nThe poet's take on life is also outlined in his final play, ''Moartea lui Dante''. C\u0103linescu writes that, by then, Macedonski was \"obsessed\" with the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\">C\u0103linescu, p.528</ref> Macedonski identifies with his hero, [[Dante Aligheri]], and formulates his own poetic testament while identifying [[World War I]] Romania with the medieval [[Republic of Florence]].<ref>Anghelescu, p.13; C\u0103linescu, p.523, 529; Vianu, Vol.II, p.474-479</ref> Tudor Vianu remarks: \"In Dante's great self-pride, Macedonski found his own.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.476</ref> He sees the play as the best such work to have been produced by Macedonski,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.478-479, 482</ref> whereas C\u0103linescu deems it \"puerile\".<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.529\"/> Zamfir believes ''Moartea...'' to be a significant text in Macedonski's bibliography, \"one of the first samples of Romanian Symbolist theater\", and as such indebted mainly to Maeterlinck.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/> Vianu argues that the play may document the Romanian writer's late rejection of France, through the protagonist's statement: \"the French are a gentle people, but their soul is different from mine.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.477</ref>\n\nA number of rondels show Macedonski's late fascination with the [[Far East]], China and Japan. George C\u0103linescu believes that this is to be understood as one item in a large [[antithesis]], the other being Decadent Paris, which one rondel describes as \"hell\".<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\" /> The Orient, viewed as the space of serenity, is believed by Macedonski to be peopled by toy-like women and absent [[opium]]-smokers, and to be kept orderly by a stable [[meritocracy]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.528\" /> The Chinese-themed poem ''Tsing-Ly-Tsi'', which Cazimir notes for its discreet, \"almost imperceptible\", humor, reads:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ro|Tsing-Ly-Tsi st\u0103-n prispa de-aur,\nCu ochi mici ca de ghierlan,\nSub de-argint frunzos tezaur,\nCasa e de por\u021belan.}}<ref name=\"stcantxvii\" />\n|\nTsing-Ly-Tsi sits on the golden porch,\nWith his eyes as small as those of mice,\nUnder the silvery, leafy, treasure,\nHis house is porcelain-like.}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Macedonski's school and its early impact===\n[[File:Alexandru Macedonski, Alexis & Oreste Georgescu.JPG|thumb|250px|Alexandru Macedonski (seated, to the right) facing [[Oreste Georgescu]].

The first such figure was ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[Titu Maiorescu]], who believed him to be a minor author, referring to him only a couple of times in his books and usually ridiculing him in his articles.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>C\u0103linescu, p.407, 412; Ornea, p.117; Vianu, Vol.II, p.243, 356</ref> One of these texts, the 1886 essay ''Poe\u021bi \u0219i critici'' (\"Poets and Critics\"), spoke of Macedonski as having \"vitiated\" poetry, a notion he also applied to [[Constantin D. Aricescu]] and [[Aron Densu\u0219ianu]].<ref>Ornea, p.117</ref> Especially radical pronouncements were left by the traditionalist authors [[Ilarie Chendi]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Chendi wrote of Macedonski being \"the caricature of a man\", having \"a feverish mind\" and being motivated by \"the brutal instinct of revenge\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.391. According to C\u0103linescu (p.638): \"Chendi lacks even the faintest intuition of Macedonski's poetry.\"</ref> Iorga, who became better known as a historian, later retracted some of the statements he had made against the poet during the 1890s.<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.15\"/> Among the younger prominent traditionalist writers was the [[Transylvania]]n-born [[Lucian Blaga]], who may have purposefully avoided Macedonski during his first visit to Bucharest in 1920.<ref>Balot\u0103, p.42</ref> Although more sympathetic to the Symbolist author, both Dragomirescu and [[Gheorghe Adamescu]] tended to describe him as exclusively the product of French and Decadent literature,<ref name=\"Anghelescu, p.15\" /> while Dragomirescu's disciple [[Ion Trivale]] denied all merit to Macedonski's literature.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.644</ref>\n\nAccording to Tudor Vianu, Macedonski's intellectual friends (among them [[Anghel Demetriescu]], [[George Ionescu-Gion]], [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], [[Grigore Tocilescu]] and [[V. A. Urechia]]) were largely responsible for passing down \"a better and truer image of the abused poet.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.388-389</ref> It was also due to Dragomirescu that ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' was included in a literature textbook for final grade high school students, which some argue is the poet's first-ever presence in the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]].<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.380. According to Anghelescu (p.15), this was preceded by an 1891 textbook published by educator E. Manliu, which introduced Macedonski through his ''Calul arabului''.</ref> According to historian Lucian Nastas\u0103, the poet's wife Ana Rallet behaved like an \"excellent secretary\" while Macedonski was still alive, and thereafter helped sort and edit his manuscript while maintaining \"an actual cult\" for her husband.<ref>Nastas\u0103, p.146</ref>\n\nMacedonski's [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] circle was the center of a literary alternative to the prevailing conservatism and Eminescu-like traditionalism of the day, the latter tendency being grouped around ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' magazine for part of Macedonski's lifetime.<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Cernat, p.10-11, 15, 18; Ornea, p.136-137; Sandqvist, p.75, 197, 200, 202</ref> While Macedonski himself maintained his links with Romanticism and Classicism, commentators have retrospectively recognized in him the main person who announced Romania's first wave in [[modernist literature]].<ref name=\"mzrivalul\"/><ref>Anghelescu, p.139-140; Cernat, p.10-11, 15; Krasztev, \"From Modernization...\", p.334, 338, 343; Sandqvist, p.197, 200; Vianu, Vol.II, p.483</ref> Many first-generation disciples were to part with his guidelines early on, either by radicalizing their Symbolism or by stepping out of its confines. [[Traian Demetrescu]] was one of the first to do so, focusing on his commitment to [[socialism]]\u2014Vianu notes that the split took place \"without coldness and the heart's versatility\" on Macedonski's part.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.391</ref> Literary researcher [[Lidia Bote]] argues that it was Petic\u0103 who first illustrated mature Symbolism, emancipating himself from Macedonski's [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] tendencies after 1902.<ref>Cernat, p.15</ref> By that time, the Symbolist authors [[Dimitrie Anghel]] and [[N. D. Cocea]] used Macedonski's fantasy prose as an inspiration for their own, and [[N. Davidescu]] was borrowing from his mystical discourse.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.690, 697, 919</ref> The pictorial and joyous elements in Macedonski's poems were also serving to inspire Stamatiad, [[Eugeniu \u0218tef\u0103nescu-Est]] and [[Horia Furtun\u0103]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.700-701, 727</ref> In the early stages of his career, [[Ion Pillat]] wrote pieces which echo his master's choice of [[Exoticism|exotic]] themes.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.857-858</ref> A more discreet legacy of Macedonski's ideas was also preserved inside the conservative and traditionalist camps. Although his separation from ''Literatorul'' was drastic, and led him to rally with ''Junimea'', [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] built on some elements borrowed from the magazine's ideology, incorporating them into his literary vision.<ref>Ornea, p.263-264; Vianu, Vol.II, p.432</ref>\n\nMany of Macedonski's most devoted disciples, whom he himself had encouraged, have been rated by various critics as secondary or mediocre. This is the case of [[Theodor Cornel]] (who made his name as an art critic),<ref>Cernat, p.45-46</ref> [[Mircea Demetriade]],<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /><ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.388\"</ref> [[Oreste Georgescu]],<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.652-653</ref> [[Alexandru Obedenaru]],<ref name=\"aonarco22\" /><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419\" /> Stoenescu, Stamatiad, [[Carol Scrob]], [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] and [[Donar Munteanu]].<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.523, 531-532, 701-702</ref> Another such minor author was the self-styled \"[[hermeticist]]\" [[Alexandru Petroff]], who expanded on Macedonski's ideas about esoteric knowledge.<ref name=\"Cernat, p.11\"/>\n\nMacedonski's eldest son [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] continued to pursue a career as a painter. His son [[Soare Macedonski|Soare]] followed in his footsteps, receiving acclaim from art critics of the period.

His image acquired mythical proportions for his followers. Like Demetrescu, many of them left memoirs on Macedonski which were published before or after his death. His admirers were writing poetry about him as early as 1874,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.342</ref> and, in 1892, [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] published a rhapsodizing portrait of Macedonski as \"the Artist\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.387</ref> Pavelescu, Dragoslav and Petic\u0103 paid homage to the writer by leaving recollections which describe him as a devoted and considerate friend.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.390</ref> In contrast, traditionalist poet [[Alexandru Vlahu\u021b\u0103]] authored an 1889 [[sketch story]] in which Macedonski (referred to as ''Polidor'') is the object of derision.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.558; Vianu, Vol.II, p.386-387.

A native of [[New Bern, North Carolina]], Mann played [[college football]] at [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] in 1942 and 1943 and at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1944, 1946 and 1947. Playing the [[End (American football)|end]] position, he broke the [[Big Ten Conference]] record for receiving yardage in 1946 and again in 1947. After going undrafted in the [[1948 NFL Draft]], Mann would sign his first professional football contract with the [[Detroit Lions]], where he played for two seasons. He would later player for the [[Green Bay Packers]] for parts of five seasons until 1954. Mann was the first African American player for both teams.\n\nMann led the NFL in receiving yardage (1,014 yards) and yards per reception (15.4) in 1949. Mann was asked to take a pay cut after the 1949 season and became a hold out when the Lions opened practice in July 1950. He was traded to the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] in August 1950 and released three weeks later. Mann charged that he had been \"railroaded\" out of professional football for refusing to take a pay cut. He signed with the Green Bay Packers near the end of the [[1950 NFL season]] and was the team's leading receiver in 1951. He remained with the Packers through the 1954 season. After his football career, Mann became a lawyer and practiced law in [[Detroit]]. He was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and died in October 2006 at the age of 82.\n\n==Early years==\nBob Mann was born in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], the county seat of [[Craven County, North Carolina]], in 1924.<ref name=NB>{{cite news |last=Bryant|first=Arabelle|title=New Bern's Mann established several sports firsts |newspaper=[[Sun Journal (New Bern, North Carolina)|Sun Journal]]|date=January 16, 2010 |access-date=November 21, 2019 |url=http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119021815/http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |archive-date=January 19, 2010 }}</ref> At the time of his childhood, New Bern was a small town of about 10,000 and was still segregated.<ref name=\"PIONEER\">{{Cite news | first = Bill| last = Dow| title = Mann pioneer player in NFL: Part 2| date = January 11, 2002| access-date = November 22, 2019| url-status=live |newspaper = [[Detroit Free Press]]| page = 8D| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191122153540/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-date = November 22, 2019| via = [[Newspapers.com]]|type=clipping}}</ref> His father, William Mann, was a physician, and his mother, Clara Mann, was a supervisor of Craven County elementary schools.

A native of [[New Bern, North Carolina]], Mann played [[college football]] at [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] in 1942 and 1943 and at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1944, 1946 and 1947. Playing the [[End (American football)|end]] position, he broke the [[Big Ten Conference]] record for receiving yardage in 1946 and again in 1947. After going undrafted in the [[1948 NFL Draft]], Mann would sign his first professional football contract with the [[Detroit Lions]], where he played for two seasons. He would later player for the [[Green Bay Packers]] for parts of five seasons until 1954. Mann was the first African American player for both teams.\n\nMann led the NFL in receiving yardage (1,014 yards) and yards per reception (15.4) in 1949. Mann was asked to take a pay cut after the 1949 season and became a hold out when the Lions opened practice in July 1950. He was traded to the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] in August 1950 and released three weeks later. Mann charged that he had been \"railroaded\" out of professional football for refusing to take a pay cut. He signed with the Green Bay Packers near the end of the [[1950 NFL season]] and was the team's leading receiver in 1951. He remained with the Packers through the 1954 season. After his football career, Mann became a lawyer and practiced law in [[Detroit]]. He was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and died in October 2006 at the age of 82.\n\n==Early years==\nBob Mann was born in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], the county seat of [[Craven County, North Carolina]], in 1924.<ref name=NB>{{cite news |last=Bryant|first=Arabelle|title=New Bern's Mann established several sports firsts |newspaper=[[Sun Journal (New Bern, North Carolina)|Sun Journal]]|date=January 16, 2010 |access-date=November 21, 2019 |url=http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119021815/http://www.newbernsj.com/news/mann-59214-bern-new.html |archive-date=January 19, 2010 }}</ref> At the time of his childhood, New Bern was a small town of about 10,000 and was still segregated.<ref name=\"PIONEER\">{{Cite news | first = Bill| last = Dow| title = Mann pioneer player in NFL: Part 2| date = January 11, 2002| access-date = November 22, 2019| url-status=live |newspaper = [[Detroit Free Press]]| page = 8D| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191122153540/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24262964/mann_end_was_one_of_1st_black_lions/| archive-date = November 22, 2019| via = [[Newspapers.com]]|type=clipping}}</ref> His father, William Mann, was a physician, and his mother, Clara Mann, was a supervisor of Craven County elementary schools.
