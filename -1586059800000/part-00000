Egbert Gheeraerts was a painter who had moved from an unknown location to Bruges. Some scholars believe that Gheeraerts' [[patronymic]] indicates that he likely came from the Northern Netherlands. His wife Antonine, on the other hand, was a native of Bruges. Egbert became a master of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] of Bruges on 20 January 1516.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Houghton Typ 530.67.124 - De Dene, 72.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''The flatterer's nature has an animal color'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'', Bruges 1567]]\n\nThe exact date of birth of Marcus Gheeraerts is not known. On the basis of archival sources about the life of his father, it can be deduced that he was born between 1516 and 1521.<ref name=thyb/> Not long after her husband's death, Marcus' mother remarried Simon Pieters, who was also a painter and probably a native of the Northern Netherlands. The couple had six children with whom Marcus was raised.  This explains why he was sometimes referred to as Marcus Pieters. After the death of his stepfather Simon Pieters in early 1557, Marcus Gheeraerts became the guardian of his half-brothers and sisters. Marcus's mother died on 8 August 1580.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The lamentation of Christ.jpeg|thumb|260px|''The lamentation of Christ'']]\n\nThe master or masters of Marcus Gheeraerts are not known. The most obvious candidate is his stepfather Simon Pieters. Art historians believe that he started his training with Simon Pieters and later worked in the workshop of his guardian [[Albert Cornelis]]. It is speculated that he may have had other masters but there is no agreement as to their identity.  He likely trained outside Bruges to learn the craft of engraver, which was not generally practised at a high level in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThere is no information about Gheeraerts in the registers of the Sint-Lucas guild in Bruges for the period from 1522 to 1549.  This absence has been interpreted as an indication that he left his hometown to study in Antwerp or abroad. From 1558 onwards a number of documents demonstrate that Gheeraerts was resident in Bruges. On 31 July 1558, he entered the artisan and saddle maker's guild of Bruges as a master painter. In the same year, he was elected second board member of the guild, suggesting that he already enjoyed considerable professional recognition. From April to September 1561 Gheeraerts was the first board member.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nOn 3 June 1558, Marcus Gheeraerts married Johanna Struve. The couple had three children, of whom two are known by name, a son later referred to as Marcus the Younger and a daughter called Esther. A third child died at a young age and was buried in 1561.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nGheeraerts developed a professional career as a painter, etcher and designer. He was active as a designer of heraldic motifs. On 10 September 1559, he was commissioned to provide designs for the tombs of [[Mary of Burgundy]] and [[Charles the Bold]] in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges. He drew the patterns for the lavishly decorated metal ornaments, the colorful coats of arms and two copper angels that were attached to the sides of the tombs.  In 1561 Marcus Gheeraerts was commissioned to complete a triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter [[Bernard van Orley]]. The painting had remained unfinished after van Orley's death in 1542. Originally intended for the church of the monastery of Brou near Bourg-en-Bresse (Ain department, France), which Margaret of Austria had built, the triptych was transferred to Bruges after her death. Gheeraerts completed it.  [[Margaret of Parma]] later decided to place the triptych in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[Image:Marcus Gheeraerts I (Attr) - Composite rotting head of a monk representing an allegory of iconoclasm.jpg|left|thumb|230px|''Allegory of Iconoclasm''<ref>Although not particularly sympathetic to the Calvinist iconoclasts, it is mainly critical of the Catholic Church. The etching may have been the main reason why Gheeraerts had to flee to England in 1568. (British Museum, Dept. of Print and Drawings, 1933.1.1..3, see also Edward Hodnett: ''Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder'', Utrecht 1971, pp. 26-7)</ref>]]\n\nGheeraerts was further commissioned in 1561 to make a print depicting a map of his hometown. He completed the work in one year. The map is one of the earliest examples of a perspective city map that is correctly displayed.<ref name=thyb/>  It is during this period that Gheeraerts most likely painted the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] (collection of the Memling museum in Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges).<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts became involved in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] community in Bruges and became a leader of the local church community.  Whereas Calvinism was initially tolerated, the religious persecution of [[Calvinist]]s commenced in 1567 with the arrival of new governor of the Low Countries, the [[Duke of Alva]].  In 1566 he participated in protests against the arrest of Calvinists in Bruges. He reflected in his art on the religious turmoil and [[iconoclasm]] of his time.  As a Calvinist and artist he seemed to have had mixed feelings about the Iconoclasm of his religious group: he condemned idolatry of images but did not agree with the wholesale destruction of religious images by the Iconoclasts.  In 1566 or shortly after, he created a print referred to as the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' that shows a composite rotting head of a monk.  The head appears to rise up from a rocky outcropping. Myriad little figures swarm over the rocks. They enact 22 different scenes that used to be denoted by alphabetical keys which have not survived.<ref name=duke>Alastair Duke: Chapter ''Calvinists and 'papist idolatry': the mentality of the image-breakers in 1566'' in ''Dissident Identities in the Early Modern Low Countries'', Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2009, pp 196-197</ref>  Inside the gaping mouth a diabolical mass is celebrated. On the pate of the head sits a pope-like figure under a canopy on a throne surrounded by bishops and monks. [[Indulgences]] and rosaries are pinned up on the staves and various rituals and processions take place and are labelled with letters. In the foreground Protestant iconoclasts are smashing altarpieces, religious sculptures, other church-related items and hurling them into a fire.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=1067484001&objectId=1429361&partId=1 Marcus Gheeraerts I (Attributed), ''Composite rotting head of a monk representing an allegory of iconoclasm''] in the British Museum</ref><ref name=green>David Freedberg, ''Art and iconoclasm, 1525-1580 The case of the Northern Netherlands'', J.P.

His wife and daughter remained in Bruges. The verdict in his case was pronounced at the end of 1568.  He was convicted and the punishment was permanent banishment and forfeiture of his entire fortune.\n\nGheeraerts took up residence in London upon his arrival in England in 1568. He was joined by his daughter in May 1571 likely after her mother had died.  After the death of his wife in Bruges, the artist married in England his second wife, Sussanah de Critz.  His wife was a sister of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I's]] [[serjeant-painter]], [[John de Critz]], another Flemish painter who had fled to England.The couple had two daughters and one son.  The only child surviving into adulthood, Sarah, later married the famous French-born English [[limner]] [[Isaac Oliver]].  Just as before in Bruges, Gheeraerts made drawings and etchings and continued his painting activities.  As there was a keen demand for portrait paintings in England, Gheeraerts started to paint portraits, which he had not done while still in Flanders.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nArt historians do not agree as to whether Gheeraerts returned to his native Flanders around 1577 to continue his career in [[Antwerp]].  In 1577 a 'Mercus Geeraert Painter' was registered as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp and paid registration fees for the years 1585 and 1586.  It is not clear whether this Mercus referred to Marcus the Elder or to Marcus the Younger. Some art historians believe that Marcus the Elder registered in the Antwerp Guild in order to be able to legally work with Antwerp printers for the publications on which he worked.  Others believe that he actually worked in Antwerp and point to the various publications printed in Antwerp on which he collaborated.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts had various pupils during his career. In 1563, 13-year-old Melchior d'Assoneville became an apprentice of Gheeraerts in Bruges. Melchior d\u2019Assoneville later became a sculptor and decorative painter and while living in [[Mechelen]] he was the master of Hendrik Faydherbe. His workshop assistant Philipus de la Valla who fled with him to England may also have been a pupil of Gheeraerts although he is sometimes referraed to in contemporary records as a servant.  It is not certain whether Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder was the teacher of his son Marcus the Younger. There are different views on this, but it is likely that he was but that his son also received training with other artists, who may have included other Flemish emigrants in England, such as [[Lucas de Heere]] and [[John de Critz]].\n \nThe date of death of Gheeraerts is not known but it must have been before 1599.<ref name=thyb/>\n\n==Work==\n===General===\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Procession of the Knights of the Garter (6).jpeg|thumb|330px|''Procession of the Knights of the Garter'']]\nGheeraerts was a painter, draughtsman, print designer, etcher and ornamemtal designer.  As many of his paintings were lost as a result of the Iconoclasm of the 16th century, he is now mainly known for his work as a printmaker and print designer. He was a keen innovator and experimented with [[etching]] at a time when [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] were dominant techniques. For example, his 1562 birds-eye view of the town of [[Bruges]] was etched on 10 different plates, and the resulting map measures 100 x 177&nbsp;cm.<ref name=map>[https://www.verrijkjekijkopbrugge.be/2017/12/08/de-koperplaten-van-de-kaart-van-marcus-gerards De koperplaten van de kaart van Marcus Gerards], 8 December 2017 {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n===Paintings===\nVery few paintings have been attributed to Gheeraerts with much certainty. He did not sign any of his paintings.  It is documented that he finished the triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter Bernard van Orley. The triptych was later damaged during the period of Iconoclasm and largely repainted in 1589 by [[Frans Pourbus the Younger]] during restoration work. It is not clear from the current state of the work, which parts were painted by which painter. It has been suggested that Bernard van Orley started the centre of the panel and that Marcus Gheeraerts completed the outer areas. A replica of the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The lamentation of Christ.jpeg|scene of ''The lamentation of Christ'']] appeared on the art market (Hampel Fine Art sale of 27 June 2019, lot 551) and was attributed to Gheeraerts.  Another version of the Lamentation also attributed to Gheeraerts is in the Saint Amands Church of [[Geel]].<ref name=ham>[https://www.hampel-auctions.com/o/online-catalogue-detail.html?la=en&a=119&s=656&id=1140&acl=1190541 Marcus Gheeraerts I, ''The lamentation of Christ''] at Hampel Fine Art auctions</ref> \n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Map of Bruges - Peeing woman.jpg|thumb|270px|left|''Urinating woman'' from the map of Bruges]]\n\nThe panel of the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] (Memling museum in Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges) has been attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts. The [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Lazarus and the rich man.jpeg|''Lazarus and the rich man'']] (Catharijneconvent Museum in Utrecht) has been attributed to Gheeraerts but this attribution is not uncontested.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nGheeraerts the Elder was known as a portrait painter.  The traditional attribution to Gheeraerts of the [[:File:Elizabeth I of England Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder.jpg|''Portrait of Elizabeth I of England'']], also referred to as the ''Peace portrait'' is still a matter of contention. The monogram \u201cM.G.F.\u201d on the portrait can apply to both Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder and his son Marcus the Younger. Some art historians regard it as a collaboration of father and son Gheeraerts. A [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Portrait of Prince William I of Orange.JPG|''Portrait of Prince William I of Orange'']] ([[Blair Castle]], Scotland) has also been attributed to Gheeraerts.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nTwo works depicting celebrations, the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - Festival at Bermondsey c. 1569.jpg|''F\u00eate at Bermondsey'']] and [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - A Village Festival.jpg|''A village festival'']] ([[Hatfield House]], Herefordshire), England), formerly attributed to Flemish artist [[Joris Hoefnagel]], were attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder in 2015.<ref>Edward Town, ''\"A f\u00eate at Bermondsey\" an English landscape by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder'', The Burlington magazine 157.2015,1346, 309-317</ref>  An inscription on the first painting indicates it was painted on commission by the Flemish merchant Jacob Hoefnagel, a brother of Joris Hoefnagel and a resident of London.  The inscription also mentions that Jacob Hoefnagel wanted the picture to depict all the fashions that could be seen in England.  Gheeraerts followed this instruction by depicting the figures in costumes from England, France, Venice and other European countries.  These costumes were based on a publication depicting various costumes compiled and illustrated by Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist Lucas de Heere.  It is believed both paintings depict marriage celebrations.  The location of the ''F\u00eate'' is the river bank of the Thames while the ''Festival'' is placed in an imaginary landscape.  In both paintings, a procession is moving from right to left headed by two men carrying large oval cakes, two violinists and a man bearing a vase with rosemary tied with ribbons.  The faces of the figures are rendered with precision and are likely portraits of members of the Flemish community in England. The paintings may have been intended to showcase the dignity and piety of the Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 community in England and to assert their proper place in their adopted country.  It is believed that the man looking at the viewer appearing in both paintings is a self-portrait of the artist Gheeraerts.<ref name=dek>Remy Debes, ''Dignity: A History'', Oxford University Press, 2017, pp. 179\u2013180</ref>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The unfortunate painter and his family.jpg|thumb|300px|''The unfortunate painter and his family'']]\n\n[[Karel van Mander]] wrote in his ''Schilderboeck'' from 1604 that Gheeraerts was a good [[landscape painter]], who \"often had the habit of including a [[Squatting position|squatting]], urinating woman on a bridge or elsewhere.\"<ref name=Mander /> A similar detail is seen in one of his fable illustrations and his map of Bruges.  No landscape paintings by Gheeraerts' hand are currently attributed to him but some of his works such as the ''F\u00eate'', the ''Festival'' and the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] contain important landscape elements.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThe description of the art collection of Cornelis van Hooghendorp made at the end of the 16th century included five paintings by Gheeraerts. These included a landscape with cows, an allegorical representation with a \"scene of the night when the devil sowed bad seed\", a representation of ''Mary on the flight to Egypt'' and two paintings on parchment. In 1563 Marcus Gheeraerts also painted a triptych for the church of the friars minor recollect in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThe painting style of Gheeraerts was initially influenced by Bernard van Orley. After 1565 he followed the Italianate style of painting of prominent Antwerp history painter [[Maerten de Vos]]. His painting style is further close to that of the little-known [[Vincent Sellaer]].<ref name=ham/>\n\n===Prints===\nGheeraerts was active as a printmaker and print designer during his time in Flanders and in England. The best-known print works he created before he left for England are the map of Bruges, the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' (both discussed above) and the [[Emblem book|emblematic]] [[fable]] book ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'' (''The true fables of the animals'').<ref name=thyb/><ref name=Mander>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0238.htm Marcus Geerarts biography] in ''Schilder-boeck'' (1604) by [[Karel van Mander]]</ref>\n\n====De warachtighe fabulen der dieren====\n[[File:Gheeraerts satyr.jpg|thumb|260px|''The satyr and the peasant'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'']]\n\nThis book was published in 1567 in Bruges by Pieter de Clerck. Marcus Gheeraerts etched the title page and the 107 illustrations for each fable that his friend, Edewaerd de Dene, had written in his local [[Dutch language|Flemish]] verse. Gheeraerts initiated and financed the publication, which was printed to the highest standards of its time as a luxurious object with three different fonts.  Each fable takes up two facing pages: on the left-hand side the illustration is displayed headed with a proverb or saying and some verse underneath it while on the right-hand the fable and its moral are told. It was the first emblematic [[fable]] book and set a trend for similar books.\n\nThe principal source of the text in the book were ''Les fables du tr\u00e8s ancien \u00c9sope'' written by the French humanist Gilles Corrozet and published in Paris in 1542.  A second source was the ''Aesopi Phrygis et aliorum fabulae'', a collection of fables in Latin that was published on the Antwerp printing presses of [[Christophe Plantin]] in various editions from 1660. A third source for the fables writings of natural history such as ''Der Naturen Bloeme'' (The Flower (i.e. choice) of Nature), a Middle Dutch natural history encyclopedia, written in the thirteenth century by the Flemish writer [[Jacob van Maerlant]] and the Dutch-language natural history compilation ''Der Dieren Palleys'' (The palace of the Animals), published in Antwerp in 1520.  A final source for the fables are contemporary emblemata books such as the ''Emblemata'' of [[Andrea Alciato]] and an emblem of [[J\u00e1nos Zs\u00e1mboky|Joannes Sambucus]].<ref name=source>D.

After the death of his stepfather Simon Pieters in early 1557, Marcus Gheeraerts became the guardian of his half-brothers and sisters. Marcus's mother died on 8 August 1580.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The lamentation of Christ.jpeg|thumb|260px|''The lamentation of Christ'']]\n\nThe master or masters of Marcus Gheeraerts are not known. The most obvious candidate is his stepfather Simon Pieters. Art historians believe that he started his training with Simon Pieters and later worked in the workshop of his guardian [[Albert Cornelis]]. It is speculated that he may have had other masters but there is no agreement as to their identity.  He likely trained outside Bruges to learn the craft of engraver which was not generally practised at a high level in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThere is no information about Gheeraerts in the registers of the Sint-Lucas guild in Bruges for the period from 1522 to 1549.  This absence has been interpreted as an indication that he left his hometown to study in Antwerp or abroad. From 1558 onwards a number of documents demonstrate that Gheeraerts was resident in Bruges. On 31 July 1558, he entered the artisan and saddle maker's guild of Bruges as a master painter. In the same year, he was elected second board member of the guild, suggesting that he already enjoyed considerable professional recognition. From April to September 1561 Gheeraerts was the first board member.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nOn 3 June 1558, Marcus Gheeraerts married Johanna Struve. The couple had three children of whom two are known by name, a son later referred to as Marcus the Younger and a daughter called Esther. A third child died at a young age and was buried in 1561.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nGheeraerts developed a professional career as a painter, etcher and designer. He was active as a designer of heraldic motifs. On 10 September 1559, he was commissioned to provide designs for the tombs of [[Mary of Burgundy]] and [[Charles the Bold]] in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges. He drew the patterns for the lavishly decorated metal ornaments, the colorful coats of arms and two copper angels that were attached to the sides of the tombs.  In 1561 Marcus Gheeraerts was commissioned to complete a triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter [[Bernard van Orley]]. The painting had remained unfinished after van Orley's death in 1542. Originally intended for the church of the monastery of Brou near Bourg-en-Bresse (Ain department, France), which Margaret of Austria had built, the triptych was transferred to Bruges after her death. Gheeraerts completed it.  [[Margaret of Parma]] later decided to place the triptych in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[Image:Marcus Gheeraerts I (Attr) - Composite rotting head of a monk representing an allegory of iconoclasm.jpg|left|thumb|230px|''Allegory of Iconoclasm''<ref>Although not particularly sympathetic to the Calvinist iconoclasts, it is mainly critical of the Catholic Church. The etching may have been the main reason why Gheeraerts had to flee to England in 1568. (British Museum, Dept. of Print and Drawings, 1933.1.1..3, see also Edward Hodnett: ''Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder'', Utrecht 1971, pp. 26-7)</ref>]]\n\nGheeraerts was further commissioned in 1561 to make a print depicting a map of his hometown. He completed the work in one year. The map is one of the earliest examples of a perspective city map that is correctly displayed.<ref name=thyb/>  It is during this period that Gheeraerts most likely painted the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] (collection of the Memling museum in Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges).<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts became involved in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] community in Bruges and became a leader of the local church community.  Whereas Calvinism was initially tolerated the religious persecution of [[Calvinist]]s commenced in 1567 with the arrival of new governor of the Low Countries, the [[Duke of Alva]].  In 1566 he participated in protests against the arrest of Calvinists in Bruges. He reflected in his art on the religious turmoil and [[iconoclasm]] of his time.  As a Calvinist and artist he seemed to have had mixed feelings about the Iconoclasm of his religious group: he condemned idolatry of images but did not agree with the wholesale destruction of religious images by the Iconoclasts.  In 1566 or shortly after, he created a print referred to as the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' that shows a composite rotting head of a monk.  The head appears to rise up from a rocky outcropping. Myriad little figures swarm over the rocks. They enact 22 different scenes that used to be denoted by alphabetical keys which have not survived.<ref name=duke>Alastair Duke: Chapter ''Calvinists and 'papist idolatry': the mentality of the image-breakers in 1566'' in ''Dissident Identities in the Early Modern Low Countries'', Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2009, pp 196-197</ref>  Inside the gaping mouth a diabolical mass is celebrated. On the p\u00e2t\u00e9 of the head sits a pope-like figure under a canopy on a throne surrounded by bishops and monks.

His wife and daughter remained in Bruges. The verdict in his case was pronounced at the end of 1568.  He was convicted and the punishment was permanent banishment and forfeiture of his entire fortune.\n\nGheeraerts took up residence in London upon his arrival in England in 1568. He was joined by his daughter in May 1571 likely after her mother had died.  After the death of his wife in Bruges, the artist married in England his second wife, Sussanah de Critz.  His wife was a sister of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I's]] [[serjeant-painter]], [[John de Critz]], another Flemish painter who had fled to England.The couple had two daughters and one son.  The only child surviving into adulthood, Sarah, later married the famous French-born English [[limner]] [[Isaac Oliver]].  Just as before in Bruges, Gheeraerts made drawings and etchings and continued his painting activities.  As there was a keen demand for portrait paintings in England, Gheeraerts started to paint portraits, which he had not done while still in Flanders.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nArt historians do not agree as to whether Gheeraerts returned to his native Flanders around 1577 to continue his career in [[Antwerp]].  In 1577 a 'Mercus Geeraert Painter' was registered as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp and paid registration fees for the years 1585 and 1586.  It is not clear whether this Mercus referred to Marcus the Elder or to Marcus the Younger. Some art historians believe that Marcus the Elder registered in the Antwerp Guild in order to be able to legally work with Antwerp printers for the publications on which he worked.  Others believe that he actually worked in Antwerp and point to the various publications printed in Antwerp on which he collaborated.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts had various pupils during his career. In 1563, 13-year-old Melchior d'Assoneville became an apprentice of Gheeraerts in Bruges. Melchior d\u2019Assoneville later became a sculptor and decorative painter and while living in [[Mechelen]] he was the master of Hendrik Faydherbe. His workshop assistant Philipus de la Valla who fled with him to England may also have been a pupil of Gheeraerts although he is sometimes referraed to in contemporary records as a servant.  It is not certain whether Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder was the teacher of his son Marcus the Younger. There are different views on this, but it is likely that he was but that his son also received training with other artists who may have included other Flemish emigrants in England, such as [[Lucas de Heere]] and [[John de Critz]].\n \nThe date of death of Gheeraerts is not known but it must have been before 1599.<ref name=thyb/>\n\n==Work==\n===General===\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Procession of the Knights of the Garter (6).jpeg|thumb|330px|''Procession of the Knights of the Garter'']]\nGheeraerts was a painter, draughtsman, print designer, etcher and ornamemtal designer.  As many of his paintings were lost as a result of the Iconoclasm of the 16th century, he is now mainly known for his work as a printmaker and print designer. He was a keen innovator and experimented with [[etching]] at a time when [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] were dominant techniques. For example, his 1562 birds-eye view of the town of [[Bruges]] was etched on 10 different plates, and the resulting map measures 100 x 177&nbsp;cm.<ref name=map>[https://www.verrijkjekijkopbrugge.be/2017/12/08/de-koperplaten-van-de-kaart-van-marcus-gerards De koperplaten van de kaart van Marcus Gerards], 8 December 2017 {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n===Paintings===\nVery few paintings have been attributed to Gheeraerts with much certainty. He did not sign any of his paintings.  It is documented that he finished the triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter Bernard van Orley. The triptych was later damaged during the period of Iconoclasm and largely repainted in 1589 by [[Frans Pourbus the Younger]] during restoration work. It is not clear from the current state of the work, which parts were painted by which painter. It has been suggested that Bernard van Orley started the centre of the panel and that Marcus Gheeraerts completed the outer areas. A replica of the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The lamentation of Christ.jpeg|scene of ''The lamentation of Christ'']] appeared on the art market (Hampel Fine Art sale of 27 June 2019, lot 551) and was attributed to Gheeraerts.  Another version of the Lamentation also attributed to Gheeraerts is in the Saint Amands Church of [[Geel]].<ref name=ham>[https://www.hampel-auctions.com/o/online-catalogue-detail.html?la=en&a=119&s=656&id=1140&acl=1190541 Marcus Gheeraerts I, ''The lamentation of Christ''] at Hampel Fine Art auctions</ref> \n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Map of Bruges - Peeing woman.jpg|thumb|270px|left|''Urinating woman'' from the map of Bruges]]\n\nThe panel of the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] (Memling museum in Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges) has been attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts.

The traditional attribution to Gheeraerts of the [[:File:Elizabeth I of England Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder.jpg|''Portrait of Elizabeth I of England'']], also referred to as the ''Peace portrait'' is still a matter of contention. The monogram \u201cM.G.F.\u201d on the portrait can apply to both Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder and his son Marcus the Younger. Some art historians regard it as a collaboration of father and son Gheeraerts. A [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Portrait of Prince William I of Orange.JPG|''Portrait of Prince William I of Orange'']] ([[Blair Castle]], Scotland) has also been attributed to Gheeraerts.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nTwo works depicting celebrations, the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - Festival at Bermondsey c. 1569.jpg|''F\u00eate at Bermondsey'']] and [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - A Village Festival.jpg|''A village festival'']] ([[Hatfield House]], Herefordshire), England), formerly attributed to Flemish artist [[Joris Hoefnagel]], were attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder in 2015.<ref>Edward Town, ''\"A f\u00eate at Bermondsey\" an English landscape by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder'', The Burlington magazine 157.2015,1346, 309-317</ref>  An inscription on the first painting indicates it was painted on commission by the Flemish merchant Jacob Hoefnagel, a brother of Joris Hoefnagel and a resident of London.  The inscription also mentions that Jacob Hoefnagel wanted the picture to depict all the fashions that could be seen in England.  Gheeraerts followed this instruction by depicting the figures in costumes from England, France, Venice and other European countries.  These costumes were based on a publication depicting various costumes compiled and illustrated by Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist Lucas de Heere.  It is believed both paintings depict marriage celebrations.  The location of the ''F\u00eate'' is the river bank of the Thames while the ''Festival'' is placed in an imaginary landscape.  In both paintings, a procession is moving from right to left headed by two men carrying large oval cakes, two violinists and a man bearing a vase with rosemary tied with ribbons.  The faces of the figures are rendered with precision and are likely portraits of members of the Flemish community in England. The paintings may have been intended to showcase the dignity and piety of the Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 community in England and to assert their proper place in their adopted country.  It is believed that the man looking at the viewer appearing in both paintings is a self-portrait of the artist Gheeraerts.<ref name=dek>Remy Debes, ''Dignity: A History'', Oxford University Press, 2017, pp. 179\u2013180</ref>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The unfortunate painter and his family.jpg|thumb|300px|''The unfortunate painter and his family'']]\n\n[[Karel van Mander]] wrote in his ''Schilderboeck'' from 1604 that Gheeraerts was a good [[landscape painter]], who \"often had the habit of including a [[Squatting position|squatting]], urinating woman on a bridge or elsewhere.\"<ref name=Mander /> A similar detail is seen in one of his fable illustrations and his map of Bruges.  No landscape paintings by Gheeraerts' hand are currently attributed to him but some of his works such as the ''F\u00eate'', the ''Festival'' and the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] contain important landscape elements.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThe description of the art collection of Cornelis van Hooghendorp made at the end of the 16th century included five paintings by Gheeraerts. These included a landscape with cows, an allegorical representation with a \"scene of the night when the devil sowed bad seed\", a representation of ''Mary on the flight to Egypt'' and two paintings on parchment. In 1563 Marcus Gheeraerts also painted a triptych for the church of the friars minor recollect in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThe painting style of Gheeraerts was initially influenced by Bernard van Orley. After 1565 he followed the Italianate style of painting of prominent Antwerp history painter [[Maerten de Vos]]. His painting style is further close to that of the little-known [[Vincent Sellaer]].<ref name=ham/>\n\n===Prints===\nGheeraerts was active as a printmaker and print designer during his time in Flanders and in England. The best-known print works he created before he left for England are the map of Bruges, the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' (both discussed above) and the [[Emblem book|emblematic]] [[fable]] book ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'' (''The true fables of the animals'').<ref name=thyb/><ref name=Mander>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0238.htm Marcus Geerarts biography] in ''Schilder-boeck'' (1604) by [[Karel van Mander]]</ref>\n\n====De warachtighe fabulen der dieren====\n[[File:Gheeraerts satyr.jpg|thumb|260px|''The satyr and the peasant'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'']]\n\nThis book was published in 1567 in Bruges by Pieter de Clerck. Marcus Gheeraerts etched the title page and the 107 illustrations for each fable that his friend, Edewaerd de Dene, had written in his local [[Dutch language|Flemish]] verse. Gheeraerts initiated and financed the publication, which was printed to the highest standards of its time as a luxurious object with three different fonts.  Each fable takes up two facing pages: on the left-hand side the illustration is displayed headed with a proverb or saying and some verse underneath it while on the right-hand the fable and its moral are told. It was the first emblematic [[fable]] book and set a trend for similar books.\n\nThe principal source of the text in the book were ''Les fables du tr\u00e8s ancien \u00c9sope'' written by the French humanist Gilles Corrozet and published in Paris in 1542.  A second source was the ''Aesopi Phrygis et aliorum fabulae'', a collection of fables in Latin that was published on the Antwerp printing presses of [[Christophe Plantin]] in various editions from 1660. A third source for the fables writings of natural history such as ''Der Naturen Bloeme'' (The Flower (i.e. choice) of Nature), a Middle Dutch natural history encyclopedia, written in the thirteenth century by the Flemish writer [[Jacob van Maerlant]] and the Dutch-language natural history compilation ''Der Dieren Palleys'' (The palace of the Animals), published in Antwerp in 1520.  A final source for the fables are contemporary emblemata books such as the ''Emblemata'' of [[Andrea Alciato]] and an emblem of [[J\u00e1nos Zs\u00e1mboky|Joannes Sambucus]].<ref name=source>D.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

In a scene from Luxor, Nefertari appears leading the royal children. Another scene shows Nefertari at the Festival of the Mast of [[Amun]]-[[Min (god)|Min]]-Kamephis. The king and the queen are said to worship in the new temple and are shown overseeing the Erection of the Mast before Amen-Re attended by standard bearers. Nefertari\u2019s speech during this ceremony is recorded: \n: <blockquote>'' \"Your beloved son, the Lord of Both Lands, Usermaatre Setepenre, has come to see you in your beautiful manifestation. He has erected for you the mast of the (pavilion)-framework. May you grant him eternity as King, and victory over those rebellious (against) His Majesty, L.P.H.\"\u2019\u2019 <ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/> </blockquote>\n\nNefertari appears as Ramesses II\u2019s consort on many statues in both Luxor and Karnak. In Western Thebes, Nefertari is mentioned on a statuary group from Deir el-BAhari, a stela and blocks from Deir el-Medina.<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\nThe greatest honor was bestowed on Nefertari however in [[Abu Simbel]]. Nefertari is depicted in statue form at the [[Abu Simbel temples|great temple]], but the [[Abu Simbel temples#The Small Temple|small temple]] is dedicated to Nefertari and the goddess [[Hathor]]. The building project was started earlier in the reign of [[Ramesses II]], and seems to have been inaugurated by ca year 25 of his reign (but not completed until ten years later).<ref name=\"Kitchen-PT\"/>\n\nNefertari\u2019s prominence at court is further supported by [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets from the [[Hittites|Hittite]] city of [[Hattusas]] (today [[Boghazkoy]], [[Turkey]]), containing Nefertari's correspondence with the king [[Hattusili III]] and his wife [[Puduhepa]]. She is mentioned in the letters as ''Naptera.''  Nefertari is known to have sent gifts to Puduhepa:\n: <blockquote>The great Queen Naptera of the land of Egypt speaks thus: Speak to my sister Puduhepa, the Great Queen of the Hatti land. I, your sister, (also) be well!! May your country be well. Now, I have learned that you, my sister, have written to me asking after my health. ...

Her daughter [[Meritamen]] is depicted taking part in place of her mother in some of the scenes. Nefertari may well have been in failing health at this point. After her death she was buried in tomb [[QV66]] in the [[Valley of the Queens]].<ref name=\"Kitchen-PT\"/><ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\n== Monuments==\n\n===Abu Simbel, great temple===\n{{main| Abu Simbel temples }}\n[[File:Abu-Simbel temple2.jpg|thumb|100px|Nefertari beside a colossus of [[Ramesses&nbsp;II]]]]\nNefertari appears twice as one of the royal women represented beside the colossal statues of [[Ramesses&nbsp;II]] that stand before the temple. To the left of the doorway, Nefertari, Queen-Mother [[Tuya (queen)|Tuya]] and the king's son [[Amun-her-khepeshef]] (still called Amunhirwenemef here) flank the colossal statue of the king.

They stand before the barque of [[Amun]], and Nefertari is shown playing the sistra. Elsewhere Nefertari and Ramesses&nbsp;II are shown before a barque dedicated to a deified Ramesses&nbsp;II. Nefertari is shown twice accompanying her husband in Triumph scenes.<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\n===Abu Simbel, small temple===\n[[Image:S F-E-CAMERON EGYPT 2005 APR 00354.JPG|thumb|left|130px|right|Temple of Nefertari at Abu Simbel]]\n\nThe small temple at Abu Simbel was dedicated to Nefertari and [[Hathor]] of Ibshek. The dedication text on one of the buttresses states :\n: \u2018\u2019 A temple of great and Mighty monuments, for the Great Royal Wife Nefertari Meryetmut, for whose sake the (very) sun does shine, given life and beloved;\u2019\u2019 (Kitchen) <ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\nWhile on other buttresses it says:\n: \u2018\u2019 King of South and North Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre; - he has made a Temple by excavation in the mountain, of eternal work(manship) in Nubia, which the King of South and North Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre has made for the Great Royal Wife Nefertari Meryetmut, in Nubia, like Re forever and ever.\u2019\u2019 (Kitchen) <ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\nThe two colossal standing statues of Nefertari in front of the small temple are equal in size to those of Ramesses&nbsp;II.

She wears a long sheet dress and she is depicted with a long wig, Hathoric cow horns, the solar disk, and tall feathers mounted on a [[modius (headdress)|modius]].<ref name=\"TyldesleyQueens\"/>\n\nIn the interior of the temple, Nefertari appears in a variety of scenes. She is shown for instance offering to a cow (Hathor) in a papyrus thicket, offering before [[Khnum]], [[Satet|Satis]], and [[Anuket]], the triad of [[Elephantine]], and offering to [[Mut]] and [[Hathor]].<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\n=== Tomb 66 in the Valley of the Queens===\n{{main|Valley of the Queens| QV66 }}\n [[Image:Ankh isis nefertari.jpg|thumb|right|The goddess [[Hathor]] giving an [[ankh]], representing \"life\", to Nefertari]]\n\nThe tomb of Nefertari, [[QV66]] is one of the largest in the [[Valley of the Queens]]. It is 520 square meters, and covered with pictures of Nefertari. Her husband the pharaoh is not represented in any of the pictures. Nefertari can be seen wearing Greek silver earrings with a labrys design in one of the portraits (see lead image). These would have been sent to her as a gift for diplomatic reasons. The tomb was robbed in antiquity. In 1904 it was rediscovered and excavated by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]].<ref name=\"TyldesleyQueens\"/> Several items from the tomb, including parts of gold bracelets, shabti figures and a small piece of an earring or pendant are now in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].

Ramesses also constructed a temple for her at [[Abu Simbel]] next to his colossal monument there.<!-- {{Hiero | Nefertari | <hiero>t*G15-nfr-i-t:r:Z1*Z1-n:N36:t</hiero> | align=left| era=default}} already above-->\n\n== Titles ==\n[[File:Pilgrim bottle.

There is no conclusive evidence linking Nefertari to the royal family of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], however.<ref name=\"TyldesleyQueens\">Tyldesley, Joyce.

[[Amun-her-khepeshef]], the eldest was Crown Prince and Commander of the Troops, and [[Pareherwenemef]] would later serve in Ramesses II\u2019s army. Prince [[Meryatum]] was elevated to the position of [[High Priest of Re]] in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. Inscriptions mention he was a son of Nefertari. Prince Meryre is a fourth son mentioned on the fa\u00e7ade of the small temple at [[Abu Simbel]] and is thought to be another son of Nefertari.

In a scene from Luxor, Nefertari appears leading the royal children. Another scene shows Nefertari at the Festival of the Mast of [[Amun]]-[[Min (god)|Min]]-Kamephis. The king and the queen are said to worship in the new temple and are shown overseeing the Erection of the Mast before Amen-Re attended by standard bearers. Nefertari\u2019s speech during this ceremony is recorded: \n: <blockquote>'' \"Your beloved son, the Lord of Both Lands, Usermaatre Setepenre, has come to see you in your beautiful manifestation. He has erected for you the mast of the (pavilion)-framework. May you grant him eternity as King, and victory over those rebellious (against) His Majesty, L.P.H.\"\u2019\u2019 <ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/> </blockquote>\n\nNefertari appears as Ramesses II\u2019s consort on many statues in both Luxor and Karnak. In Western Thebes, Nefertari is mentioned on a statuary group from Deir el-BAhari, a stela and blocks from Deir el-Medina.<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\nThe greatest honor was bestowed on Nefertari however in [[Abu Simbel]]. Nefertari is depicted in statue form at the [[Abu Simbel temples|great temple]], but the [[Abu Simbel temples#The Small Temple|small temple]] is dedicated to Nefertari and the goddess [[Hathor]]. The building project was started earlier in the reign of [[Ramesses II]], and seems to have been inaugurated by ca year 25 of his reign (but not completed until ten years later).<ref name=\"Kitchen-PT\"/>\n\nNefertari\u2019s prominence at court is further supported by [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets from the [[Hittites|Hittite]] city of [[Hattusas]] (today [[Boghazkoy]], [[Turkey]]), containing Nefertari's correspondence with the king [[Hattusili III]] and his wife [[Puduhepa]]. She is mentioned in the letters as ''Naptera.''  Nefertari is known to have sent gifts to Puduhepa:\n: <blockquote>The great Queen Naptera of the land of Egypt speaks thus: Speak to my sister Puduhepa, the Great Queen of the Hatti land. I, your sister, (also) be well!! May your country be well. Now, I have learned that you, my sister, have written to me asking after my health. ... You have written to me because of the good friendship and brotherly relationship between your brother, the king of Egypt, The Great and the Storm god will bring about peace, and he will make the brotherly relationship between the Egptian king, the Great King, and his brother, the Hatti King, the Great King, last for ever...

Her daughter [[Meritamen]] is depicted taking part in place of her mother in some of the scenes. Nefertari may well have been in failing health at this point. After her death she was buried in tomb [[QV66]] in the [[Valley of the Queens]].<ref name=\"Kitchen-PT\"/><ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\n== Monuments==\n\n===Abu Simbel, great temple===\n{{main| Abu Simbel temples }}\n[[File:Abu-Simbel temple2.jpg|thumb|100px|Nefertari beside a colossus of [[Ramesses&nbsp;II]]]]\nNefertari appears twice as one of the royal women represented beside the colossal statues of [[Ramesses&nbsp;II]] that stand before the temple. To the left of the doorway, Nefertari, Queen-Mother [[Tuya (queen)|Tuya]] and the king's son [[Amun-her-khepeshef]] (still called Amunhirwenemef here) flank the colossal statue of the king. To the right of the doorway Nefertari, Baketmut and the king's son [[Ramesses (prince)|Ramesses]] are shown with the [[Pharaoh]].<ref name=\"TyldesleyQueens\"/>\n\nInside the temple Nefertari is depicted on one of the pillars in the great pillared hall worshipping [[Hathor]] of Ibshek.<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\nOn the wall of the inner pillared hall Nefertari appears behind Ramesses&nbsp;II. They stand before the barque of [[Amun]], and Nefertari is shown playing the sistra. Elsewhere Nefertari and Ramesses&nbsp;II are shown before a barque dedicated to a deified Ramesses&nbsp;II. Nefertari is shown twice accompanying her husband in Triumph scenes.<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\n===Abu Simbel, small temple===\n[[Image:S F-E-CAMERON EGYPT 2005 APR 00354.JPG|thumb|left|130px|right|Temple of Nefertari at Abu Simbel]]\n\nThe small temple at Abu Simbel was dedicated to Nefertari and [[Hathor]] of Ibshek. The dedication text on one of the buttresses states :\n: \u2018\u2019 A temple of great and Mighty monuments, for the Great Royal Wife Nefertari Meryetmut, for whose sake the (very) sun does shine, given life and beloved;\u2019\u2019 (Kitchen) <ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\nWhile on other buttresses it says:\n: \u2018\u2019 King of South and North Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre; - he has made a Temple by excavation in the mountain, of eternal work(manship) in Nubia, which the King of South and North Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre has made for the Great Royal Wife Nefertari Meryetmut, in Nubia, like Re forever and ever.\u2019\u2019 (Kitchen) <ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\nThe two colossal standing statues of Nefertari in front of the small temple are equal in size to those of Ramesses&nbsp;II. Nefertari is shown holding a sistrum. She wears a long sheet dress and she is depicted with a long wig, Hathoric cow horns, the solar disk, and tall feathers mounted on a [[modius (headdress)|modius]].<ref name=\"TyldesleyQueens\"/>\n\nIn the interior of the temple, Nefertari appears in a variety of scenes. She is shown for instance offering to a cow (Hathor) in a papyrus thicket, offering before [[Khnum]], [[Satet|Satis]], and [[Anuket]], the triad of [[Elephantine]], and offering to [[Mut]] and [[Hathor]].<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\n=== Tomb 66 in the Valley of the Queens===\n{{main|Valley of the Queens| QV66 }}\n [[Image:Ankh isis nefertari.jpg|thumb|right|The goddess [[Hathor]] giving an [[ankh]], representing \"life\", to Nefertari]]\n\nThe tomb of Nefertari, [[QV66]] is one of the largest in the [[Valley of the Queens]]. It is 520 square meters, and covered with pictures of Nefertari. Her husband the pharaoh is not represented in any of the pictures. Nefertari can be seen wearing Greek silver earrings with a labrys design in one of the portraits (see lead image). These would have been sent to her as a gift for diplomatic reasons. The tomb was robbed in antiquity. In 1904 it was rediscovered and excavated by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]].<ref name=\"TyldesleyQueens\"/> Several items from the tomb, including parts of gold bracelets, shabti figures and a small piece of an earring or pendant are now in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].  Additional shabti figures are in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.<ref name=\"KitchenRI-2\"/>\n\nIt was reported that a pair of mummified legs found in QV66 and now at the [[Museo Egizio]] of [[Turin]] may indeed be Nefertari's based on the bone structure and the age of the person, which fits the profile of Nefertari.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166571|title=Queen Nefertari, the Royal Spouse of Pharaoh Ramses II: A Multidisciplinary Investigation of the Mummified Remains Found in Her Tomb (QV66)|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=11|pages=e0166571|publisher=PLOS ONE|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=February 15, 2017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0166571|pmid=27902731|last1=Habicht|first1=Michael E.|last2=Bianucci|first2=Raffaella|last3=Buckley|first3=Stephen A.|last4=Fletcher|first4=Joann|last5=Bouwman|first5=Abigail S.|last6=\u00d6hrstr\u00f6m|first6=Lena M.|last7=Seiler|first7=Roger|last8=Galassi|first8=Francesco M.|last9=Hajdas|first9=Irka|last10=Vassilika|first10=Eleni|last11=B\u00f6ni|first11=Thomas|last12=Henneberg|first12=Maciej|last13=R\u00fchli|first13=Frank J.|pmc=5130223}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Nefertari}}\n* [https://www.egypttoursportal.com/queen-nefertari/ Queen Nefertari]\n* [http://www.osirisnet.net/tombes/pharaons/nefertari/e_nefertari_01.htm The tomb of Nefertari Merytmut]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:13th-century BC births]]\n[[Category:1250s BC deaths]]\n[[Category:13th-century BC Egyptian people]]\n[[Category:13th-century BC Egyptian women]]\n[[Category:13th-century BC clergy]]\n[[Category:Queens consort of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]\n[[Category:Ramesses II]]\n[[Category:Nefertari| ]]\n", "name_user": "2601:5c2:8401:9370:6c16:8338:515:dd7c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertari"}
