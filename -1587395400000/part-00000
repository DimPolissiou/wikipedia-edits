The lawsuit began a five-year battle, which cost millions of dollars, and according to an article in ''The New York Times'', left Holm and her husband with a \"fragile hold\" on their apartment, which Holm purchased for $10,000 cash in 1953 from her film earnings, and which in 2011 was believed to be worth at least $10,000,000.<ref name=\"holmandbasile\"/>\n\n==Health and death==\nAccording to Basile, Holm had been treated for memory loss since 2002, suffered skin cancer, bleeding ulcers and a collapsed lung, and had hip replacements and pacemakers.<ref name=holmandbasile/>\n\nIn June 2012, Holm was admitted to New York's [[Roosevelt Hospital]] with dehydration, where she suffered a heart attack on July 13, 2012; she died two days later at her Central Park West apartment, aged 95.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first=Anita |last=Gates |title=Celeste Holm, Witty Character Actress, Is Dead at 95 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/theater/celeste-holm-witty-character-actress-dies-at-95.html |quote=Celeste Holm, the New York-born actress who made an indelible Broadway impression as an amorous country girl in Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\", earned an Academy Award as the knowing voice of tolerance in \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and went on to a six-decade screen and stage career, frequently cast as the wistful or brittle sophisticate, died early Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan.

She originated the role of Ado Annie in the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943).<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn and raised in Manhattan, Holm was an only child. Her mother, Jean Parke, was an American portrait artist and author. Her father, Theodor Holm, was a Norwegian businessman whose company provided marine adjustment services for [[Lloyd's of London]].<ref name=today/> Because of her parents' occupations, she traveled often during her youth and attended various schools in the Netherlands, France and the United States. She began high school at the [[University School for Girls]] in Chicago, and then transferred to the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)]] where she performed in many school stage productions and graduated as a member of the class of 1935. She then studied drama at the [[University of Chicago]] before becoming a stage actress in the late 1930s.<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Studio publicity Celeste Holm.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo, c. 1940]]\nHolm's first professional theatrical role was in a production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' starring [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]. She first appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in a small part in ''Gloriana'' (1938), a comedy which lasted for only five performances, but her first major part on Broadway was in [[William Saroyan]]'s revival of ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' (1940) as Mary L. with fellow newcomer [[Gene Kelly]]. The role that got her the most recognition from critics and audiences was as Ado Annie in the premiere production of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' in 1943.\n\nAfter she starred in the Broadway production of ''[[Bloomer Girl]]'', [[20th Century Fox]] signed Holm to a movie contract in 1946.

The lawsuit began a five-year battle, which cost millions of dollars, and according to an article in ''The New York Times'', left Holm and her husband with a \"fragile hold\" on their apartment, which Holm purchased for $10,000 cash in 1953 from her film earnings, and which in 2011 was believed to be worth at least $10,000,000.<ref name=\"holmandbasile\"/>\n\n==Health and death==\nAccording to Basile, Holm had been treated for memory loss since 2002, suffered skin cancer, bleeding ulcers and a collapsed lung, and had hip replacements and pacemakers.<ref name=holmandbasile/>\n\nIn June 2012, Holm was admitted to New York's [[Roosevelt Hospital]] with dehydration, where she suffered a heart attack on July 13, 2012; she died two days later at her Central Park West apartment, aged 95.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |first=Anita |last=Gates |title=Celeste Holm, Witty Character Actress, Is Dead at 95 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/theater/celeste-holm-witty-character-actress-dies-at-95.html |quote=Celeste Holm, the New York-born actress who made an indelible Broadway impression as an amorous country girl in Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\", earned an Academy Award as the knowing voice of tolerance in \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and went on to a six-decade screen and stage career, frequently cast as the wistful or brittle sophisticate, died early Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan.

Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, \"I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world', was to be trusted.

Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in [[North (poetry collection)|''North'']] (1975), featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into \"the laureate of violence\u2014a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Donoghue|first1=Bernard|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=4}}</ref> Poems such as \"Bogland\" and \"Bog Queen\" addressed political struggles directly for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0LZlAAAAMAAJ |p=5 |title=The body and desire in contemporary Irish poetry |author=Irene Gilsenan Nordin |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2006|isbn=9780716533689 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nAllusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trinity.duke.edu/node/1637 |work=[[Duke University]] |author=Ezgi Ustundag |title=Expressing Humanity During 'The Troubles:' The Poetry of Seamus Heaney}}</ref> His books ''Wintering Out'' (1973) and ''North'' (1975) seek to interweave commentary on [[the Troubles]] with a historical context and wider human experience.<ref name=poetry_foundation>{{cite news|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/seamus-heaney|title=Biography|work=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> While some critics accused Heaney of being \"an apologist and a mythologiser\" of the violence, [[Blake Morrison]] suggests the poet <blockquote>has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance...

He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, \"To read 'Requiem for the Croppies' wasn't to say \u2018up the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]\u2019 or anything.

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.

Originally entitled ''The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People'' on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of ''The Rattle Bag'' was to offer enjoyment to the reader: \"Arbitrary riches.\" Heaney commented \"the book in our heads was something closer to ''The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement.''\"<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment/> It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, ''The School Bag'' aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted \"less of a carnival, more like a checklist.\" It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience.<ref name=bags_of_enlightenment>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/25/poetry.highereducation|title=Bags of enlightenment|date=25 October 2003|accessdate=25 October 2003|first=Seamus|last=Heaney|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref> <!--Two of his poems entitled \"Storm on the Island\" and \"Follower\" feature on the new [[GCSE]] English Literature course as part of the anthology poetry cluster.

Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\n<poem>\n:Don't be surprised if I demur, for, be advised\n:My passport's green.\n:No glass of ours was ever raised\n:To toast The Queen.<ref name=sameer_rahim_70th_birthday_interview/>\n</poem>\n\n===Translation===\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] influences in his work and study. Critic [[W. S. Di Piero]] noted <blockquote>Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom.<ref name=poetry_foundation/></blockquote> Heaney's first translation was of the Irish lyric poem ''[[Buile Shuibhne|Buile Suibhne]]'', published as ''Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish'' (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in ''Station Island'' (1984). Heaney's prize-winning translation of ''[[Beowulf: A New Verse Translation|Beowulf]]'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".<ref name=poetry_foundation/>\n\n===Plays and prose===\nHis plays include ''The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles' Philoctetes'' (1991). Heaney's 2004 play, ''[[The Burial at Thebes]],'' suggests parallels between [[Creon]] and the foreign policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/arts/21weekahead.html|title=The Week Ahead: Jan. 21 \u2013 27|first=Steven|last=McElroy|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nHeaney's engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works ''The Redress of Poetry'' (1995) and ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971\u20132001'' (2002).<ref name=poetry_foundation/> \n<blockquote>\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"<ref name=toibin_human_chain/></blockquote>He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\".<ref name=toibin_human_chain/> Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]].<ref>Kay, Magdalena.

He led a popular movement for the inclusion of Pahari as an [[official language of India]] in Schedule 8 of the [[Indian Constitution]], a demand currently under the consideration of the Government of India.\n\nParashar was an author in English, Hindi and Pahari, and was an authority on Parliamentary procedure, [[Buddhism]] and on [[sociopolitical]] problems of the hilly areas of the country. He also translated the Buddhist texts ''Dhampadda'', ''Bodhicharyavataara'', and ''Saddharmapundriksutra'' (the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'') into his native Pahari language. He was awarded a [[Doctorate]] by the University of Delhi for his critical analysis of the ''Bodhicharyavataara''.\n\nProfessor Parashar was a follower of the ideas of the Indian independence leader Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], and worked to spread his message. He founded a school in Bose's name in the village of Sera, Hamirpur, and celebrated his birthday every year. Parashar was also a Buddhist scholar, and celebrated [[Buddha Purnima]] every year.\n\nParashar worked to promote the legacy of Himachali leaders and freedom fighters.

Parashar served as the Chairman of the Committee on Government Assurances for four years (1986\u201389).\n\nParashar represented India several times in international fora, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] sessions in 1980 and in 1986 ([[New York City]]), the [[UNESCO]] Conference in 1985, and the international conclave to solve the [[Nicaragua]] problem, held in [[Lisbon]]. Parashar was awarded [[honorary citizenship]] of [[New Jersey]], USA in 1986.\n\nParashar was the only member of the [[Indian National Congress]] party to withstand the anti-Congress waves of 1977 and 1990. Subsequent to his landmark win in the 1990 assembly elections Sh. [[Rajiv Gandhi]] made Parashar president of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee, on 11 June 1990. He campaigned tirelessly for the revival of the party and it resulted in the return of the Congress party to power in the state. He won the [[Nadaun]] assembly seat again in 1993 and was the Education minister of the state until 1998. He used his position to get various centrally sponsored schemes sanctioned for Himachal, Sanskrit Vidyapeeth at Kaleshwar in Kangra, Kendriya Vidyalayas in Hamirpur and Nadaun. DPEP (District Primary Education Programme), ICDS schemes for various blocks of the state were introduced. In addition the state's achievements in the field of education, during his tenure, were acclaimed by Dr. Amratya Sen.

He led a popular movement for the inclusion of Pahari as an [[official language of India]] in Schedule 8 of the [[Indian Constitution]], a demand currently under the consideration of the Government of India.\n\nParashar was an author in English, Hindi and Pahari, and was an authority on Parliamentary procedure, [[Buddhism]] and on [[sociopolitical]] problems of the hilly areas of the country. He also translated the Buddhist texts ''Dhampadda'', ''Bodhicharyavataara'', and ''Saddharmapundriksutra'' (the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'') into his native Pahari language. He was awarded a [[Doctorate]] by the University of Delhi for his critical analysis of the ''Bodhicharyavataara''.\n\nProfessor Parashar was a follower of the ideas of the Indian independence leader Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], and worked to spread his message. He founded a school in Bose's name in the village of Sera, Hamirpur, and celebrated his birthday every year. Parashar was also a Buddhist scholar, and celebrated [[Buddha Purnima]] every year.\n\nParashar worked to promote the legacy of Himachali leaders and freedom fighters. He wrote the biography of [[Baba Kanshi Ram|Pahari Gandhi Baba Kanshi Ram]], poet and freedom fighter,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publicationsdivision.nic.in/Eng-Pub/Biographies/EB07.HTM |title=bio |accessdate=2007-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928215129/http://publicationsdivision.nic.in/Eng-Pub/Biographies/EB07.HTM |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was successful in getting a postage stamp released in his honour by the then Prime Minister of India, [[Indira Gandhi]], in 1983.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nNarain Chand Parashar was elected three times to the [[Lok Sabha]], or lower house of the [[Parliament of India]]; the [[5th Lok Sabha|5th]] (1971\u20131977), the [[7th Lok Sabha|7th]] (1980\u20131984), and the [[8th Lok Sabha]] (1984\u20131989).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/lsdeb/ls13/ses6/020301.html |title=fioe |accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> He received the \"Best Parliamentarian Award\" for the year 1987, the award being presented by the then Vice-President of India Dr. [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]]. Parashar served as the Chairman of the Committee on Government Assurances for four years (1986\u201389).\n\nParashar represented India several times in international fora, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] sessions in 1980 and in 1986 ([[New York City]]), the [[UNESCO]] Conference in 1985, and the international conclave to solve the [[Nicaragua]] problem, held in [[Lisbon]]. Parashar was awarded [[honorary citizenship]] of [[New Jersey]], USA in 1986.\n\nParashar was the only member of the [[Indian National Congress]] party to withstand the anti-Congress waves of 1977 and 1990. Subsequent to his landmark win in the 1990 assembly elections Sh. [[Rajiv Gandhi]] made Parashar president of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee, on 11 June 1990. He campaigned tirelessly for the revival of the party and it resulted in the return of the Congress party to power in the state. He won the [[Nadaun]] assembly seat again in 1993 and was the Education minister of the state until 1998. He used his position to get various centrally sponsored schemes sanctioned for Himachal, Sanskrit Vidyapeeth at Kaleshwar in Kangra, Kendriya Vidyalayas in Hamirpur and Nadaun. DPEP (District Primary Education Programme), ICDS schemes for various blocks of the state were introduced. In addition the state's achievements in the field of education, during his tenure, were acclaimed by Dr. Amratya Sen. Parashar died on 21 February 2001 in [[Delhi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/lsdeb/ls13/ses6/020301.html|title=Obituary References}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parashar, Narain Chand}}\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:People from Firozpur]]\n[[Category:Scholars from Himachal Pradesh]]\n[[Category:People from Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh]]\n[[Category:7th Lok Sabha members]]\n[[Category:8th Lok Sabha members]]\n[[Category:Lok Sabha members from Himachal Pradesh]]\n[[Category:20th-century Indian linguists]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toParliamentarian(link changed toMember of parliament) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narain_Chand_Parashar"}

These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.\n\nTacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').\n\n==Life==\nDetails about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].<ref>''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hell\u00e9nique'', 1890, pp. 621\u2013623</ref>\n\nTacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;<ref>Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy</ref> but the exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.<ref>See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.</ref> One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.<ref>Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichit\u00e0'', 2 (1972) 169\u2013185</ref>\n\n===Family and early life===\nMost of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 612\u2013613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nHis father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|NH]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother\u2014if Cornelius was indeed his father.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26</ref> The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.</ref> His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 614\u2013616</ref> No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 616\u2013619</ref> Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145</ref>\n\nHis ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]]. This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.<ref>Gordon, 1936, pp. 150\u2013151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621\u2013624</ref>\n\n===Public life, marriage, and literary career===\nAs a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]<ref>The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> ({{circa|35 AD}} \u2013 {{circa| 100}}).<!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---> In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.<ref>''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]</ref> Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.<ref>Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny1.html#6 1.6], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#10 9.10]; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541\u2013542</ref> He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26\u201327</ref> under [[Vespasian]]<ref>([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])</ref> (r. 69\u201379), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].<ref name=quaestor>He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.</ref> He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].<ref>In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88.

Even [[Nero]] turned his eyes away, and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered; with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen, to know that our sighs were being recorded...</blockquote>\n\nFrom his seat in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], he became [[suffect consul]] in 97 during the reign of [[Nerva]], being the [[novus homo|first of his family]] to do so.

See Dudley, 1968, p. 16</ref> Afterwards, he absented himself from public life, but returned during [[Trajan]]'s reign (98\u2013117). In 100, he and his friend Pliny the Younger prosecuted {{ill|Marius Priscus|la}} ([[proconsul]] of Africa) for corruption.

A passage in the ''Annals'' fixes 116 as the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' of his death, which may have been as late as 125 or even 130. It seems that he survived both Pliny (died {{circa|113}}) and Trajan (died 117).<ref>Grant in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Annals'', p. xvii; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germania'', p. 2. ''Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.61 2.61], says that the Roman Empire \"now extends to the [[Red Sea]]\". If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387\u2013393.</ref>\nIt remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (r. 275\u2013276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.<ref>''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X]. Scholarly opinion on this story is that it is either \"a confused and worthless rumor\" (Mendell, 1957, p. 4) or \"pure fiction\" (Syme, 1958, p. 796). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus\u2014but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of persons mentioned in the works of Tacitus}}\n[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of [[Justus Lipsius]]'s 1598 edition of the complete works of Tacitus, bearing the stamps of the ''Bibliotheca Comunale'' in [[Empoli]], Italy]]\n\nFive works ascribed to Tacitus have survived (albeit with lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:\n* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')\n* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')\n* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')\n* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')\n* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')\n\n===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===\nThe ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.<ref>[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', \"in thirty volumes\".</ref>\nAlthough Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the ''Annals'' survived in a single manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany, and the second half in a single manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.\n\n====The ''Histories''====\n{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}\nIn an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains\u2014as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]\u2014a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.\n\n====The ''Annals''====\n{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].\n[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]\n\n===Monographs===\nTacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.\n\n====''Germania''====\n{{Main|Germania (book)}}\n\nThe ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1\u201327) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10\u201313).\n\n====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====\n{{Main|Agricola (book)}}\nThe ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014Oxford Revised Translation).\n\n====''Dialogus''====\n{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]\nThere is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.\n\n==Literary style==\nTacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.\n\nIn most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.\n\n===Approach to history===\nTacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating\u2014often pessimistic\u2014insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:\n:{|-\n| \"inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.\"\n| &nbsp;\n| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''\n|}\nThere has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' \"neutrality\". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance\u2014that of [[free speech]]\u2014to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.\n\nTacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])\n\n<blockquote>Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.</blockquote>\n\nTacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81\u201396) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.\n\nNonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.\n\nIn general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).\n\n===Prose===\nHis Latin style is highly praised.<ref>Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: \"No other writer of Latin prose\u2014not even Cicero\u2014deploys so effectively the full resources of the language.\"</ref> His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic\u2014the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as \"harsh, unpleasant, and thorny\" and praised as \"grave, concise, and pithily eloquent\".\n\nA passage of [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|''Annals'' 1.1]], where Tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the last four [[Roman Emperor (Principate)#Julio-Claudian dynasty|emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty]], illustrates his style: \"The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred\",<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_1&oldid=3754977#1 The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1] Translation based on Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb (1876).

But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending \"\u2026-entibus \u2026-is\" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions\u2014which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.<ref>Ostler 2007, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: \"\u2026some writers\u2014notably the perverse genius Tacitus\u2014delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.\" \u2013 \"this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms\u2026only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.\"</ref>\n\nHis historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight\u2014though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.<ref>John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff</ref> He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any \"treasonous\" speech or writings\u2014and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64\u201366) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.\n\nTacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.\n\n==Sources==\nTacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.\n\nTacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34\u201335.\n\n==Editions==\n* Damon, Cynthia (2003) ''Tacitus: Histories Book I.'' Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.

These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.\n\nTacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').\n\n==Life==\nDetails about his personal life are scarce.

[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.''

There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother\u2014if Cornelius was indeed his father.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26</ref> The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W.

Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145</ref>\n\nHis ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]].

But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not.

This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:\n* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')\n* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')\n* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')\n* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')\n* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')\n\n===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===\nThe ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.<ref>[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', \"in thirty volumes\".</ref>\nAlthough Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the ''Annals'' survived in a single manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany, and the second half in a single manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.\n\n====The ''Histories''====\n{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}\nIn an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains\u2014as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]\u2014a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.\n\n====The ''Annals''====\n{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].\n[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]\n\n===Monographs===\nTacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.\n\n====''Germania''====\n{{Main|Germania (book)}}\n\nThe ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1\u201327) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10\u201313).\n\n====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====\n{{Main|Agricola (book)}}\nThe ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014Oxford Revised Translation).\n\n====''Dialogus''====\n{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]\nThere is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.\n\n==Literary style==\nTacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.\n\nIn most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.\n\n===Approach to history===\nTacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating\u2014often pessimistic\u2014insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:\n:{|-\n| \"inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.\"\n| &nbsp;\n| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''\n|}\nThere has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' \"neutrality\". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance\u2014that of [[free speech]]\u2014to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.\n\nTacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])\n\n<blockquote>Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.</blockquote>\n\nTacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81\u201396) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.\n\nNonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.\n\nIn general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).\n\n===Prose===\nHis Latin style is highly praised.<ref>Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: \"No other writer of Latin prose\u2014not even Cicero\u2014deploys so effectively the full resources of the language.\"</ref> His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic\u2014the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as \"harsh, unpleasant, and thorny\" and praised as \"grave, concise, and pithily eloquent\".\n\nA passage of [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|''Annals'' 1.1]], where Tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the last four [[Roman Emperor (Principate)#Julio-Claudian dynasty|emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty]], illustrates his style: \"The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred\",<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_1&oldid=3754977#1 The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1] Translation based on Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb (1876).

But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending \"\u2026-entibus \u2026-is\" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions\u2014which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.<ref>Ostler 2007, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: \"\u2026some writers\u2014notably the perverse genius Tacitus\u2014delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.\" \u2013 \"this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms\u2026only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.\"</ref>\n\nHis historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight\u2014though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.<ref>John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff</ref> He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any \"treasonous\" speech or writings\u2014and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64\u201366) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.\n\nTacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.\n\n==Sources==\nTacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.\n\nTacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34\u201335.\n\n==Editions==\n* Damon, Cynthia (2003) ''Tacitus: Histories Book I.'' Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.

It was the de facto capital of [[al-Andalus]] as the heart of the administration and government was within its walls.\n\nBuilt beginning in 936-940, the city included ceremonial reception halls, mosques, administrative and government offices, gardens, a mint, workshops, barracks, residences and baths. Water was supplied through aqueducts.<ref name=\"Ruggles\">{{Cite book|last=Ruggles|first=D. Fairchild|authorlink=D. Fairchild Ruggles|title=Islamic Gardens and Landscapes|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicgardensla0000rugg/page/152 152\u2013153]|isbn=0-8122-4025-1|url=https://archive.org/details/islamicgardensla0000rugg/page/152}}</ref>\n\nThe main reason for its construction was politico-ideological: the dignity of the Caliph required the establishment of a new city, a symbol of his power, imitating other Eastern [[Caliphate]]s. It was built in C\u00f3rdoba because it had been the capital of the region ([[Hispania Baetica|Betis]]) in [[Roman empire|Roman times]]; this made it easier for the Emirate and Caliphate of Cordoba to rule, while they existed, over al-Andalus. Above all, it demonstrated his superiority over his great rivals, the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] of [[Ifriqiya]] in Northern Africa, as well as the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in [[Baghdad]]. Legend also says it was built as a tribute for the Caliph's favorite wife: Azahara.<ref>[http://www.mezquitadecordoba.org/en/medinaazaharaguidevisits.htm Medina Azahara Guide]</ref> The complex was extended during the reign of Abd ar-Rahman III's son [[Al-Hakam II]] (r. 961\u2013976), but after his death soon ceased to be the main residence of the Caliphs. In 1010 it was sacked in a civil war, and thereafter abandoned, with many elements re-used elsewhere. Its ruins were excavated starting from the 1910s.  Only about 10 percent of the 112 hectares (0.43 sq&nbsp;mi) have been excavated and restored, but this area includes the central area, with \"two caliphal residences, with associated bath complexes, two aristocratic residences, and service quarters ... spaces associated with the palace guard; some large administrative buildings ... the extraordinary court complex presided over by the reception hall ... the great garden spaces, and just outside this area, the congregational mosque\".<ref>Triano, 3</ref> \n\n==Location==\nLocated {{convert|4|miles}} west of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]] in the foothills of the [[Sierra Morena]], oriented north-to-south on the slopes of ''Jabal al-Arus'' (meaning Bride Hill), and facing the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]] river, is Madinat az-Zahra, billed as the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. It was chosen for its outstanding landscape values, allowing a hierarchical construction program so the city and the plains beyond its feet were physically and visually dominated by the buildings of the [[Alc\u00e1zar|fortress]].\n\nThere was also a quarry of [[limestone]], used for the primary construction, though other stones from an area 50&nbsp;km around were also used.<ref>Triano, 4-5</ref>  The city's construction led to a road, water and supply infrastructure partly preserved until today in the form of remains of roads, quarries, aqueducts and bridges.\n\nThe topography played a decisive role in shaping the city. Taking full advantage of the uneven terrain, the palace city of Madinat az-Zahra was distributed in three terraces. Unlike the labyrinthine and chaotic character typical of Muslim urbanism, the site of the city adopted a rectangular shape comprising an area of 112 hectares. It extended {{convert|1500|m}} per side from east to west and about {{convert|750|m}} from north to south, just warped on the north side by the need to adapt to the difficult topography of the terrain.\n\nIts location in the foothills of Sierra Morena made it possible to design an urban program in which the location and physical relationships between the various constructions were expressive of the role of each in the setting. The palace was located at a higher level, and staggered its buildings along the side of the mountain in an expression of clear preeminence over the urban hamlets and the Aljama Mosque spread across the plains below. Following the terraces, the first corresponds to the residential area of the caliph, next comes the official area including the houses of the viziers, the guard-room, administrative offices and gardens. Next is the city proper, with housing, crafts, and the great mosque of the two lower terraces separated by another wall in order to isolate the upper palace complex. Archaeological research {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} has revealed an urban morphology characterized by the existence of large areas of undeveloped land, which serves to empty the entire southern front of the fortress, ensuring privacy and maintaining an open, idyllic country landscape. The only spaces built on the lowest level are two broad bands: the western, with an urban management orthogon, and the eastern, with less rigid planning.\n\nThere were two complexes outside but close by the city, one a large [[villa]] at the centre of a large agricultural estate, later given to the state treasurer.  The other, Turru\u00f1uelos, was a huge rectangular building, perhaps a [[barracks]].<ref>Triano, 5</ref>\n\n==Palace area==\n[[File:Edificio Basilical Superior de Medina Azahara (C\u00f3rdoba, Espa\u00f1a).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Upper basilical hall\" or \"Dar al-Jund\", perhaps for administration.]]\nThe palace was built where the 1st century [[Roman aqueduct]] running from the [[Sierra Morena]] to Cordoba ran, but this was several metres below the palace, so a new spur was constructed further back to bring permanent running water to the higher levels. In turn, the section of the old Roman aqueduct now diverted was used as a main [[sewerage|sewer]] for a highly complex system of small channels carrying away rain and waste water. Many food and ceramic remains have been found here.<ref>Triano, 8-12</ref>\n\nThe initial construction of the palace was very rapid: begun in 936 or 940, the mosque was completed in 941 and by 945 the caliph was in residence, moving in the mint by 947. However, construction continued for decades, with many changes of plan and examples building-over previous buildings.  The reception hall of Abd-ar-Rahman, or \"Salon Rico\", can be dated by inscriptions to between 953 and 957. The large \"House of Ja'far\" is built over three earlier houses,<ref>Triano, 12-19</ref> and the building known as the \"Court of the Pillars\" replaced two earlier ones in the mid-950s.<ref>Triano, 19-23</ref> The other large hall remaining, the so-called \"upper basilical hall\" or \"Dar al-Jund\" (\"House of the Army\", a name mentioned in literary sources) was also probably built in the 950s.<ref>Triano, 23</ref>\n\nIn 2020, archaeologists discovered a gateway, that marked the eastern entrance to the 10th-century palace, which was missing for more than a thousand years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lost-gateway-of-fabled-medina-azahara-unearthed-in-southern-spain-5bl5sndd7|title=Lost gateway of fabled Medina Azahara unearthed in southern Spain|website=The Times|date=13 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gardens==\nThere were at least three gardens in the city. A small garden, referred to as ''The Prince's Garden'', was located on the upper terrace. This garden was for the use of the nobility, the wealthy, and the powerful; those who frequented the palace itself.<ref name=Ruggles/>\n\nThe two lower terraces supported huge, formal [[Islamic garden]]s. The westernmost of these was the lowest terrace of the city. The easternmost of these two lower gardens, the middle terrace, led to the reception hall known as the ''Salon Rico''. This eastern garden had a pavilion, surrounded by four rectangular pools, at its center. The four quadrants of this garden were sunken, and supplied with water from channels along the connecting walkways.<ref name=Ruggles/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mezquita de Medina Azahara.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Mezquita (mosque) Aljama]]\n[[File:Decoraci\u00f3n de Medina Azahara (C\u00f3rdoba, Espa\u00f1a).jpg|thumb|180px<!--UPRIGHT-->|[[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] panel]]\nThe city, which  flourished for approximately 80 years, was built by caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] [[Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba|of C\u00f3rdoba]] starting between 936 and 940.  After he had proclaimed himself [[caliph]] in 928, he decided to show his subjects and the world his power by building a palace-city 5&nbsp;km from  C\u00f3rdoba. The largest known city built from scratch in Western Europe, it would be described by travelers from northern Europe and from the East as a dazzling series of palaces full of treasures never seen before. Around 1010, Madinat az-Zahra was sacked by [[Berbers|Berber]] rebels as part of a larger rebellion that led to the dissolution of the Caliphate of Cordoba.<ref>O'Callaghan, Joseph F., ''A History of Medieval Spain'', Cornell University Press, 1975, Cornell Paperback 1983, p. 132</ref> The raid effectively wiped the city off the map for a millennium.\n\nPopular legend holds that the Caliph named az-Zahra, or Azahara, after his favorite [[concubine]], and that a statue of a woman stood over the entrance. Others, imagining his demanding lover, say that he built this new city just to please her. The truth, however, has probably more to do with politics than love. Abd ar-Rahman III ordered the construction of this city at a time when he had just finished consolidating his political power in the Iberian Peninsula and was entering into conflict with the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] dynasty for the control of North Africa.  Zahara means 'shining, radiant or blossoming' in Arabic:  the name communicates aspirations of power and status, not romantic love.\n\nAz-Zahra is the most common title for the daughter of Muhammad [[Fatimah]] az-Zahra. As such, the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] dynasty of North Africa adorned many buildings and even towns with her name. Her title az-Zahra (the brilliant) was given to the al-Az'har/[[al-Azhar University]] in Cairo in 968, built by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]]. The Umayyads' ambitions in North Africa could well explain the usage of the name for the new city to rival the  Fatimids' influence there through Islamic/ religious iconography.\n\nIn 929, Abd ar-Rahman III declared himself utterly independent, the true Caliph (Prince of Believers) and descendant of the [[Umayyad dynasty]], which had nearly been completely exterminated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the 9th century. He brought about a series of political, economic and ideological measures to impress his legitimacy upon the world. A new capital city, befitting his status, was one of those measures. He decided to build the city in 936 and construction took about forty years. The Mosque on the site was consecrated in 941 and in 947 the government was transferred from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]].<ref>Barrucand, Marianne & Bednorz, Achim, ''Moorish Architecture in Andalusia'', Taschen, 2002, p. 61</ref>\n\nIn 2005, it was described by the American newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|Teeming with treasures that dazzled the most jaded traveler or world\u2014weary aristocrat...Pools of mercury could be shaken to spray beams of reflected sunlight across marble walls and ceilings of gold...

The 112 hectare-urb was no mere pleasure palace for weekend excursions, but the effective capital of [[al-Andalus]], the territory controlled by the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula from the beginning of the 8th century to the middle of the 11th. The magnificent white city, built in steps into the hillside at the base of the [[Sierra Morena]] with the Caliph's palace at the highest point, was designed to be seen by his subjects and foreign ambassadors for kilometers. Abd ar-Rahman III moved his entire court to Medina Azahara in 947-48.\n\nWith time the entire city was buried, not to be unearthed until 1911.<ref>D. F. Ruggles, \u201cHistoriography and the Rediscovery of Madinat al-Zahra',\u201d Islamic Studies (Islamabad), 30 (1991): 129-40</ref> Excavation and restoration continues, depending upon funding by the Spanish government. The unexcavated portion, however, is threatened by the illegal construction of housing.  According to the ''New York Times'', \"The local government in C\u00f3rdoba, he said, has failed to enforce a law passed 10 years ago that expanded protections for the site against development... Construction companies are putting up houses on the site of the city, 90 percent of which remains unexcavated.\" <ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nArtistically, the Medina Azahara played a great role in formulating a distinct Andalusian [[Islamic architecture]]. Many of its features, such as basilical royal reception halls (as contrasted with domed ones in the eastern part of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]) are here conceived for the first time. Other features, such as the arranging of the suites of rooms around a central courtyard or garden, are echoed throughout western Islamic architecture, for example as late as in the [[Alhambra]]. The Mosque of Medina Azahara bears close resemblance to the [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]]; it has been called its \"little sister\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Barrucand|first= Marianne |author2=Achim Bednorz|title=Moorish Architecture in Andalusia|publisher=Taschen|year=2002|page=64}}</ref>\n\nBefore coming to power, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]] (also called Almanzor, from Spanish name) lived in the suburbs of C\u00f3rdoba. On becoming the [[Hajib]] (Chamberlain to the Caliph) he decided to build a palace city for himself, which, if not more, was as beautiful as Medina Azahara built by [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]].{{sfn|Bariani|2002}} The palace was to be located just opposite to Al-Zahra, which was situated in the west of C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Bariani|2002}} Mansur called his palace with a very similar name : [[Madinah Az-Zahira]].{{sfn|Bariani|2002}}\n\nMansur's purpose behind building this palace was to inspire awe and to have his name written in the pages of history along with the name of the greatest king of [[Al-Andalus]], Abd-ar-Rahman III.  It was a beautiful palace with extensive gardens around it. It housed the High officials and barracks for the guards of Al-Mansur.\n\nHowever, on the death of Al-Mansur in 1002, his eldest son Abd al Malik Al-Muzafer succeeded to the throne, and on his death Abdar Rehaman As-Sanjul or Sanchelo or little Sancho (his mother Abda, was a daughter of Sancho the king of Pamplona), another son of Al-Mansur, followed his brother. People rose in revolt in C\u00f3rdoba, while Sanchelo was busy in his expedition against Alfonso V in December 1009. Since Sanchelo was absent and there was nothing else in sight toward which to vent their anger, the people looted the palace built by Al-Mansur for four days. when they were through with the looting and plundering the palace, they put it to flames, and in no time the beautiful Az-Zahira was reduced to ashes.\n\n==Access and conservation==\nThere are issues about the management of the site which is being affected by modern housing developments.\n\nA museum on the edge of the site has been built low, with much of the space underground, to minimize disruption to the views of the landscape from the ruins.<ref>[http://www.dezeen.com/2009/12/16/museum-and-research-centre-madinat-al-zahra-by-nieto-sobejano-arquitectos/ Museum and research centre by Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos].</ref> The museum, which was designed by the firm [[Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos]], won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2010.\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the site was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] with the inscription name \"Caliphate City of Medina Azahara\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1560|title=Caliphate City of Medina Azahara|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Barrucand|first= Marianne |author2=Achim Bednorz|title=Moorish Architecture in Andalusia|publisher=Taschen|year=2002}}\n*D.

It was the de facto capital of [[al-Andalus]] as the heart of the administration and government was within its walls.\n\nBuilt beginning in 936-940, the city included ceremonial reception halls, mosques, administrative and government offices, gardens, a mint, workshops, barracks, residences and baths. Water was supplied through aqueducts.<ref name=\"Ruggles\">{{Cite book|last=Ruggles|first=D. Fairchild|authorlink=D. Fairchild Ruggles|title=Islamic Gardens and Landscapes|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicgardensla0000rugg/page/152 152\u2013153]|isbn=0-8122-4025-1|url=https://archive.org/details/islamicgardensla0000rugg/page/152}}</ref>\n\nThe main reason for its construction was politico-ideological: the dignity of the Caliph required the establishment of a new city, a symbol of his power, imitating other Eastern [[Caliphate]]s. It was built in C\u00f3rdoba because it had been the capital of the region ([[Hispania Baetica|Betis]]) in [[Roman empire|Roman times]]; this made it easier for the Emirate and Caliphate of Cordoba to rule, while they existed, over al-Andalus. Above all, it demonstrated his superiority over his great rivals, the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] of [[Ifriqiya]] in Northern Africa, as well as the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in [[Baghdad]]. Legend also says it was built as a tribute for the Caliph's favorite wife: Azahara.<ref>[http://www.mezquitadecordoba.org/en/medinaazaharaguidevisits.htm Medina Azahara Guide]</ref> The complex was extended during the reign of Abd ar-Rahman III's son [[Al-Hakam II]] (r. 961\u2013976), but after his death soon ceased to be the main residence of the Caliphs. In 1010 it was sacked in a civil war, and thereafter abandoned, with many elements re-used elsewhere. Its ruins were excavated starting from the 1910s.  Only about 10 percent of the 112 hectares (0.43 sq&nbsp;mi) have been excavated and restored, but this area includes the central area, with \"two caliphal residences, with associated bath complexes, two aristocratic residences, and service quarters ... spaces associated with the palace guard; some large administrative buildings ... the extraordinary court complex presided over by the reception hall ... the great garden spaces, and just outside this area, the congregational mosque\".<ref>Triano, 3</ref> \n\n==Location==\nLocated {{convert|4|miles}} west of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]] in the foothills of the [[Sierra Morena]], oriented north-to-south on the slopes of ''Jabal al-Arus'' (meaning Bride Hill), and facing the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]] river, is Madinat az-Zahra, billed as the [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. It was chosen for its outstanding landscape values, allowing a hierarchical construction program so the city and the plains beyond its feet were physically and visually dominated by the buildings of the [[Alc\u00e1zar|fortress]].\n\nThere was also a quarry of [[limestone]], used for the primary construction, though other stones from an area 50&nbsp;km around were also used.<ref>Triano, 4-5</ref>  The city's construction led to a road, water and supply infrastructure partly preserved until today in the form of remains of roads, quarries, aqueducts and bridges.\n\nThe topography played a decisive role in shaping the city. Taking full advantage of the uneven terrain, the palace city of Madinat az-Zahra was distributed in three terraces. Unlike the labyrinthine and chaotic character typical of Muslim urbanism, the site of the city adopted a rectangular shape comprising an area of 112 hectares. It extended {{convert|1500|m}} per side from east to west and about {{convert|750|m}} from north to south, just warped on the north side by the need to adapt to the difficult topography of the terrain.\n\nIts location in the foothills of Sierra Morena made it possible to design an urban program in which the location and physical relationships between the various constructions were expressive of the role of each in the setting. The palace was located at a higher level, and staggered its buildings along the side of the mountain in an expression of clear preeminence over the urban hamlets and the Aljama Mosque spread across the plains below. Following the terraces, the first corresponds to the residential area of the caliph, next comes the official area including the houses of the viziers, the guard-room, administrative offices and gardens. Next is the city proper, with housing, crafts, and the great mosque of the two lower terraces separated by another wall in order to isolate the upper palace complex. Archaeological research {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} has revealed an urban morphology characterized by the existence of large areas of undeveloped land, which serves to empty the entire southern front of the fortress, ensuring privacy and maintaining an open, idyllic country landscape. The only spaces built on the lowest level are two broad bands: the western, with an urban management orthogon, and the eastern, with less rigid planning.\n\nThere were two complexes outside but close by the city, one a large [[villa]] at the centre of a large agricultural estate, later given to the state treasurer.  The other, Turru\u00f1uelos, was a huge rectangular building, perhaps a [[barracks]].<ref>Triano, 5</ref>\n\n==Palace area==\n[[File:Edificio Basilical Superior de Medina Azahara (C\u00f3rdoba, Espa\u00f1a).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Upper basilical hall\" or \"Dar al-Jund\", perhaps for administration.]]\nThe palace was built where the 1st century [[Roman aqueduct]] running from the [[Sierra Morena]] to Cordoba ran, but this was several metres below the palace, so a new spur was constructed further back to bring permanent running water to the higher levels. In turn, the section of the old Roman aqueduct now diverted was used as a main [[sewerage|sewer]] for a highly complex system of small channels carrying away rain and waste water. Many food and ceramic remains have been found here.<ref>Triano, 8-12</ref>\n\nThe initial construction of the palace was very rapid: begun in 936 or 940, the mosque was completed in 941 and by 945 the caliph was in residence, moving in the mint by 947. However, construction continued for decades, with many changes of plan and examples building-over previous buildings.  The reception hall of Abd-ar-Rahman, or \"Salon Rico\", can be dated by inscriptions to between 953 and 957. The large \"House of Ja'far\" is built over three earlier houses,<ref>Triano, 12-19</ref> and the building known as the \"Court of the Pillars\" replaced two earlier ones in the mid-950s.<ref>Triano, 19-23</ref> The other large hall remaining, the so-called \"upper basilical hall\" or \"Dar al-Jund\" (\"House of the Army\", a name mentioned in literary sources) was also probably built in the 950s.<ref>Triano, 23</ref>\n\nIn 2020, archaeologists discovered a gateway, that marked the eastern entrance to the 10th-century palace, which was missing for more than a thousand years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lost-gateway-of-fabled-medina-azahara-unearthed-in-southern-spain-5bl5sndd7|title=Lost gateway of fabled Medina Azahara unearthed in southern Spain|website=The Times|date=13 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Gardens==\nThere were at least three gardens in the city. A small garden, referred to as ''The Prince's Garden'', was located on the upper terrace. This garden was for the use of the nobility, the wealthy, and the powerful; those who frequented the palace itself.<ref name=Ruggles/>\n\nThe two lower terraces supported huge, formal [[Islamic garden]]s. The westernmost of these was the lowest terrace of the city. The easternmost of these two lower gardens, the middle terrace, led to the reception hall known as the ''Salon Rico''. This eastern garden had a pavilion, surrounded by four rectangular pools, at its center. The four quadrants of this garden were sunken, and supplied with water from channels along the connecting walkways.<ref name=Ruggles/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mezquita de Medina Azahara.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Mezquita (mosque) Aljama]]\n[[File:Decoraci\u00f3n de Medina Azahara (C\u00f3rdoba, Espa\u00f1a).jpg|thumb|180px<!--UPRIGHT-->|[[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] panel]]\nThe city, which  flourished for approximately 80 years, was built by caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] [[Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba|of C\u00f3rdoba]] starting between 936 and 940.  After he had proclaimed himself [[caliph]] in 928, he decided to show his subjects and the world his power by building a palace-city 5&nbsp;km from  C\u00f3rdoba. The largest known city built from scratch in Western Europe, it would be described by travelers from northern Europe and from the East as a dazzling series of palaces full of treasures never seen before. Around 1010, Madinat az-Zahra was sacked by [[Berbers|Berber]] rebels as part of a larger rebellion that led to the dissolution of the Caliphate of Cordoba.<ref>O'Callaghan, Joseph F., ''A History of Medieval Spain'', Cornell University Press, 1975, Cornell Paperback 1983, p. 132</ref> The raid effectively wiped the city off the map for a millennium.\n\nPopular legend holds that the Caliph named az-Zahra, or Azahara, after his favorite [[concubine]], and that a statue of a woman stood over the entrance. Others, imagining his demanding lover, say that he built this new city just to please her. The truth, however, has probably more to do with politics than love. Abd ar-Rahman III ordered the construction of this city at a time when he had just finished consolidating his political power in the Iberian Peninsula and was entering into conflict with the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] dynasty for the control of North Africa.  Zahara means 'shining, radiant or blossoming' in Arabic:  the name communicates aspirations of power and status, not romantic love.\n\nAz-Zahra is the most common title for the daughter of Muhammad [[Fatimah]] az-Zahra. As such, the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] dynasty of North Africa adorned many buildings and even towns with her name. Her title az-Zahra (the brilliant) was given to the al-Az'har/[[al-Azhar University]] in Cairo in 968, built by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]]. The Umayyads' ambitions in North Africa could well explain the usage of the name for the new city to rival the  Fatimids' influence there through Islamic/ religious iconography.\n\nIn 929, Abd ar-Rahman III declared himself utterly independent, the true Caliph (Prince of Believers) and descendant of the [[Umayyad dynasty]], which had nearly been completely exterminated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the 9th century. He brought about a series of political, economic and ideological measures to impress his legitimacy upon the world. A new capital city, befitting his status, was one of those measures. He decided to build the city in 936 and construction took about forty years. The Mosque on the site was consecrated in 941 and in 947 the government was transferred from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]].<ref>Barrucand, Marianne & Bednorz, Achim, ''Moorish Architecture in Andalusia'', Taschen, 2002, p. 61</ref>\n\nIn 2005, it was described by the American newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|Teeming with treasures that dazzled the most jaded traveler or world\u2014weary aristocrat...Pools of mercury could be shaken to spray beams of reflected sunlight across marble walls and ceilings of gold... Doors carved of ivory and ebony led to sprawling gardens full of exotic animals and sculptures made of amber and pearls...\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/16/international/europe/16spain.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Growth in Spain Threatens a Jewel of Medieval Islam | first=Renwick | last=McLean | date=2005-08-16 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>}}\n\nWhat is visible of the ruins of Madinat az-Zahra today is only 10% of its extent. The 112 hectare-urb was no mere pleasure palace for weekend excursions, but the effective capital of [[al-Andalus]], the territory controlled by the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula from the beginning of the 8th century to the middle of the 11th. The magnificent white city, built in steps into the hillside at the base of the [[Sierra Morena]] with the Caliph's palace at the highest point, was designed to be seen by his subjects and foreign ambassadors for kilometers. Abd ar-Rahman III moved his entire court to Medina Azahara in 947-48.\n\nWith time the entire city was buried, not to be unearthed until 1911.<ref>D. F. Ruggles, \u201cHistoriography and the Rediscovery of Madinat al-Zahra',\u201d Islamic Studies (Islamabad), 30 (1991): 129-40</ref> Excavation and restoration continues, depending upon funding by the Spanish government. The unexcavated portion, however, is threatened by the illegal construction of housing.  According to the ''New York Times'', \"The local government in C\u00f3rdoba, he said, has failed to enforce a law passed 10 years ago that expanded protections for the site against development... Construction companies are putting up houses on the site of the city, 90 percent of which remains unexcavated.\" <ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nArtistically, the Medina Azahara played a great role in formulating a distinct Andalusian [[Islamic architecture]]. Many of its features, such as basilical royal reception halls (as contrasted with domed ones in the eastern part of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]) are here conceived for the first time. Other features, such as the arranging of the suites of rooms around a central courtyard or garden, are echoed throughout western Islamic architecture, for example as late as in the [[Alhambra]]. The Mosque of Medina Azahara bears close resemblance to the [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]]; it has been called its \"little sister\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Barrucand|first= Marianne |author2=Achim Bednorz|title=Moorish Architecture in Andalusia|publisher=Taschen|year=2002|page=64}}</ref>\n\nBefore coming to power, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]] (also called Almanzor, from Spanish name) lived in the suburbs of C\u00f3rdoba. On becoming the [[Hajib]] (Chamberlain to the Caliph) he decided to build a palace city for himself, which, if not more, was as beautiful as Medina Azahara built by [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]].{{sfn|Bariani|2002}} The palace was to be located just opposite to Al-Zahra, which was situated in the west of C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Bariani|2002}} Mansur called his palace with a very similar name : [[Madinah Az-Zahira]].{{sfn|Bariani|2002}}\n\nMansur's purpose behind building this palace was to inspire awe and to have his name written in the pages of history along with the name of the greatest king of [[Al-Andalus]], Abd-ar-Rahman III.  It was a beautiful palace with extensive gardens around it. It housed the High officials and barracks for the guards of Al-Mansur.\n\nHowever, on the death of Al-Mansur in 1002, his eldest son Abd al Malik Al-Muzafer succeeded to the throne, and on his death Abdar Rehaman As-Sanjul or Sanchelo or little Sancho (his mother Abda, was a daughter of Sancho the king of Pamplona), another son of Al-Mansur, followed his brother. People rose in revolt in C\u00f3rdoba, while Sanchelo was busy in his expedition against Alfonso V in December 1009. Since Sanchelo was absent and there was nothing else in sight toward which to vent their anger, the people looted the palace built by Al-Mansur for four days. when they were through with the looting and plundering the palace, they put it to flames, and in no time the beautiful Az-Zahira was reduced to ashes.\n\n==Access and conservation==\nThere are issues about the management of the site which is being affected by modern housing developments.\n\nA museum on the edge of the site has been built low, with much of the space underground, to minimize disruption to the views of the landscape from the ruins.<ref>[http://www.dezeen.com/2009/12/16/museum-and-research-centre-madinat-al-zahra-by-nieto-sobejano-arquitectos/ Museum and research centre by Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos].</ref> The museum, which was designed by the firm [[Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos]], won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2010.\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the site was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] with the inscription name \"Caliphate City of Medina Azahara\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1560|title=Caliphate City of Medina Azahara|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Barrucand|first= Marianne |author2=Achim Bednorz|title=Moorish Architecture in Andalusia|publisher=Taschen|year=2002}}\n*D.
