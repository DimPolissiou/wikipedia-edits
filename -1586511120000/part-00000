The airport serves both as a military and as a civil airport. With its relatively small apron, as of 2018 the airport is only able to serve up to 6 civilian planes at the same time. Santorini is one of the few [[Cyclades]] Islands with a major airport.\n\nThe airport is located about 6&nbsp;km southeast of the centre of the city of Thira. The main asphalt runway (16L-34R) is 6972 feet/2125m in length. The parallel taxiway was built to runway specification and is labeled 16R-34L. The airfield can accommodate medium sized jets like the [[Boeing 757]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus 320]] series as well as smaller aircraft such as the [[Avro RJ]], [[Fokker 70]], and [[ATR 72]]. Scheduled airlines include [[Ryanair]], [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]], with seasonal scheduled and charter flights from other airlines during the higher seasons in spring, summer and Autumn. Transportation to and from the air terminal is through buses, taxis, hotel car-pickups and hire cars.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kamari and airport.jpg|thumb|Kamari town and Santorini International

2015 the privatisation of Santorini (Thira) International Airport and 13 other regional airports of Greece was finalised with the signing of the agreement between the [[Fraport#|Fraport AG]]/Copelouzos Group joint venture and the state privatisation fund.<ref>{{cite

The airport serves both as a military and as a civil airport. With its relatively small apron, as of 2018 the airport is only able to serve up to 6 civilian planes at the same time. Santorini is one of the few [[Cyclades]] Islands with a major airport.\n\nThe airport is located about 6&nbsp;km southeast of the centre of the city of Thira. The main asphalt runway (16L-34R) is 6972 feet/2125m in length. The parallel taxiway was built to runway specification and is labeled 16R-34L. The airfield can accommodate medium sized jets like the [[Boeing 757]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus 320]] series as well as smaller aircraft such as the [[Avro RJ]], [[Fokker 70]], and [[ATR 72]]. Scheduled airlines include [[Ryanair]], [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]], with seasonal scheduled and charter flights from other airlines during the higher seasons in spring, summer and Autumn. Transportation to and from the air terminal is through buses, taxis, hotel car-pickups and hire cars.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Kamari and airport.jpg|thumb|Kamari town and Santorini International

Bracken became abundant after the arrival of M\u0101ori, \"mainly a result of burning to create open landscapes for access and ease of travel\" (McGlone et al., 2005:1). Rhizomes were dug in early summer and then dried for use in the winter. Although it was not liked as much as kumara, it was appreciated for its ready availability and the ease with which it could be stored (Orbell 1998:29).\n\nThe rhizomes were air-dried so that they could be stored and become lighter. When ready for consumption, they were briefly heated and then softened with a ''patu aruhe'' (rhizome pounder); the starch could then be sucked from the fibres, or collected to be prepared for a larger feast. Several distinct styles of ''Patu aruhe'' were developed.\n\nThe plants of the bracken genus (''[[Bracken|Pteridium]]'') contain the known [[carcinogen]] [[ptaquiloside]],<ref>Fletcher M.T., Hayes P.Y., Somerville M.J., De Voss J.J.\"Ptesculentoside, a novel norsesquiterpene glucoside from the Australian bracken fern Pteridium esculentum\".

Other streets in Celebration include:\n\n;Celebration Avenue: This is considered the main road in the town. The road stretches from [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. 192]] to Artisan Park where it ends in a [[traffic circle]]. Starting from U.S. 192 near the Disney Parks and the Celebration water tower, you can find a small shopping plaza. From there, Celebration Avenue passes the North Village, splits the Celebration golf course, winds through a few down-town shops and schools, and then proceeds into the parks and homes in the newer sections of Celebration.\n;Celebration Boulevard: Celebration Boulevard has two sections. The most public section is an avenue parallel to [[Interstate 4|I-4]] that includes many commercial businesses and [[Celebration High School]]. The architecture on the street is mostly Celebration Modern style. This style reflects art [[Streamline Moderne]] and  [[Art Deco]] influences with its sleek lines, sparse but effective ornamentation, and ample opportunities for individually expressive special features. The entire street is lined with two rows of [[Arecaceae|Washington Palms]]. The buildings on the street include sitting areas under the shade of trees and trellises along their frontage. The other section of Celebration Boulevard lies on the other side of the golf course, closer to the Celebration Water Tower in the North Village. Here, Celebration Boulevard is almost completely residential. In addition to the homes perched behind white picket fences, this section of Celebration Boulevard flows past the Georgetown condominiums, the community pool, and soccer fields.\n;Celebration Place: Celebration Place nearly spans the gap between the two sections of Celebration Boulevard, except that its eastern end terminates at the Water Tower Plaza instead of at the entrance to North Village on the other side of [[Florida State Road 417|State Road 417]]. Celebration Place is a commercial road.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:West Osceola Branch Library, Celebration.jpg|thumb|West Osceola Branch Library]]\nThe [[School District of Osceola County, Florida]], operates public schools in Celebration.<ref>\"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US1211285&_bucket_id=50&tree_id=420&context=saff&_lang=en&_sse=on Celebration CDP, Florida]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\" [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

North Village, closest to U.S. 192, houses the Georgetown Condos as well as Acadia Estate Homes. East Village includes [[Roseville Corner]] and Aquila Loop. Lake Evalyn, generally considered its own area of Celebration but not quite its own village, includes a small lake where one can find a multitude of ducks, alligators, and the occasional river otter. South Village houses the Spring Park Loop estate homes and Heritage Hall. Additionally, Siena Condos complete the outer edge of South Village by Celebration Blvd. Mirasol includes condos with concierge service and a day spa. [[Artisan Park]] is at the end of Celebration Ave and houses condos, townhomes, single-family residences as well as a clubhouse consisting of a pool, gym, and restaurant.\n\n===Events===\n[[File:Celebration, Florida.jpg|thumb|A gathering in Celebration on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]]]\nCelebration hosts many celebrations every year, including community-wide yard sales, an art show, an exotic car festival, an annual Radio Disney Holiday concert, an Oktoberfest Celebration, the \"Great American Pie Festival\" (televised on [[The Food Network]]),<ref>\"[http://www.piecouncil.org/Events/GreatAmericanPieFestival/ Great American Pie Festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111014514/http://www.piecouncil.org/Events/GreatAmericanPieFestival/ |date=November 11, 2013 }}\"</ref> a \"Posh Pooch\" festival, and downtown events for the Fall and Christmas seasons when autumn leaves and \"snow\" (small-scale soap flakes) are released into the Town Center.

Other streets in Celebration include:\n\n;Celebration Avenue: This is considered the main road in the town. The road stretches from [[U.S. Route 192|U.S. 192]] to Artisan Park where it ends in a [[traffic circle]]. Starting from U.S. 192 near the Disney Parks and the Celebration water tower, you can find a small shopping plaza. From there, Celebration Avenue passes the North Village, splits the Celebration golf course, winds through a few down-town shops and schools, and then proceeds into the parks and homes in the newer sections of Celebration.\n;Celebration Boulevard: Celebration Boulevard has two sections. The most public section is an avenue parallel to [[Interstate 4|I-4]] that includes many commercial businesses and [[Celebration High School]]. The architecture on the street is mostly Celebration Modern style. This style reflects art [[Streamline Moderne]] and  [[Art Deco]] influences with its sleek lines, sparse but effective ornamentation, and ample opportunities for individually expressive special features. The entire street is lined with two rows of [[Arecaceae|Washington Palms]]. The buildings on the street include sitting areas under the shade of trees and trellises along their frontage. The other section of Celebration Boulevard lies on the other side of the golf course, closer to the Celebration Water Tower in the North Village. Here, Celebration Boulevard is almost completely residential. In addition to the homes perched behind white picket fences, this section of Celebration Boulevard flows past the Georgetown condominiums, the community pool, and soccer fields.\n;Celebration Place: Celebration Place nearly spans the gap between the two sections of Celebration Boulevard, except that its eastern end terminates at the Water Tower Plaza instead of at the entrance to North Village on the other side of [[Florida State Road 417|State Road 417]]. Celebration Place is a commercial road.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:West Osceola Branch Library, Celebration.jpg|thumb|West Osceola Branch Library]]\nThe [[School District of Osceola County, Florida]], operates public schools in Celebration.<ref>\"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US1211285&_bucket_id=50&tree_id=420&context=saff&_lang=en&_sse=on Celebration CDP, Florida]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\" [[U.S. Census Bureau]].
