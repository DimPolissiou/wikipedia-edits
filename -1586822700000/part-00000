The kingdom has its origins in the conflict in the buffer region between the [[Francia|Frankish king]] [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|Umayyad Emirate]] that controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula.  The city of Pamplona ({{lang-la|Pompaelo}}; {{lang-eu|Iru\u00f1ea}}), had been the main city of the indigenous [[Vascones|Vasconic]] population and was located amid a predominantly Basque-speaking area.<ref>{{cite book |last=Trask |first=Robert.L. |date=1996 |title=The History of Basque |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUDaAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA427&lpg=PA427&dq=trask+basque+kingdom+of+navarre&source=bl&ots=X4PaSvGC-6&sig=dDFFsR1yXXTzSFrqx9DkCmk8OWM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMIg6Lcm9nExwIVwrYUCh36yQ0Y#v=onepage&q=trask%20basque%20kingdom%20of%20navarre&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=427|isbn= 0-415-13116-2}}</ref><ref>Collins, R. 1989, p. 159</ref>  In an event traditionally dated to 824, [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista of Pamplona|\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista]] was elected or declared ruler of the area around Pamplona in opposition to [[Francia|Frankish expansion]] into the region, originally as vassal to the C\u00f3rdoba Emirate.  This polity evolved into the Kingdom of Pamplona. In the first quarter of the 10th century the Kingdom was able to briefly break its vassalage under C\u00f3rdoba and expand militarily, but again found itself dominated by C\u00f3rdoba until the early 11th century.  A series of partitions and dynastic changes led to a diminution of its territory and to periods of rule by the kings of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] (1054\u20131134) and [[Kingdom of France|France]] (1285\u20131328).\n\nIn the 15th century, another dynastic dispute over control by the king of Aragon led to internal divisions and the eventual conquest of the southern part of the kingdom by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1512 (permanently in 1524). It was annexed by the Courts of Castile to the Crown of Castile in 1515. The remaining northern part of the kingdom was again joined with France by [[personal union]] in 1589 when King Henry III of Navarre inherited the French throne as [[Henry IV of France]], and in 1620 it was merged into the [[Kingdom of France]]. The monarchs of this unified state took the title \"King of France and Navarre\" until its fall in the [[French Revolution]], and again during the [[Bourbon Restoration]] from 1814 until 1830 (with a [[Hundred Days|brief interregnum in 1815]]).\n\nToday, significant parts of the ancient Kingdom of Navarre comprise the Spanish [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Navarre]], {{lang|es|[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma Vasca]]}} and {{lang|es|[[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]}} and the French community of {{lang|fr|[[Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Pays Basque|Pays Basque]]}}.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are similar earlier toponyms but the first documentation<ref name=\"Au\u00f1amendi\">[[Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa]]'s Spanish article on  [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/96788 Navarra] in the [[Au\u00f1amendi Entziklopedia]] (click on \"NAVARRA \u2013 NAFARROA (NOMBRE Y EMBLEMAS)\")</ref> of Latin {{lang|la|navarros}} appears in [[Eginhard]]'s chronicle of the feats of [[Charles the Great]].\nOther [[Royal Frankish Annals]] give ''nabarros''.\nThere are two proposed etymologies<ref name=\"Au\u00f1amendi\"/> for the name of {{lang|es|Navarra}}/{{lang|eu|Nafarroa}}/{{lang|eu|Naparroa}}:\n\n* Basque {{lang|eu|nabar}} (declined [[absolutive case|absolute]] [[grammatical number|singular]] {{lang|eu|nabarra}}): \"brownish\", \"multicolor\", which would be a contrast with the green mountain lands north of the original County of Navarre.\n* Basque {{lang|eu|naba}}, Castilian {{lang|es|nava}} (\"valley\", \"plain\", present across Spain) + Basque {{lang|eu|herri}} (\"people\", \"land\").\n\nThe linguist [[Joan Coromines]] considers ''naba'' as not clearly Basque in origin but as part of a wider [[Aquitanian language|pre-Roman]] substrate.\n\n==Early historic background==\n{{see also|Duchy of Vasconia}}\n\n[[File:Aquitani tribes map-fr.svg|thumb|left|250px|Tribes of the western Pyrenees.]]\nThe kingdom originated in the southern side of the western Pyrenees, in the flatlands around the city of [[Pamplona]].  According to Roman geographers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Livy]], these regions were inhabited by the [[Vascones]] and other related Vasconic-[[Aquitani]]an tribes, a pre-[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] group of peoples who inhabited the southern slopes of the western Pyrenees and part of the shore of the [[Bay of Biscay]].<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Navarre |volume=19 |pages=281\u2013282}}</ref> These tribes spoke an archaic version of the [[Basque language]], usually known by linguistics as [[Proto-Basque language|Proto-Basque]], as well as some other related languages, such as the [[Aquitanian language]].  The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took full control of the area by 74 BC, but unlike their northern neighbors, the Aquitanians, and other tribes from the Iberian Peninsula, the Vascones negotiated their status within the Roman Empire.{{Sfn|Collins|1990|pp=53\u201356}}  The region first was part of the Roman province of [[Hispania Citerior]], then of the [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. It would be under the jurisdiction of the {{lang|la|[[conventus iuridicus]]}} of Caesaraugusta (modern [[Zaragoza]]).\n\nThe Roman empire influenced the area in urbanization, language, infrastructure, commerce, and industry.  During the [[Sertorian War]], [[Pompey]] would command the foundation of a city in Vasconic territory, giving origin to ''Pompaelo'', modern-day Pamplona, founded on a previously existent Vasconic town. [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of the Vascones led to their eventual adoption of forms of [[Latin]] that would evolve into the [[Navarro-Aragonese]] language, though the Basque language would remain widely spoken, especially in rural and mountainous areas.\n\nAfter the decline of the Western Roman Empire, the Vascones were slow to be incorporated into the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which was in a civil war that provided the opportunity for the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. The Basque leadership probably joined in the appeal that, in the hope of stability, brought the Muslim conquerors. By 718, Pamplona had formed a pact that allowed a wide degree of autonomy in exchange for military and political subjugation, along with the payment of tribute to [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|C\u00f3rdoba]].{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=277}}  Burial ornamentation shows strong contacts with the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] France and the Gascons of [[Aquitaine]], but also items with [[Islam]]ic inscriptions, while a Muslim cemetery in Pamplona, the use of which spanned several generations, suggests the presence of a Muslim garrison in the decades following the [[Arab]] invasion.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nThe origin and foundation of the Kingdom of Pamplona is intrinsically related to the southern expansion of the [[Francia|Frankish kingdom]] under the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] and their successors, the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]]. About 601, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] ({{lang-la|Wasconiae}}) was established by the Merovingians, based around Roman [[Novempopulania]] and extending from the southern branch of the river [[Garonne]] to the northern side of the [[Pyrenees]]. The first documented Duke of Vasconia was [[Genial]], who would hold that position until 627.\n\nThe Duchy of Vasconia then became a frontier territory with varying levels of autonomy granted by the Merovingian monarchs. The suppression of the Duchy of Vasconia as well as the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] by the Carolingians would lead to a rebellion, led by [[Lupo II of Gascony]]. [[Pepin the Short]] launched a punitive [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|War in Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768) that put down the uprising and resulted in the division of the Duchy into several counties, ruled from [[Toulouse]]. Similarly, across the eastern Pyrenees the [[Marca Hisp\u00e1nica]] was established next to the [[Septimania|Marca Gothica]], a Frankish attempt at creating [[buffer state]]s between the [[Carolingian empire]] and the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nThe Franks under Charlemagne extended their influence and control southward, occupying several regions of the north and east of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is unclear how solidly the Franks exercised control over Pamplona. In 778, Charlemagne was invited by rebellious Muslim lords on the [[Upper March]] of [[Al-Andalus]] to lead an expedition south with the intention of taking the city of [[Zaragoza]] from the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. However, the expedition was a failure, and the Frankish army was forced to withdraw. During their retreat, they destroyed the city walls of Pamplona to weaken the city and avoid a possible rebellion,{{Sfn|Jimeno Jur\u00edo|2004|p=}} reminiscent of the approach the Carolingians had used elsewhere against Christian cities that seemed content to live under C\u00f3rdoban control.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=280}}\n\nHowever, while moving through the Pyrenees on 15 August 778, the rearguard of the Frankish army, led by [[Roland]] was attacked by the Basque tribes in a confrontation that came to be known as the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. [[Roland]] was killed and the rearguard scattered. As a response to the attempted Frankish seizure of Zaragoza, the C\u00f3rdoban emir retook the city of Pamplona and its surrounding lands. In 781 two local Basque lords, ''Ibn Balask'' (\"son of Velasco\"), and ''Mothmin al-Akra'' (\"Jimeno ''the Strong''\") were defeated and forced to submit.  The next mention of Pamplona is in 799, when Mutarrif ibn Musa, thought to have been a governor of the city and a member of the [[Muladi|muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] family, was killed there by a pro-Frankish faction.\n\nDuring this period, Basque territory extended on the west to somewhere around the headwaters of the [[Ebro]] river.{{sfn|Collins|1989|p=159}} Equally [[Einhart]]'s ''Vita Karoli Magni'' pinpoints the source of the Ebro in the land of the Navarrese.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ein.html In the 15th paragraph], the Carolingian chronicler states, \"ipse per bella memorata primo Aquitaniam et Wasconiam totumque Pyrinei montis iugum et usque ad Hiberum amnem, qui apud Navarros ortus et fertilissimos Hispaniae agros secans\".</ref> However, this western region fell under the influence of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].\n\n[[File:Pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica 814.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Duchy of Vasconia]] in 814.]]\n\nThe Franks renewed their attempts to control the region and in 806 took Navarre under their protection. Following a truce between the Frankish kingdom and C\u00f3rdoba, in 812 [[Louis the Pious]] went to Pamplona, likely to establish there a county that would prove short-lived.  However, continued rebellion in Gascony rendered Frankish control south of the Pyrenees tenuous,{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=281}} and the Emirate was able to reclaim the region following victory in the 816 [[Battle of Pancorbo (816)|Battle of Pancorbo]], in which they defeated and killed the \"enemy of Allah\", ''Balask al-Yalaski'' (Velasco the Gascon), along with the uncle of [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], Garcia ibn Lubb ('son of Lupus'), Sancho, the 'premier knight of Pamplona', and the pagan warrior ''\u1e62alt\u0101n''. North of the Pyrenees in the same year, Louis the Pious removed [[Seguin I of Gascony |Seguin]] as Duke of Vasconia, which initiated a rebellion,<ref>\"Louis the Pious\", Rene Poupardin, ''The Cambridge Medieval History: Germany and the Western Empire'', Vol. III, ed. J.B.Bury, (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 8.</ref>\nled by [[Garc\u00eda I Jim\u00e9nez of Gascony|Garcia Jim\u00e9nez]], who was killed in 818. Louis's son [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], then King of Aquitaine, stamped out the Vasconic revolt in [[Gascony]] then hunted the chieftains who had taken refuge in southern Vasconia, i.e., Pamplona and Navarre, no longer controlled by the Franks. He sent an army led by the counts [[Aeblus]] and [[Aznar Sanchez of Gascony|Aznar Sanchez]] (the latter being appointed lord, but not duke, of Vasconia by Pepin after suppressing the uprising in the Duchy), accomplishing their goals with no resistance in Pamplona (which still lacked walls after the 778 destruction). On the way back, however, [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824) |they were ambushed and defeated]] in Roncevaux by a force probably composed both of Basques and the C\u00f3rdoba-allied muwallad [[Banu Qasi]].\n\n==Nascent state and kingdom==\n\n===Establishment by I\u00f1igo Arista===\n\nOut of the pattern of competing Frankish and C\u00f3rdoban interests, the Basque chieftain [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista of Pamplona|\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista]] took power.<ref>\"Du nouveau sur le royaume de Pampelune au IXe si\u00e8cle\", \u00c9variste L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al, ''Bulletin Hispanique'', 1953, Volume 55, Issue 55-1, page 11; \"''Mais, en ce qui concerne le roi vascon Inigo Iniguez...''\"</ref> Tradition tells he was elected as king of Pamplona in 824, giving rise to a dynasty of kings in Pamplona that would last for eighty years.  However, the region around Pamplona continued to fall within the sphere of influence of C\u00f3rdoba, presumably as part of its broader frontier region, the [[Upper March]], ruled by \u00cd\u00f1igo's half-brother, [[Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi]]. The city was allowed to remain [[Christianity|Christian]] and have its own administration but had to pay the traditional taxes to the Emirate,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=324}} including the ''[[jizya]]'' assessed on non-Muslims living under their control.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=284}} \u00cd\u00f1igo Arista is mentioned in Arab records as ''s\u00e2hib'' (lord) or ''am\u00eer'' of the Vascones (''bashkunish'') and not as ''malik'' (king) or ''t\u00e2giya'' (tyrant) used for the kings of Asturias and France, indicating the lower status of these ''ul\u00fbj'' (barbarians, not accepting Islam) within the C\u00f3rdoba sphere.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002 |p=404}}{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=281}} In 841, in concert with Musa ibn Musa, \u00cd\u00f1igo rebelled and though Musa was eventually forced to submit, \u00cd\u00f1igo was still in rebellion at the time of his death in 851/2.\n\nPamplona and Navarre are distinguished in Carolingian chronicles. Pamplona is cited in 778 as a Navarrese stronghold, while this may be put down to their vague knowledge of the Basque territory.

Neither of these kings would make significant territorial expansion.  This period of a fractious, but in the end subservient, Navarre came to an end amidst a period when generalized rebellion within the Emirate prevented them from being able to suppress the inertial forces in the western Pyrenees.  The ineffectual Fort\u00fan was forced to abdicate in favor of a new dynasty from the vehemently anti-Muslim east of Navarre, the founders of which took a less accommodationist view. With this change, al-Andalus sources shift to calling the Pamplona rulers 'tyrants', as with the independent kings of Asturias: Pamplona had passed out of the C\u00f3rdoban sphere.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|pp=284\u2013286}}\n\n===Jim\u00e9nez rule===\n\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 910-es.svg|thumb|right|The Kingdom of Pamplona (Navarra, orange) c. 910]]\n\nAfter taking the political power from Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s, [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho Garc\u00e9s]] (905\u2013925), son of Dadilde, sister of [[Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza]], proclaimed himself king,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=405}} terminating the alliance with the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba and expanding its domains through the course of the [[Ega (river)|River Ega]] all the way south to the [[Ebro]] and taking the regions of [[N\u00e1jera]] and [[Calahorra]], which caused the decline of the [[Banu Qasi]] family, who ruled these lands. As a response, [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] undertook two expeditions to these lands, earning a victory at the [[Battle of Valdejunquera]], after which the Emirate retook the lands south of the river [[Ebro]], and by 924 attacked Pamplona. The daughter of Sancho Garc\u00e9s, Sancha, was married to the [[Kingdom of Leon|King of Leon]] [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]], establishing an alliance with the Leonese kingdom and ensuring the Calahorra region.

He was a man of unbreakable devotion to the faith of Christ, pious with all the faithful and merciful with oppressed Catholics. What more? In all his actions he performed as a great warrior against the people of the [[Muslims|Ismailites]]; he inflicted multiple disasters on the Saracens. This same captured all the fortified places in the [[Duchy of Cantabria|Cantabria]], from the city of [[N\u00e1jera]] to [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]]. Indeed he possessed all the land of Degium [Monjard\u00edn, near [[Estella-Lizarra|Lizarra]]] with its towns. The \"Arba\" of Pamplona he submitted to his law, and conquered as well all the country of [[Aragon]] [then [[Jaca]] and nearby lands] with its fortresses. Later, after suppressing all infidels, the twentieth year of his reign he left this world. Buried in the portal of Saint Stephen [Monjard\u00edn], he reigns with Christ in Heaven (King Sancho Garc\u00e9s died in the era 964 [925]).}}\n\nAfter the death of Sancho Garc\u00e9s, the crown passed to his brother, [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona|Jimeno Garc\u00e9s]] (925\u2013931), joined by Sancho's underage son, [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez]] (931\u2013970), in his last year.  Garc\u00eda continued to rule under the tutelage of his mother, Sancho's widow Toda Aznarez, who also engineered several political marriages with the other Christian kingdoms and counties of northern Iberia.  Oneca was married to [[Alfonso IV of Le\u00f3n]] and her sister [[Urraca S\u00e1nchez of Pamplona|Urraca]] to [[Ramiro II of Le\u00f3n]], while other daughters of Sancho were married to counts of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[County of \u00c1lava|\u00c1lava]] and [[County of Bigorre|Bigorre]]. The marriage of the Pamplonese king Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez with [[Andregoto Gal\u00edndez]], daughter of [[Galindo Azn\u00e1rez II]], [[County of Aragon|Count of Aragon]] linked the eastern county to the Kingdom.  In 934, he invited [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] to intervene in the kingdom in order to emancipate himself from his mother, and this began a period of tributary status by Pamplona and frequent punitive campaigns from C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nGarc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez's heir, [[Sancho II of Pamplona|Sancho II]] (970\u2013994), set up his half brother, [[Ramiro Garc\u00e9s of Viguera]], to rule in the short-lived Kingdom of Viguera. The ''Historia General de Navarra'' by [[Jaime del Burgo]] says that on the occasion of the donation of the [[villa]] of Alastue by the king of Pamplona to the monastery of [[San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]] in 987, he styled himself \"King of Navarre\", the first time that title had been used. In many places he appears as the first King of Navarre and in others the third; however, he was at least the seventh [[king of Pamplona]].\n\nDuring the late 10th century, [[Almanzor]], the ruler of [[Al Andalus]], frequently led raids against the Christian kingdoms, and attacked the Pamplonese lands on at least nine occasions. In 966, clashes between the Islamic factions and the Kingdom resulted in the loss of Calahorra and the valley of the [[Cidacos|river Cidacos]]. Sancho II, while allied with Castilian militias, suffered a grave defeat in the Battle of Torrevicente. Sancho II was forced to hand over one of his daughters and one of his sons as tokens of peace. After the death of Sancho II and during the reign of [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II]], Pamplona was attacked by the Caliphate on several occasions, being completely destroyed in 999,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=407}} the King himself killed during a raid in the year 1000.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|1993|pp=73\u201378}}\n\nAfter the death of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II, the crown passed to [[Sancho III of Navarre|Sancho III]], just eight years old at the time, and probably completely controlled by the Caliphate.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|1993|p=78}} During the first years of his reign the Kingdom was ruled by his cousins Sancho and Garc\u00eda of Viguera until the year 1004, when Sancho III would become ruling king, mentored by his mother Jimena Fern\u00e1ndez. The links with Castile became stronger through marriages. The death of Almanzor in 1002 and his successor [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] in 1008 caused the decline of the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the progress of the [[Kingdom of Castile|County of Castile]] south, while Pamplona, led by Sancho Garc\u00e9s III, strengthen the position of his kingdom on the borderlands of the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]], controlling the territories of [[Loarre]], [[Funes, Navarra|Funes]], [[Sos del Rey Cat\u00f3lico|Sos]], [[Uncastillo]], Arlas, [[Caparroso]] and [[Bolta\u00f1a]].{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=82}}{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=408}}\n\n[[File:Pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica 1000.svg|thumb|right|250px|The Kingdom of Pamplona (dark orange) in 1000.]]\n\nIn the year 1011 Sancho III married [[Muniadona of Castile]], daughter of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Count of Castile]] [[Sancho Garc\u00eda of Castile|Sancho Garc\u00eda]]. In 1016 the County of Castile and the Kingdom of Navarre made a pact on their future expansion: Pamplona would expand towards the south and east, the eastern region of [[Province of Soria|Soria]] and the [[Ebro]] valley, including territories that were at the time part of [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]].{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=83}} Thus, the Kingdom of Pamplona comprised a territory of 15,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 between Pamplona, N\u00e1jera and Arag\u00f3n with vassals of Pamplonese and Aragonese origin.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=408}}\n\nThe assassination of Count [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez of Castile]] in 1028 allowed Sancho to appoint his younger son Ferdinand as count. He also exerted a protectorate over the [[Duchy of Gascony]]. He seized the country of the Pisuerga and the Cea, which belonged to the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], and marched armies to the heart of that kingdom, forcing king [[Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n]] to flee to a Galician refuge. Sancho thereby effectively ruled the north of Iberia from the boundaries of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to those of the count of Barcelona.\n\nBy the time of the death of Sancho III in 1035, the Kingdom had reached its greatest historical extent. Sancho III wrote a problematic will, in which he divided his territory into three kingdoms.\n\n===Ecclesiastical affairs===\nIn this period of independence, the ecclesiastical affairs of the country reached a high state of development.  Sancho the Great was brought up at [[Monastery of Leyre|Leyre]], which was also for a short time the capital of the [[Diocese of Pamplona]]. Beside this see, there existed the [[Bishopric of Oca]], which was united in 1079 to the [[Diocese of Burgos]]. In 1035 Sancho III re-established the [[See of Palencia]], which had been laid waste at the time of the Moorish invasion.  When, in 1045, the city of Calahorra was wrested from the Moors, under whose dominion it had been for more than three hundred years, a see was also founded there, which in the same year absorbed the [[Diocese of Najera]] and, in 1088, the [[Diocese of Alava]], the jurisdiction of which covered about the same ground as that of the present [[Diocese of Vitoria]]. The See of Pamplona owed its re-establishment to Sancho III, who for this purpose convened a synod at Leyre in 1022 and one at Pamplona in 1023. These synods likewise instituted a reform of ecclesiastical life, with the above-named convent as a centre.\n\n==Dismemberment==\n\n===Division of Sancho's domains===\n[[File:Kingdom of Pamplona (c.1000).gif|thumb|right|Domains of Sancho III ''the Great''<br>{{legend|red|Kingdom of Pamplona}}{{legend|#ff8000|other possessions}}{{legend|#ff80ff|direct influence}}]]\n\nAt its greatest extent the Kingdom of Navarre included all the modern Spanish province; the northern slope of the western Pyrenees the Spaniards called the ''ultra puertos'' (\"country beyond the mountain passes\") or French Navarre; the Basque provinces of Spain and France; the Bureba, the valley between the Basque mountains and the Montes de Oca to the north of [[Burgos]]; and the Rioja and Tarazona in the upper valley of the Ebro.<ref name=EB1911/> On his death, Sancho divided his possessions among his four sons. Sancho the Great's realm was never again united (until [[Ferdinand the Catholic]]): Castile was permanently joined to Leon, whereas Aragon enlarged its territory, joining Catalonia through a marriage.\n\nFollowing the traditional succession customs, the first-born son of Sancho III, [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III]], received the title and lands of the Kingdom of Pamplona, which included the territory of [[Pamplona]], [[N\u00e1jera]] and parts of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]]. The rest of the territory was given to his widow Muniadona to split among all the legitimate sons: thus Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III also received the territory to the northeast from the County of Castile ([[La Bureba]], [[Montes de Oca (comarca)|Montes de Oca]]) and the [[County of \u00c1lava]]. [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand]] received the rest of the [[County of Castile]] and the lands between the Pisuerga and the Cea. Another son of Sancho, [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]], received the counties of [[Sobrarbe]] and [[County of Ribagorza|Ribargoza]] as vassal of his eldest brother, Garc\u00eda. Lands in [[County of Aragon|Aragon]] were allotted to Sancho's bastard son [[Ramiro I of Aragon|Ramiro]].{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=84}}{{Sfn|Mart\u00ednez D\u00edez|2005|p=715, Vol. II}}{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p= 409}}\n\n===Partition and union with Aragon===\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 1037-es.svg|thumb|Navarre (yellow) in 1037]]\n[[File:AntsoVIIArrano.JPG|thumb|Seal of King [[Sancho VII of Navarre|Sancho VII the Strong]]]]\nGarc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III (1035\u20131054) soon found himself struggling for supremacy against his ambitious brothers, especially Ferdinand. Garc\u00eda had supported the armed conflict between Ferdinand and his brother-in-law [[Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n]], who was ultimately killed in the [[Battle of Tamar\u00f3n]] (1037). This allowed Ferdinand to unite his Castilian county with the new-won crown of Le\u00f3n as king Ferdinand I.  For several years a mutual collaboration between the two kingdoms took place. The relationship between Garc\u00eda and his step-brother Ramiro was better. The latter had acquired all of Aragon, Ribagorza and Sobrarbe on the sudden death of his brother Gonzalo, forming what would become the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].  Garc\u00eda and Ramiro's alliance with [[Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer]], the [[Count of Barcelona]], was effective to keep the Muslim [[Taifa of Zaragoza]] at bay. After the capture of [[Calahorra]] in 1044, a period peace followed on the southern border and trade was established with Zaragoza.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|pp=85-86}}\n\nThe relationship between Garc\u00eda and Ferdinand deteriorated with time, the two disputing the lands on the Pamplonese-Castilian border,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p= 410}} and ended violently in September 1054 at the [[Battle of Atapuerca]], in which Garc\u00eda was killed, and Ferdinand took from Pamplona the lands in [[La Bureba]] and the [[Tir\u00f3n River]].{{Sfn|Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza|1993|p=106 }}\n\nGarc\u00eda was succeeded by [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]] (1054\u20131076) ''of Pe\u00f1al\u00e9n'', whom Ferdinand had recognised as king of Pamplona immediately after the death of his father.  He was fourteen years old at the time, and under the regency of his mother Estefan\u00eda and his uncles Ferdinand and Ramiro.  After the death of his mother in 1058, Sancho IV lost the support of the local nobility, and the relations between them worsened after he became allied with [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir]], ruler of Zaragoza.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=86}} On 4 June 1076, a conspiracy involving Sancho IV's brother Ram\u00f3n and sister Ermesinda ended with the murder of the king. The neighboring kingdoms and the nobility probably had a part in the plot.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=87}}\n\nThe dynastic crisis resulting from Sancho's assassination worked to the benefit of the Castilian and Aragonese monarchs. [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] took control of [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], the [[Lordship of Biscay]], the [[County of \u00c1lava]], the [[County of Durango]] and part of [[Gipuzkoa]].{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p= 411}} [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]], successor to his father, Ramiro of Aragon, took control of the rest of the territory and was recognised as king by the Pamplonese nobility.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=87}} The land around the city of Pamplona, the core of the original kingdom, became known as the County of Navarre, and was recognised by Alfonso VI as a vassal state of the kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Castile. Sancho Ram\u00edrez began in 1084 a renewed military expansion of the southern lands controlled by Muslim forces. That year, the city of [[Arguedas, Navarre|Arguedas]], from which the [[Bardenas Reales|Bardenas]] region could be controlled, was taken. After the death of Sancho Ram\u00edrez in 1094, he was succeeded by [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|Peter I]], who resumed the expansion of the territory, taking the cities of [[S\u00e1daba]] in 1096 and [[Milagro, Navarre|Milagro]] in 1098, while threatening [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]].{{Sfn|Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza|1993|p= 98 and 102}}\n\n[[Alfonso the Battler]] (1104\u20131134), brother of Peter I, secured for the country its greatest territorial expansion. He wrested [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] from the Moors (1114), re-conquered the entire country of Bureba, which Navarre had lost in 1042, and advanced into the current [[Province of Burgos]]. He also annexed [[Labourd]], with its strategic port of [[Bayonne]], but lost its coastal half to the English soon after. The remainder has been part of Navarre since then and eventually came to be known as [[Lower Navarre]].  Toward the south, he moved the Islamic border to the [[Ebro]] river, with [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], N\u00e1jera, [[Logro\u00f1o]], [[Calahorra]], and [[Alfaro, La Rioja|Alfaro]] added to his domain. \nIn 1118, the city of [[Zaragoza]] was taken by the Aragonese forces, and on 25 February 1119 the city of Tudela was taken and incorporated into Pamplona.{{Sfn|Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza|1993|p=104}}\n\nThe 1127 [[Peace of T\u00e1mara]] delimited the territorial domains of the Castilian and Aragonese realms, the latter including Pamplona. The lands of [[Lordship of Biscay|Biscay]], [[County of \u00c1lava|\u00c1lava]], [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Belorado]], [[Soria]] and [[San Esteban de Gormaz]] went back to the Pamplonese kingdom.{{Sfn|Serrano Izko|2006|p=125}}\n\n===Restoration and the loss of western Navarre===\n[[File:Reparto del reino de Navarra tras la muerte de Sancho IV El de Pe\u00f1al\u00e9n.svg|thumb|'''Division of the Kingdom of Pamplona after the death of Sancho Garc\u00e9s IV in 1076'''\n{{legend|#eeaaff|Area occupied by [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile]]}}\n{{legend|#ffaaaa|Area occupied by [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez|Sancho Ram\u00edrez of Aragon]]}}\n{{legend|#87de87|County of Navarre, vassal of Castile}}]]\n\nThe status quo between Aragon and Castile stood until the 1134 death of Alfonso. Being childless, he willed his realm to the military orders, particularly the [[Knights Templar|Templars]]. This decision was rejected by the courts (parliaments) of both Aragon and Navarre, which then chose separate kings.\n\n[[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], known as ''the Restorer'', is the first King of Navarre to use such a title. He was Lord of [[Monz\u00f3n]], a grandson of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, [[El Cid]], and a descendant by illegitimate line of king Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III. [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho Garcia]], known as Sancho VI \"the Wise\" (1150\u20131194), a patron of learning, as well as an accomplished statesman, fortified Navarre within and without, granted charters (fueros) to a number of towns, and was never defeated in battle. He was the first king to issue royal documents entitling him ''rex Navarrae'' or ''rex Navarrorum'', appealing to a wider power base, defined as politico-juridical by Urzainqui (a \"populus\"), beyond [[Pamplona]] and the customary ''rex Pampilonensium''.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=94}} As attested in the charters of San Sebasti\u00e1n and Vitoria-Gasteiz (1181), the natives are called ''Navarri'', as well as in another contemporary document at least, where those living to the north of [[Peralta, Navarre|Peralta]] are defined as Navarrese.<ref>But not the inhabitants of Peralta; the ''lingua navarrorum'' is attested as the Basque language.</ref>\n\n''The Restorer'' and [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho the Wise]] were faced with an ever-increasing intervention of Castile in Navarre. In 1170, [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] and [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], daughter of Henry II Plantagenet, married, with the Castilian king claiming [[Gascony]] as part of the dowry. It turned out a much needed pretext for the invasion of Navarre during the following years (1173\u20131176), with a special focus on Navarre's coastal districts, coveted by Castile in order to become a maritime power.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=111}} In 1177, the dispute was submitted to arbitration by [[Henry II of England]]. The Navarrese made their point on a number of claims, namely \"the proven will of the locals\" (''fide naturalium hominum suorum exhibita''), the assassination of the King [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho Garces IV of Navarre]] by the Castilians (''per violentiam fuit expulsus'', 1076), as well as law and custom, while the Castilians made their case by citing the Castilian takeover following the death of Sancho Garces IV, the dynastic links of Alfonso with Navarre, and the conquest of Toledo.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=152}} Henry did not dare issue a verdict based entirely on the legal grounds as presented by both sides, instead deciding to refer them back to the boundaries held by both kingdoms at the start of their reigns in 1158, besides agreeing to a truce of seven years. It thus confirmed the permanent loss of the Bureba and Rioja areas for the Navarrese.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=115}} However, soon, Castile breached the compromise, starting a renewed effort to harass Navarre both in the diplomatic and military arenas.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a 1190.jpg|thumb|Navarre (light green) in 1190]]\nThe rich dowry of [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]], daughter of [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI the Wise]] and Blanche of Castile, made her a desirable catch for [[Richard I of England]]. His aged mother, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], crossed the Pyrenean passes to escort Berengaria to Sicily, eventually to wed Richard in Cyprus, on 12 May 1191. She remains the only Queen of England who never set foot in England during her reign. The reign of Sancho the Wise's successor, the last king of the male line of Sancho the Great and the kings of Pamplona, Sancho VII the Strong (''Sancho el Fuerte'') (1194\u20131234), was more troubled. He appropriated the revenues of churches and convents, granting them instead important privileges; in 1198 he presented to the See of Pamplona his palaces and possessions there; this gift was confirmed by Pope Innocent III on 29 January 1199.\n\nIn 1199 Alfonso VIII of Castile, son of Sancho III of Castile and Blanche of Navarre, was determined to take over coastal Navarre, a strategic region that would allow Castile much easier access to European wool markets and would isolate Navarre as well. He launched a massive expedition against Navarre. [[Sancho VII of Navarre|Sancho the Strong]] was abroad in [[Tlemcen]] (modern Algeria) seeking support to counter the Castilian push, by opening a second front.

After nine months of siege, Vitoria surrendered, but Trevi\u00f1o did not, having to be conquered by force of arms. By 1200 the conquest of western Navarre was complete. Castile allowed these territories (with the exceptions of Trevi\u00f1o and [[O\u00f1ati]], which were directly ruled from Castile) the right to keep their traditional customs and laws (''viz.'', Navarrese law), which came to be known as [[fueros]]. Alava was made a county, Biscay a [[Lord of Biscay|lordship]] and Gipuzkoa just a province. In 1207, an arrangement in Guadalajara between both kings sealed a 5-year truce over the occupied territories; still Castile kept a ''[[wikt:Fait accompli|fait accompli]]'' policy.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza \n | first = Luis Javier\n | author-link = Stephen Bre...\n | title = La quiebra de la soberan\u00eda navarra en \u00c1lava, Guip\u00fazcoa y el Duranguesado (1199-1200) \n | journal = Euskomedia\n | volume = 45:2\n | pages = 486\n | date = 2000 }}</ref>\n\nSancho the Strong would join in the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212), where he added his small force to the Christian alliance that was victorious over the Caliph [[Muhammad al-Nasir|Muhammand An-Nasir]]. He suffered from a varicose ulcer in his leg that led him to retire to Tudela, where he died in 1234. His elder sister Berengaria, Queen of England, had died childless some years earlier. His deceased younger sister Blanca, countess of Champagne, had left a son, [[Theobald IV of Champagne]]. Thus the Kingdom of Navarre, though the crown was still claimed by the kings of Aragon, passed by marriage<ref name=EB1911/> to the House of Champagne, firstly to the heirs of Blanca, who were simultaneously [[Counts of Champagne|counts of Champagne and Brie]], with the support of the Navarrese Parliament (''Cortes'').\n\n==Navarre in the Late Middle Ages==\n===Rule by Champagne and France===\n[[File:Arms of the Monarchs Navarre (1328-1425) with the Royal Crest.svg|thumb|Arms of the Monarchs of Navarre of the [[House of \u00c9vreux]] with the Royal Crest]]\n[[File:Trait\u00e9 de Bretigny.svg|thumbnail|220px|right|Navarre possessions in France 1360]]\n[[File:Map_France_1477-en_sovereign_B%C3%A9arn.png|thumb|right|280px|Map of France and the Pyrenees in 1477 showing the Kingdom of Navarre and the Principality of B\u00e9arn]]\nTheobald I made of his court a centre where the poetry of the troubadours that had developed at the court of the counts of Champagne was welcomed and fostered; his reign was peaceful. His son, [[Theobald II of Navarre|King Theobald II]] (1253\u201370), married [[Isabella of France, Queen of Navarre|Isabella]], daughter of King [[Louis IX of France]], and accompanied his saintly father-in-law upon his crusade to Tunis. On the homeward journey, he died at Trapani in Sicily, and was succeeded by his brother, [[Henry I of Navarre|King Henry I]], who had already assumed the reins of government during his absence, but ruled for only three years (1271\u201374). His daughter, [[Joan I of Navarre|Queen Joan I]], ascended as a minor and the country was once again invaded from all sides. The queen and her mother, [[Blanche of Artois]], sought refuge at the court of King [[Philip III of France]]. His son, the future King [[Philip IV of France]], had become engaged to the young sovereign and married her in 1284. From 1276, the time of the negotiations for this marriage, Navarre effectively passed into French control, though not without the French suppression of native resistance in the 1276-1277 War of the Navarreria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Navarre remained in personal union with the Kingdom of France until the death of [[Charles IV of France|King Charles I (Charles IV of France)]] in 1328. He was succeeded by his niece, [[Joan II of Navarre|Queen Joanna II]], daughter of [[Louis X of France|King Louis I (Louis X of France)]], and nephew-in-law, [[Philip III of Navarre|King Philip III]]. Joanna waived all claim to the throne of France and accepted as compensation for the counties of Champagne and Brie those of [[Angoumois|Angoul\u00eame]], [[County of Longueville|Longueville]], and [[List of Counts of Mortain|Mortain]].\n\nKing Philip III devoted himself to the improvement of the laws of the country, and joined King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] in battle against the Moors of 1343. After the death of his mother (1349), [[Charles II of Navarre|King Charles II]] assumed the reins of government (1349\u201387). He played an important part in the [[Hundred Years' War]] and in the French civil unrest of the time, and on account of his deceit and cruelty he received the ephithet of 'the Bad'. He gained and lost possessions in [[Normandy]] and, later in his reign, the [[Navarrese Company]] acquired island possessions in Greece.\n\nHis eldest son, on the other hand, [[Charles III of Navarre|King Charles III]], 'the Noble', once more returned the land to peaceful and happy government (1387\u20131425).  He reformed the government, built canals, and made the tributaries of the Ebro flowing through Navarre navigable.  As he outlived his legitimate sons, he was succeeded by his daughter, [[Blanche I of Navarre|Queen Blanche I]] (1425\u201342), and son-in-law, [[John II of Aragon|King John II]] (1397\u20131479).\n\n===Navarre under the Foix and Albret dynasties===\n{{further|Navarrese Civil War (1451\u20131455)}}\n\nAfter Queen [[Blanche I of Navarre]]'s death in 1441, Navarre was mired in continued disputes over royal succession. King John II was ruling in Aragon in the name of his brother, [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]. He left his son, [[Charles, Prince of Viana]], with merely the rank of governor, whereas Queen Blanche I had intended him to succeed her, as was the custom. In 1450, John II himself came back to Navarre, and, urged on by his ambitious second wife [[Juana Enriquez]], endeavoured to obtain the succession for their son [[Ferdinand the Catholic|Ferdinand]].\n\nMirroring inter-clan disputes during the bloody [[War of the Bands]] in the rest of the Basque territories, in 1451 Navarre split in two confederacies, the Agramonts and the Beaumonts, over royal succession, with ramifications both within and outside Navarre. In the violent [[Navarrese Civil War (1451\u20131455)|civil war]] that broke out, the Agramonts sided with [[John II of Aragon|John II]], and the Beaumonts \u2014 named after their leader, the chancellor, John of Beaumont \u2014 espoused the cause of [[Charles, Prince of Viana]].<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\">Monreal, G./Jimeno, R.</ref>{{rp|15}} The fights involved the high aristocracy and their junior branches, who carried on the feuds of their senior lines and thrived on weak, often absent, royal authority.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=104}}{{rp|252}}\n\nThe unhappy prince Charles was defeated by his father at [[Aibar]] in 1451, and held prisoner for two years, during which he wrote his famous ''Chronicle of Navarre'', a major source for the period. After his release, Charles sought the assistance of King [[Charles VII of France]] and his uncle Alfonso V (who resided in Naples), but in vain. In 1460 he was again imprisoned at the instigation of his stepmother, but the [[History of Catalonia#The Crown of Aragon|Catalans]] rose in revolt at this injustice, and he was again liberated and named governor of Catalonia. He died in 1461, poisoned by his stepmother [[Juana Enr\u00edquez]] without being able to retake the reins of Navarre. He had named as heir his next sister, [[Blanche II of Navarre|Queen Blanche II]], but she was immediately imprisoned by John II and died in 1464. While this episode of the civil war came to an end, it inaugurated a period of instability including on-off periods of struggle and uprisings all the way to the Spanish conquest (1512).\n\nOn Charles' demise in 1461, [[Eleanor of Navarre]], Countess of [[Foix]] and [[B\u00e9arn]], was proclaimed Princess of Viana, but the instability took a toll.  The south-western tip of Navarre--the Sonsierra ([[Oy\u00f3n-Oion|Oyon]], [[Laguardia, \u00c1lava|Laguardia]], in present-day [[\u00c1lava]]), and [[Los Arcos]]--was occupied by [[Henry IV of Castile]].  Castile's eventual annexation of this territory in 1463 was upheld by the French king Louis XI in Bayonne on 23 April 1463.<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\">Monreal, G./Jimeno, R.</ref>{{rp|15}}  John II continued to rule as king up to 1479, when Queen Eleanor succeeded him for only 15 days and then died; she left the crown to her grandson, [[Francis Phoebus of Navarre|Francis Phoebus]], but this inaugurated another period of instability. Eleanor's 13-year-old granddaughter [[Catherine I of Navarre]] succeeded her brother Francis Phoebus in accordance with his will (1483). As a minor she remained under the guardianship of her mother, [[Magdalena of Valois]], and was sought by Ferdinand the Catholic as a bride. However, another claimant to the throne was stubbornly trying to stop her, [[John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne]], brother-in-law of the future King [[Louis XII of France]]. Invoking the French [[Salic Law]], he called himself King of Navarre and sent diplomats to Ferdinand II.\n\nPressure built on Catherine's regent Magdalena of Valois who, intent on saving their French possessions, eventually decided to marry the young Queen to the 7-year-old [[John of Albret]], despite the Parliament of Navarre's preference for John of Aragon, son of Ferdinand and Isabella.<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\"/>{{rp|17}}  The Beaumont party rose up, while the Agramonts split over the marriage. Ferdinand II of Aragon in turn reconsidered his diplomatic policy on Navarre. The crown of Navarre fell back on their default policy of diplomacy, and signed the Treaty of Valencia on 21 March 1488, whereby trade was restored between Navarre and the Aragon-Castile tandem. Still, Ferdinand did not recognize Catherine and installed Castilian troops in Navarre, banning French troops in both the kingdom and the principality of B\u00e9arn.<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\"/>{{rp|17}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 0em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#99FF99; color:black; width:20em; max-width:30%\" cellspacing=\"5\" \n| align=\"left\"| \"''Before the sacrament of the holy unction is completed, this blessed coronation of yours, it is necessary for Your Royal Majesties to swear an oath to the people, as the monarchs of Navarre preceding you did formerly, so that the people can also swear an oath to you as set by custom [...] we swear [...] to the prelates, nobles [...] and men of the cities and good towns and all the people of Navarre [...] from all across the Kingdom of Navarre [...] all the ''fueros'', as well as the mores, and customs, tax exemptions, liberties, privileges held by each of you&mdash;either here or absent.''\"\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Instructions to the monarchs Catherine and John III on the mandatory oath owed to the Kingdom of Navarre, and the oath itself, ahead of their coronation (1494).\n|}\nFerdinand also pushed for the introduction of the coercive cross-border tribunal, the [[Inquisition]], which the Navarrese hated, but, under pressure from the Aragonese monarch, the doors of Navarre (Tudela) finally opened to the Church institution between 1486 and 1488, pushed by the Aragonese monarch's threats. Still, in 1510 the authorities of Tudela decreed the expulsion of the monk \"calling himself inquisitor.\"  Catherine and John III also lacked French royal support: both [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and [[Louis XII of France]] pushed hard to have John of Foix declared king.  Finally, following a short period of peace with Ferdinand after a treaty was signed, in January 1494 the coronation of the royal family took place in Pamplona. The monarchs Catherine I and John III swore an oath to respect the liberties of Navarre, and the proclamation was celebrated with a week-long festival, while the ceremony was not attended by the Aragonese bishops with jurisdiction in Navarre. During this period, the realm of Navarre-Be\u00e1rn was defined by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]]'s diplomat M\u00fcntzer as a nation like Switzerland.<ref name=\"ConqNavRef\">Urzainqui, T./Esarte, P./Et al.</ref>{{rp|16}}  In the same treaty, Ferdinand renounced war on Navarre or [[B\u00e9arn]] from Castile, but the attempt to restore royal authority and patrimony met with the resistance of the defiant count of Lerin, Louis of Beaumont, whose estates were confiscated.\n\nCatherine and John III's guardian Magdalena of Valois died in 1495 and John's father [[Alain I of Albret]] signed another treaty with Ferdinand, whereby the count of Ler\u00edn should abandon Navarre, receiving in compensation real estate and various enclaves in the recently conquered Granada. In exchange, Alain made an array of painful concessions: Ferdinand received the count of Ler\u00edn's patrimony and gained control of important fortresses across Navarre, including the right to keep a garrison in [[Olite]] at the heart of the kingdom. Also, Queen Catherine's 1-year-old daughter Magdalena was to be sent to Castile to be raised, with a plan on a future marriage &mdash; she would die young in Castile (1504).<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\"/>{{rp|18\u201319}} Following developments in France, the whole treaty was reverted in 1500 and another compromise was reached with Ferdinand, ensuring peace for another 4 years.\n\n===Spanish conquest===\n[[File:Madeleine_of_France,_bethroted_of_Ladislaus_the_Posthumous.jpg|thumb|upright|Magdalena of Valois, regent of Navarre from 1479 to 1494, and mother of Queen [[Catherine I of Navarre]]]]{{main|Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre}}\nIn spite of the treaties, Ferdinand the Catholic did not relinquish his long-cherished designs on Navarre. In 1506, the 53-year-old widower remarried, to [[Germaine of Foix]] (aged 16), daughter of Catherine's uncle John of Foix, who had attempted to claim Navarre over his under-age nephew and niece. However, their infant son died shortly after birth, ending hopes of a possible inheritance of Navarre. Ferdinand kept intervening directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of Navarre by means of the Beaumont party. In 1508, the Navarrese royal troops finally suppressed a rebellion of the count of Lerin after a long standoff. In a letter to the rebellious count, the king of Aragon insisted that while he may take over one stronghold or another, he should use \"''theft, deceit and bargain''\" instead of violence (23 July 1509).\n\nWhen Navarre refused to join one of many Holy Leagues against France and declared itself neutral, Ferdinand asked the Pope to excommunicate Albret, which would have legitimised an attack. The Pope was reluctant to label the Crown of Navarre as schismatic explicitly in a first bull against the French and the Navarrese (21 July 1512), but Ferdinand's pressure bore fruit when a (second) bull named Catherine and John III \"heretic\" (18 February 1513). On 18 July 1512, [[Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 2nd Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique de Toledo]] was sent to invade Navarre in the context of the second phase of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].\n\nUnable to face the powerful Castilian-Aragonese army, Jean d'Albret fled to B\u00e9arn (Orthez, [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Tarbes). Pamplona, Estella, Olite, Sanguesa, and Tudela were captured by September. The Agramont party sided with Queen Catherine while most, but not all, of the Beaumont party lords supported the occupiers. In October 1512, the legitimate King John III returned with an army recruited north of the Pyrenees and attacked Pamplona without success. By the end of December the Castilians were in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port.\n\nAfter this failure, the Navarrese ''Cortes'' (Parliament) had no option but pledge loyalty to King Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1513, the first Castilian viceroy took a formal oath to respect Navarrese institutions and law (''[[fueros]]'').  The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was extended into Navarre.  The Jews had already been forced into conversion or exile by the [[Alhambra Decree]] in Castile and Aragon, and now the Jewish community of Navarre and the Muslims of Tudela suffered its persecution.\n[[File:Jeanne d'Albret.JPG|thumb|upright|Jeanne III]]\n[[File:Polverel_Tableau_Navarre.png|thumb|upright|Defense of Navarre presented by Polverel (1789)]]\nThere were two more attempts at liberation in 1516 and 1521, both supported by popular rebellion, especially the second one. It was in 1521 that the Navarrese came closest to regaining their independence. As a liberation army commanded by [[Andr\u00e9 de Foix|General Asparros]] approached Pamplona, the citizens rose in revolt and besieged the military governor, [[Ignatius Loyola|I\u00f1igo de Loyola]], in his newly built castle. Tudela and other cities also declared their loyalty to the House of Albret.  While at first distracted due to only recently overcoming the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], the Navarrese-B\u00e9arnese army managed to liberate all the Kingdom, but shortly thereafter Asparros faced a large Castilian army at the [[Battle of Esquiroz|Battle of No\u00e1in]] on 30 June 1521. Asparros was captured, and the army completely defeated.\n\n===Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees===\nA small portion of Navarre north of the Pyrenees, [[Lower Navarre]], along with the neighbouring [[Viscounty of B\u00e9arn|Principality of B\u00e9arn]] survived as an independent kingdom which passed by inheritance. Navarre received from [[Henry II of Navarre|King Henry II]], the son of Queen Catherine and King John III, [[Estates of Navarre|a representative assembly]], the clergy being represented by the bishops of Bayonne and [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], their vicars-general, the parish priest of [[St-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], and the priors of [[Saint-Palais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], Utziat and Harambels (Haranbeltz).\n\n[[Jeanne d'Albret|Jeanne III]] converted to [[Calvinism]] in 1560, and thereupon commissioned a translation of the [[New Testament]] into Basque; one of the first books published in this language. Jeanne also declared Calvinism to be the official religion of Navarre.<ref>G.R. Evans, ''The Roots of the Reformation: Tradition, Emergence and Rupture'', (InterVarsity Press, 2012), 326.</ref> She and her son, [[Henry IV of France|Henry III]], led the [[Huguenot]] party in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. In 1589, Henry became the sole rightful claimant to the crown of France, though he was not recognized as such by many of his subjects until his conversion to [[Catholicism]] four years later.\n\nWhen [[Labourd]] and Upper Navarre were shaken by the [[Basque witch trials]] between 1609 and 1613, many sought refuge in Lower Navarre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The last independent king of Navarre, Henry III (reigned 1572\u20131610), succeeded to the throne of France as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1589, founding the [[Bourbon dynasty]]. Between 1620 and 1624, Lower Navarre and B\u00e9arn were incorporated into France proper by Henry's son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII of France (Louis II of Navarre)]]. The [[Parliament of Navarre and B\u00e9arn|Parliament of Navarre]], seated at Pau, was also created by merging the Royal [[Council of Navarre]] and the sovereign [[Council of B\u00e9arn]].\n\nThe 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] put an end to the litigation over the definite French-Spanish borders and to any French-Navarrese dynastic claim over Spanish Navarre. The title of King of Navarre continued to be used by the Kings of France until the [[French Revolution]] in 1792, and was revived again during the [[French Restoration|Restoration]], 1814\u201330. Since the rest of Navarre was in Spanish hands, the kings of Spain would also use the title of King of Navarre, and continue to do so. During the [[Estates General of 1789|1789 Estates-General]], the [[Estates of Navarre]] sent [[\u00c9tienne Polverel]] to Paris to defend the idiosyncrasy and independence of Navarre in the face of the planned homogenizing administrative layout of France.\n\n==The crown and the kingdom: A constitutional foundation==\n{{Further|Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros}}\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of Spain (1580-1668) - Navarre.svg|thumb|right|Spanish royal coat of arms variant of Spain used in Navarre, [[House of Habsburg]] (1580\u20131668)]]\nAs the Kingdom of Navarre was originally organized, it was divided into ''[[merindad]]es'', districts governed by a ''merino'' (\"mayorino\", a sheriff), the representative of the king.<ref name=EB1911/> They were the \"Ultrapuertos\" (French Navarre), Pamplona, Estella, [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] and Sang\u00fcesa. In 1407 the ''merindad'' of Olite was added. The [[Parliament|Cortes]] of Navarre began as the king's council of churchmen and nobles, but in the course of the 14th century the burgesses were added.<ref name=EB1911/> Their presence was due to the fact that the king had need of their co-operation to raise money by grants and aids, a development that was being paralleled in England.\n\nThe Cortes henceforth consisted of the churchmen, the nobles and the representatives of twenty-seven (later thirty-eight) \"good towns\"\u2014towns which were free of a feudal lord, and, therefore, held directly by the king.<ref name=EB1911/>  The independence of the burgesses was better secured in Navarre than in other parliaments of Spain by the constitutional rule which required the consent of a majority of ''each order'' to every act of the Cortes.<ref name=EB1911/> Thus the burgesses could not be outvoted by the nobles and the Church,<ref name=EB1911/> as they could be elsewhere. Even in the 18th century the Navarrese successfully resisted Bourbon attempts to establish custom houses on the French frontier,<ref name=EB1911/> dividing French from Spanish Navarre.\n\nThe institutions of Navarre which maintained their autonomy until the 19th century included the Cortes (''The Three States'', precursor to the [[Parliament of Navarre]]), Royal Council, Supreme Court and ''Diputacion del Reino''. Similar institutions existed in the [[Crown of Aragon]] (in Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia) until the 18th century. The Spanish monarch was represented by a viceroy, who could object to the decisions made in the Navarrese context.\n\nDuring that period Navarre enjoyed a special status within the Spanish monarchy; it had its own [[parliament|cortes]], taxation system, and separate customs laws.\n\n==Later history and the end of the ''fueros''==\n{{Further|End of Basque home rule in Spain}}\nBy the [[War of the Pyrenees]] and the [[Peninsular War]], Navarre was in a deep crisis over the Spanish royal authority, involving the Spanish prime minister [[Manuel Godoy]], who bitterly opposed the Basque charters and their autonomy, and maintained high duty exactions on the Ebro customs against the Navarrese, and the Basques as a whole. The only way out the Navarrese found was an increased trade with France, which in turn spurred the importation of bourgeois, modern ideas. However, the progressive, enlightened bourgeois circles strong in Pamplona\u2014and other Basque towns and cities like [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia]]\u2014were eventually quelled during the above wars.\n\nAfter the French defeat, the only source of support for Navarrese self-government was [[Ferdinand VII]]. The king wielded the flag of the [[ancient r\u00e9gime]], as opposed to the liberal [[Constitution of C\u00e1diz]] (1812), which ignored the Navarrese and Basque ''fueros'' and any different identities in Spain, or the \"Spains\", as it was considered before the 19th century.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic wars, many in Navarre took to the bush to avoid tax exactions and the military abuses over property and people during their expeditions, be they French, English, or Spanish. These parties sowed the seeds of the later militias of the [[Carlist Wars]] acting under different banners, Carlists most often, but also pro-''fueros'' liberals. However, once the local, urban based enlightened bourgeois were suppressed by the Spanish authorities and bristled at despotic French rule during the occupation, the most staunchly Catholic rose to prominence in Navarre, coming under strong clerical influence.\n\nThis, and the resentment felt at the loss of their autonomy when they were incorporated into Spain in 1833{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, account for the strong support given by many Navarrese to the [[Carlist]] cause.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1833, Navarre and the whole [[Basque people|Basque]] region in Spain became the chief stronghold of the Carlists, but in 1837 a Spanish Liberal, centralist constitution was proclaimed in Madrid, and [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] recognized as queen. Following the [[Convention of Vergara|August 31, 1839, armistice]] putting an end to the [[First Carlist War]], Navarre remained in a shaky state.\n\nIts separate status was acknowledged on the Act promulgated in October that year, but after arrival of [[Baldomero Espartero]] and the anti-''fueros'' Progressives to office in Madrid, talks with Navarrese Liberal negotiators led to a near-assimilation of Navarre with the Spanish province. Navarre was not a kingdom any more, but another Spanish province. In exchange for giving up self-government, the Navarrese got the ''Compromise Act'' (the ''Ley Paccionada'') in 1841, a set of tax, administrative and other prerogatives, conjuring an idea of 'compromise between two equal sides', and not a granted charter.\n\n==Province of Spain==\n{{Main|Navarre#Province of Spain}}\nFollowing the 1839\u20131841 treaties, conflict with Madrid's central government over Navarre's agreed administrative and fiscal idiosyncrasies contributed to the [[Third Carlist War]] (1872-76), largely centred in the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque districts]]. Myriad parties and factions emerged in Navarre demanding different degrees of restoration of native institutions and laws. Catholicism and traditionalism became major driving forces behind Navarrese politics.\n\nThe Church in Navarre became a mainstay of the reactionary Spanish Nationalist uprising against the 2nd Spanish Republic (1936). The figure of progressives and inconvenient dissidents exterminated across Navarre is estimated at around 3,000 in the period immediately after the successful military uprising (July 1936). As a reward for its support in the [[Spanish Civil War]], Franco allowed Navarre, as it happened with \u00c1lava, to maintain [[Fueros of Navarre|some prerogatives]] reminiscent of the ancient Navarrese liberties. Navarre's specific status during Franco's regime led to the present-day Chartered Community of Navarre during the Spanish transition to democracy (the so-called ''Amejoramiento'', 1982).\n\n==Territory today==\nThe territory formerly known as Navarre now belongs to two nations, Spain and France, depending on whether it lies south or north of the Western Pyrenees.  The Basque language is still spoken in most of the provinces. Today, [[Navarre]] is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community of Spain]] and [[Lower Navarre|Basse-Navarre]] is part of France's [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] [[d\u00e9partement]].

The city of Pamplona ({{lang-la|Pompaelo}}; {{lang-eu|Iru\u00f1ea}}), had been the main city of the indigenous [[Vascones|Vasconic]] population and was located amid a predominantly Basque-speaking area.<ref>{{cite book |last=Trask |first=Robert.L. |date=1996 |title=The History of Basque |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUDaAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA427&lpg=PA427&dq=trask+basque+kingdom+of+navarre&source=bl&ots=X4PaSvGC-6&sig=dDFFsR1yXXTzSFrqx9DkCmk8OWM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMIg6Lcm9nExwIVwrYUCh36yQ0Y#v=onepage&q=trask%20basque%20kingdom%20of%20navarre&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=427|isbn= 0-415-13116-2}}</ref><ref>Collins, R. 1989, p. 159</ref>  In an event traditionally dated to 824, [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista of Pamplona|\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista]] was elected or declared ruler of the area around Pamplona in opposition to [[Francia|Frankish expansion]] into the region, originally as vassal to the C\u00f3rdoba Emirate.  This polity evolved into the Kingdom of Pamplona. In the first quarter of the 10th century the Kingdom was able to briefly break its vassalage under C\u00f3rdoba and expand militarily, but again found itself dominated by C\u00f3rdoba until the early 11th century.  A series of partitions and dynastic changes led to a diminution of its territory and to periods of rule by the kings of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] (1054\u20131134) and [[Kingdom of France|France]] (1285\u20131328).\n\nIn the 15th century, another dynastic dispute over control by the king of Aragon led to internal divisions and the eventual conquest of the southern part of the kingdom by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1512 (permanently in 1524). It was annexed by the Courts of Castile to the Crown of Castile in 1515. The remaining northern part of the kingdom was again joined with France by [[personal union]] in 1589 when King Henry III of Navarre inherited the French throne as [[Henry IV of France]], and in 1620 it was merged into the [[Kingdom of France]]. The monarchs of this unified state took the title \"King of France and Navarre\" until its fall in the [[French Revolution]], and again during the [[Bourbon Restoration]] from 1814 until 1830 (with a [[Hundred Days|brief interregnum in 1815]]).\n\nToday, significant parts of the ancient Kingdom of Navarre comprise the Spanish [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Navarre]], {{lang|es|[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma Vasca]]}} and {{lang|es|[[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]}} and the French community of {{lang|fr|[[Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Pays Basque|Pays Basque]]}}.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are similar earlier toponyms but the first documentation<ref name=\"Au\u00f1amendi\">[[Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa]]'s Spanish article on  [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/96788 Navarra] in the [[Au\u00f1amendi Entziklopedia]] (click on \"NAVARRA \u2013 NAFARROA (NOMBRE Y EMBLEMAS)\")</ref> of Latin {{lang|la|navarros}} appears in [[Eginhard]]'s chronicle of the feats of [[Charles the Great]].\nOther [[Royal Frankish Annals]] give ''nabarros''.\nThere are two proposed etymologies<ref name=\"Au\u00f1amendi\"/> for the name of {{lang|es|Navarra}}/{{lang|eu|Nafarroa}}/{{lang|eu|Naparroa}}:\n\n* Basque {{lang|eu|nabar}} (declined [[absolutive case|absolute]] [[grammatical number|singular]] {{lang|eu|nabarra}}): \"brownish\", \"multicolor\", which would be a contrast with the green mountain lands north of the original County of Navarre.\n* Basque {{lang|eu|naba}}, Castilian {{lang|es|nava}} (\"valley\", \"plain\", present across Spain) + Basque {{lang|eu|herri}} (\"people\", \"land\").\n\nThe linguist [[Joan Coromines]] considers ''naba'' as not clearly Basque in origin but as part of a wider [[Aquitanian language|pre-Roman]] substrate.\n\n==Early historic background==\n{{see also|Duchy of Vasconia}}\n\n[[File:Aquitani tribes map-fr.svg|thumb|left|250px|Tribes of the western Pyrenees.]]\nThe kingdom originated in the southern side of the western Pyrenees, in the flatlands around the city of [[Pamplona]].  According to Roman geographers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Livy]], these regions were inhabited by the [[Vascones]] and other related Vasconic-[[Aquitani]]an tribes, a pre-[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] group of peoples who inhabited the southern slopes of the western Pyrenees and part of the shore of the [[Bay of Biscay]].<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Navarre |volume=19 |pages=281\u2013282}}</ref> These tribes spoke an archaic version of the [[Basque language]], usually known by linguistics as [[Proto-Basque language|Proto-Basque]], as well as some other related languages, such as the [[Aquitanian language]].  The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took full control of the area by 74 BC, but unlike their northern neighbors, the Aquitanians, and other tribes from the Iberian Peninsula, the Vascones negotiated their status within the Roman Empire.{{Sfn|Collins|1990|pp=53\u201356}}  The region first was part of the Roman province of [[Hispania Citerior]], then of the [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. It would be under the jurisdiction of the {{lang|la|[[conventus iuridicus]]}} of Caesaraugusta (modern [[Zaragoza]]).\n\nThe Roman empire influenced the area in urbanization, language, infrastructure, commerce, and industry.  During the [[Sertorian War]], [[Pompey]] would command the foundation of a city in Vasconic territory, giving origin to ''Pompaelo'', modern-day Pamplona, founded on a previously existent Vasconic town. [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of the Vascones led to their eventual adoption of forms of [[Latin]] that would evolve into the [[Navarro-Aragonese]] language, though the Basque language would remain widely spoken, especially in rural and mountainous areas.\n\nAfter the decline of the Western Roman Empire, the Vascones were slow to be incorporated into the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which was in a civil war that provided the opportunity for the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. The Basque leadership probably joined in the appeal that, in the hope of stability, brought the Muslim conquerors. By 718, Pamplona had formed a pact that allowed a wide degree of autonomy in exchange for military and political subjugation, along with the payment of tribute to [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|C\u00f3rdoba]].{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=277}}  Burial ornamentation shows strong contacts with the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] France and the Gascons of [[Aquitaine]], but also items with [[Islam]]ic inscriptions, while a Muslim cemetery in Pamplona, the use of which spanned several generations, suggests the presence of a Muslim garrison in the decades following the [[Arab]] invasion.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\nThe origin and foundation of the Kingdom of Pamplona is intrinsically related to the southern expansion of the [[Francia|Frankish kingdom]] under the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] and their successors, the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]]. About 601, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] ({{lang-la|Wasconiae}}) was established by the Merovingians, based around Roman [[Novempopulania]] and extending from the southern branch of the river [[Garonne]] to the northern side of the [[Pyrenees]]. The first documented Duke of Vasconia was [[Genial]], who would hold that position until 627.\n\nThe Duchy of Vasconia then became a frontier territory with varying levels of autonomy granted by the Merovingian monarchs. The suppression of the Duchy of Vasconia as well as the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] by the Carolingians would lead to a rebellion, led by [[Lupo II of Gascony]]. [[Pepin the Short]] launched a punitive [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|War in Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768) that put down the uprising and resulted in the division of the Duchy into several counties, ruled from [[Toulouse]]. Similarly, across the eastern Pyrenees the [[Marca Hisp\u00e1nica]] was established next to the [[Septimania|Marca Gothica]], a Frankish attempt at creating [[buffer state]]s between the [[Carolingian empire]] and the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]].\n\nThe Franks under Charlemagne extended their influence and control southward, occupying several regions of the north and east of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is unclear how solidly the Franks exercised control over Pamplona. In 778, Charlemagne was invited by rebellious Muslim lords on the [[Upper March]] of [[Al-Andalus]] to lead an expedition south with the intention of taking the city of [[Zaragoza]] from the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. However, the expedition was a failure, and the Frankish army was forced to withdraw. During their retreat, they destroyed the city walls of Pamplona to weaken the city and avoid a possible rebellion,{{Sfn|Jimeno Jur\u00edo|2004|p=}} reminiscent of the approach the Carolingians had used elsewhere against Christian cities that seemed content to live under C\u00f3rdoban control.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=280}}\n\nHowever, while moving through the Pyrenees on 15 August 778, the rearguard of the Frankish army, led by [[Roland]] was attacked by the Basque tribes in a confrontation that came to be known as the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. [[Roland]] was killed and the rearguard scattered. As a response to the attempted Frankish seizure of Zaragoza, the C\u00f3rdoban emir retook the city of Pamplona and its surrounding lands. In 781 two local Basque lords, ''Ibn Balask'' (\"son of Velasco\"), and ''Mothmin al-Akra'' (\"Jimeno ''the Strong''\") were defeated and forced to submit.  The next mention of Pamplona is in 799, when Mutarrif ibn Musa, thought to have been a governor of the city and a member of the [[Muladi|muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] family, was killed there by a pro-Frankish faction.\n\nDuring this period, Basque territory extended on the west to somewhere around the headwaters of the [[Ebro]] river.{{sfn|Collins|1989|p=159}} Equally [[Einhart]]'s ''Vita Karoli Magni'' pinpoints the source of the Ebro in the land of the Navarrese.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ein.html In the 15th paragraph], the Carolingian chronicler states, \"ipse per bella memorata primo Aquitaniam et Wasconiam totumque Pyrinei montis iugum et usque ad Hiberum amnem, qui apud Navarros ortus et fertilissimos Hispaniae agros secans\".</ref> However, this western region fell under the influence of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].\n\n[[File:Pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica 814.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Duchy of Vasconia]] in 814.]]\n\nThe Franks renewed their attempts to control the region and in 806 took Navarre under their protection. Following a truce between the Frankish kingdom and C\u00f3rdoba, in 812 [[Louis the Pious]] went to Pamplona, likely to establish there a county that would prove short-lived.  However, continued rebellion in Gascony rendered Frankish control south of the Pyrenees tenuous,{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=281}} and the Emirate was able to reclaim the region following victory in the 816 [[Battle of Pancorbo (816)|Battle of Pancorbo]], in which they defeated and killed the \"enemy of Allah\", ''Balask al-Yalaski'' (Velasco the Gascon), along with the uncle of [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], Garcia ibn Lubb ('son of Lupus'), Sancho, the 'premier knight of Pamplona', and the pagan warrior ''\u1e62alt\u0101n''. North of the Pyrenees in the same year, Louis the Pious removed [[Seguin I of Gascony |Seguin]] as Duke of Vasconia, which initiated a rebellion,<ref>\"Louis the Pious\", Rene Poupardin, ''The Cambridge Medieval History: Germany and the Western Empire'', Vol. III, ed. J.B.Bury, (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 8.</ref>\nled by [[Garc\u00eda I Jim\u00e9nez of Gascony|Garcia Jim\u00e9nez]], who was killed in 818. Louis's son [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], then King of Aquitaine, stamped out the Vasconic revolt in [[Gascony]] then hunted the chieftains who had taken refuge in southern Vasconia, i.e., Pamplona and Navarre, no longer controlled by the Franks. He sent an army led by the counts [[Aeblus]] and [[Aznar Sanchez of Gascony|Aznar Sanchez]] (the latter being appointed lord, but not duke, of Vasconia by Pepin after suppressing the uprising in the Duchy), accomplishing their goals with no resistance in Pamplona (which still lacked walls after the 778 destruction). On the way back, however, [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824) |they were ambushed and defeated]] in Roncevaux by a force probably composed both of Basques and the C\u00f3rdoba-allied muwallad [[Banu Qasi]].\n\n==Nascent state and kingdom==\n\n===Establishment by I\u00f1igo Arista===\n\nOut of the pattern of competing Frankish and C\u00f3rdoban interests, the Basque chieftain [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista of Pamplona|\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista]] took power.<ref>\"Du nouveau sur le royaume de Pampelune au IXe si\u00e8cle\", \u00c9variste L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al, ''Bulletin Hispanique'', 1953, Volume 55, Issue 55-1, page 11; \"''Mais, en ce qui concerne le roi vascon Inigo Iniguez...''\"</ref> Tradition tells he was elected as king of Pamplona in 824, giving rise to a dynasty of kings in Pamplona that would last for eighty years.  However, the region around Pamplona continued to fall within the sphere of influence of C\u00f3rdoba, presumably as part of its broader frontier region, the [[Upper March]], ruled by \u00cd\u00f1igo's half-brother, [[Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi]]. The city was allowed to remain [[Christianity|Christian]] and have its own administration but had to pay the traditional taxes to the Emirate,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=324}} including the ''[[jizya]]'' assessed on non-Muslims living under their control.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=284}} \u00cd\u00f1igo Arista is mentioned in Arab records as ''s\u00e2hib'' (lord) or ''am\u00eer'' of the Vascones (''bashkunish'') and not as ''malik'' (king) or ''t\u00e2giya'' (tyrant) used for the kings of Asturias and France, indicating the lower status of these ''ul\u00fbj'' (barbarians, not accepting Islam) within the C\u00f3rdoba sphere.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002 |p=404}}{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|p=281}} In 841, in concert with Musa ibn Musa, \u00cd\u00f1igo rebelled and though Musa was eventually forced to submit, \u00cd\u00f1igo was still in rebellion at the time of his death in 851/2.\n\nPamplona and Navarre are distinguished in Carolingian chronicles. Pamplona is cited in 778 as a Navarrese stronghold, while this may be put down to their vague knowledge of the Basque territory. They distinguished Navarre and its main town in 806 though (''\"In Hispania, vero Navarrensis et Pampelonensis\"''), while the ''Chronicle of Fontenelle'' refers to \"''Induonis et Mitionis, ducum Navarrorum''\" (Induo [\u00cd\u00f1igo Arista] and Mitio [perhaps Jimeno], dukes of the Navarrese). However, Arab chroniclers make no such distinctions, and just refer to the ''Baskunisi'', a transliteration of ''[[Vascones]]'',{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=135}} since a big majority of the population was Basque.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=140}}<ref>{{cite book | author = Trask, R.L.| year = 1997 | title= The History of Basque | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lbLbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 | location=New York, USA | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-13116-2 | page = 14}}</ref> The primitive Navarre may have comprised the valleys of Go\u00f1i, Gesalaz, Lana, Allin, Deierri, Berrueza and Ma\u00f1eru, which later formed the ''merindad'' of Estella.\n\nThe role of Pamplona as a focus coordinating both rebellion against and accommodation with C\u00f3rdoba seen under \u00cd\u00f1igo would continue under his son, [[Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez]] (851/2\u2013882), who formed alliances with Asturias, Gascons, Aragonese and with families in Zaragoza opposed to Musa ibn Musa.

Neither of these kings would make significant territorial expansion.  This period of a fractious, but in the end subservient, Navarre came to an end amidst a period when generalized rebellion within the Emirate prevented them from being able to suppress the inertial forces in the western Pyrenees.  The ineffectual Fort\u00fan was forced to abdicate in favor of a new dynasty from the vehemently anti-Muslim east of Navarre, the founders of which took a less accommodationist view. With this change, al-Andalus sources shift to calling the Pamplona rulers 'tyrants', as with the independent kings of Asturias: Pamplona had passed out of the C\u00f3rdoban sphere.{{sfn|Larrea|Lorenzo|2012|pp=284\u2013286}}\n\n===Jim\u00e9nez rule===\n\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 910-es.svg|thumb|right|The Kingdom of Pamplona (Navarra, orange) c. 910]]\n\nAfter taking the political power from Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s, [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho Garc\u00e9s]] (905\u2013925), son of Dadilde, sister of [[Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza]], proclaimed himself king,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=405}} terminating the alliance with the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba and expanding its domains through the course of the [[Ega (river)|River Ega]] all the way south to the [[Ebro]] and taking the regions of [[N\u00e1jera]] and [[Calahorra]], which caused the decline of the [[Banu Qasi]] family, who ruled these lands. As a response, [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] undertook two expeditions to these lands, earning a victory at the [[Battle of Valdejunquera]], after which the Emirate retook the lands south of the river [[Ebro]], and by 924 attacked Pamplona. The daughter of Sancho Garc\u00e9s, Sancha, was married to the [[Kingdom of Leon|King of Leon]] [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]], establishing an alliance with the Leonese kingdom and ensuring the Calahorra region.

He was a man of unbreakable devotion to the faith of Christ, pious with all the faithful and merciful with oppressed Catholics. What more? In all his actions he performed as a great warrior against the people of the [[Muslims|Ismailites]]; he inflicted multiple disasters on the Saracens. This same captured all the fortified places in the [[Duchy of Cantabria|Cantabria]], from the city of [[N\u00e1jera]] to [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]]. Indeed he possessed all the land of Degium [Monjard\u00edn, near [[Estella-Lizarra|Lizarra]]] with its towns. The \"Arba\" of Pamplona he submitted to his law, and conquered as well all the country of [[Aragon]] [then [[Jaca]] and nearby lands] with its fortresses.

Buried in the portal of Saint Stephen [Monjard\u00edn], he reigns with Christ in Heaven (King Sancho Garc\u00e9s died in the era 964 [925]).}}\n\nAfter the death of Sancho Garc\u00e9s, the crown passed to his brother, [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona|Jimeno Garc\u00e9s]] (925\u2013931), joined by Sancho's underage son, [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez]] (931\u2013970), in his last year.  Garc\u00eda continued to rule under the tutelage of his mother, Sancho's widow Toda Aznarez, who also engineered several political marriages with the other Christian kingdoms and counties of northern Iberia.  Oneca was married to [[Alfonso IV of Le\u00f3n]] and her sister [[Urraca S\u00e1nchez of Pamplona|Urraca]] to [[Ramiro II of Le\u00f3n]], while other daughters of Sancho were married to counts of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[County of \u00c1lava|\u00c1lava]] and [[County of Bigorre|Bigorre]]. The marriage of the Pamplonese king Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez with [[Andregoto Gal\u00edndez]], daughter of [[Galindo Azn\u00e1rez II]], [[County of Aragon|Count of Aragon]] linked the eastern county to the Kingdom.  In 934, he invited [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] to intervene in the kingdom in order to emancipate himself from his mother, and this began a period of tributary status by Pamplona and frequent punitive campaigns from C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nGarc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez's heir, [[Sancho II of Pamplona|Sancho II]] (970\u2013994), set up his half brother, [[Ramiro Garc\u00e9s of Viguera]], to rule in the short-lived Kingdom of Viguera. The ''Historia General de Navarra'' by [[Jaime del Burgo]] says that on the occasion of the donation of the [[villa]] of Alastue by the king of Pamplona to the monastery of [[San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]] in 987, he styled himself \"King of Navarre\", the first time that title had been used. In many places he appears as the first King of Navarre and in others the third; however, he was at least the seventh [[king of Pamplona]].\n\nDuring the late 10th century, [[Almanzor]], the ruler of [[Al Andalus]], frequently led raids against the Christian kingdoms, and attacked the Pamplonese lands on at least nine occasions. In 966, clashes between the Islamic factions and the Kingdom resulted in the loss of Calahorra and the valley of the [[Cidacos|river Cidacos]]. Sancho II, while allied with Castilian militias, suffered a grave defeat in the Battle of Torrevicente. Sancho II was forced to hand over one of his daughters and one of his sons as tokens of peace. After the death of Sancho II and during the reign of [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II]], Pamplona was attacked by the Caliphate on several occasions, being completely destroyed in 999,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=407}} the King himself killed during a raid in the year 1000.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|1993|pp=73\u201378}}\n\nAfter the death of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II, the crown passed to [[Sancho III of Navarre|Sancho III]], just eight years old at the time, and probably completely controlled by the Caliphate.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|1993|p=78}} During the first years of his reign the Kingdom was ruled by his cousins Sancho and Garc\u00eda of Viguera until the year 1004, when Sancho III would become ruling king, mentored by his mother Jimena Fern\u00e1ndez. The links with Castile became stronger through marriages. The death of Almanzor in 1002 and his successor [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] in 1008 caused the decline of the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the progress of the [[Kingdom of Castile|County of Castile]] south, while Pamplona, led by Sancho Garc\u00e9s III, strengthen the position of his kingdom on the borderlands of the [[Taifa of Zaragoza]], controlling the territories of [[Loarre]], [[Funes, Navarra|Funes]], [[Sos del Rey Cat\u00f3lico|Sos]], [[Uncastillo]], Arlas, [[Caparroso]] and [[Bolta\u00f1a]].{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=82}}{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=408}}\n\n[[File:Pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica 1000.svg|thumb|right|250px|The Kingdom of Pamplona (dark orange) in 1000.]]\n\nIn the year 1011 Sancho III married [[Muniadona of Castile]], daughter of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Count of Castile]] [[Sancho Garc\u00eda of Castile|Sancho Garc\u00eda]]. In 1016 the County of Castile and the Kingdom of Navarre made a pact on their future expansion: Pamplona would expand towards the south and east, the eastern region of [[Province of Soria|Soria]] and the [[Ebro]] valley, including territories that were at the time part of [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]].{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=83}} Thus, the Kingdom of Pamplona comprised a territory of 15,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 between Pamplona, N\u00e1jera and Arag\u00f3n with vassals of Pamplonese and Aragonese origin.{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p=408}}\n\nThe assassination of Count [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez of Castile]] in 1028 allowed Sancho to appoint his younger son Ferdinand as count. He also exerted a protectorate over the [[Duchy of Gascony]]. He seized the country of the Pisuerga and the Cea, which belonged to the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], and marched armies to the heart of that kingdom, forcing king [[Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n]] to flee to a Galician refuge. Sancho thereby effectively ruled the north of Iberia from the boundaries of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to those of the count of Barcelona.\n\nBy the time of the death of Sancho III in 1035, the Kingdom had reached its greatest historical extent. Sancho III wrote a problematic will, in which he divided his territory into three kingdoms.\n\n===Ecclesiastical affairs===\nIn this period of independence, the ecclesiastical affairs of the country reached a high state of development.  Sancho the Great was brought up at [[Monastery of Leyre|Leyre]], which was also for a short time the capital of the [[Diocese of Pamplona]]. Beside this see, there existed the [[Bishopric of Oca]], which was united in 1079 to the [[Diocese of Burgos]]. In 1035 Sancho III re-established the [[See of Palencia]], which had been laid waste at the time of the Moorish invasion.  When, in 1045, the city of Calahorra was wrested from the Moors, under whose dominion it had been for more than three hundred years, a see was also founded there, which in the same year absorbed the [[Diocese of Najera]] and, in 1088, the [[Diocese of Alava]], the jurisdiction of which covered about the same ground as that of the present [[Diocese of Vitoria]]. The See of Pamplona owed its re-establishment to Sancho III, who for this purpose convened a synod at Leyre in 1022 and one at Pamplona in 1023. These synods likewise instituted a reform of ecclesiastical life, with the above-named convent as a centre.\n\n==Dismemberment==\n\n===Division of Sancho's domains===\n[[File:Kingdom of Pamplona (c.1000).gif|thumb|right|Domains of Sancho III ''the Great''<br>{{legend|red|Kingdom of Pamplona}}{{legend|#ff8000|other possessions}}{{legend|#ff80ff|direct influence}}]]\n\nAt its greatest extent the Kingdom of Navarre included all the modern Spanish province; the northern slope of the western Pyrenees the Spaniards called the ''ultra puertos'' (\"country beyond the mountain passes\") or French Navarre; the Basque provinces of Spain and France; the Bureba, the valley between the Basque mountains and the Montes de Oca to the north of [[Burgos]]; and the Rioja and Tarazona in the upper valley of the Ebro.<ref name=EB1911/> On his death, Sancho divided his possessions among his four sons. Sancho the Great's realm was never again united (until [[Ferdinand the Catholic]]): Castile was permanently joined to Leon, whereas Aragon enlarged its territory, joining Catalonia through a marriage.\n\nFollowing the traditional succession customs, the first-born son of Sancho III, [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III]], received the title and lands of the Kingdom of Pamplona, which included the territory of [[Pamplona]], [[N\u00e1jera]] and parts of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]]. The rest of the territory was given to his widow Muniadona to split among all the legitimate sons: thus Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III also received the territory to the northeast from the County of Castile ([[La Bureba]], [[Montes de Oca (comarca)|Montes de Oca]]) and the [[County of \u00c1lava]]. [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand]] received the rest of the [[County of Castile]] and the lands between the Pisuerga and the Cea. Another son of Sancho, [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]], received the counties of [[Sobrarbe]] and [[County of Ribagorza|Ribargoza]] as vassal of his eldest brother, Garc\u00eda.

Garc\u00eda had supported the armed conflict between Ferdinand and his brother-in-law [[Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n]], who was ultimately killed in the [[Battle of Tamar\u00f3n]] (1037). This allowed Ferdinand to unite his Castilian county with the new-won crown of Le\u00f3n as king Ferdinand I.  For several years a mutual collaboration between the two kingdoms took place. The relationship between Garc\u00eda and his step-brother Ramiro was better. The latter had acquired all of Aragon, Ribagorza and Sobrarbe on the sudden death of his brother Gonzalo, forming what would become the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].  Garc\u00eda and Ramiro's alliance with [[Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer]], the [[Count of Barcelona]], was effective to keep the Muslim [[Taifa of Zaragoza]] at bay. After the capture of [[Calahorra]] in 1044, a period peace followed on the southern border and trade was established with Zaragoza.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|pp=85-86}}\n\nThe relationship between Garc\u00eda and Ferdinand deteriorated with time, the two disputing the lands on the Pamplonese-Castilian border,{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p= 410}} and ended violently in September 1054 at the [[Battle of Atapuerca]], in which Garc\u00eda was killed, and Ferdinand took from Pamplona the lands in [[La Bureba]] and the [[Tir\u00f3n River]].{{Sfn|Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza|1993|p=106 }}\n\nGarc\u00eda was succeeded by [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]] (1054\u20131076) ''of Pe\u00f1al\u00e9n'', whom Ferdinand had recognised as king of Pamplona immediately after the death of his father.  He was fourteen years old at the time, and under the regency of his mother Estefan\u00eda and his uncles Ferdinand and Ramiro.  After the death of his mother in 1058, Sancho IV lost the support of the local nobility, and the relations between them worsened after he became allied with [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir]], ruler of Zaragoza.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=86}} On 4 June 1076, a conspiracy involving Sancho IV's brother Ram\u00f3n and sister Ermesinda ended with the murder of the king. The neighboring kingdoms and the nobility probably had a part in the plot.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=87}}\n\nThe dynastic crisis resulting from Sancho's assassination worked to the benefit of the Castilian and Aragonese monarchs. [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] took control of [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], the [[Lordship of Biscay]], the [[County of \u00c1lava]], the [[County of Durango]] and part of [[Gipuzkoa]].{{Sfn|Mart\u00edn Duque|2002|p= 411}} [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]], successor to his father, Ramiro of Aragon, took control of the rest of the territory and was recognised as king by the Pamplonese nobility.{{Sfn|Miranda Garc\u00eda|1993|p=87}} The land around the city of Pamplona, the core of the original kingdom, became known as the County of Navarre, and was recognised by Alfonso VI as a vassal state of the kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Castile. Sancho Ram\u00edrez began in 1084 a renewed military expansion of the southern lands controlled by Muslim forces. That year, the city of [[Arguedas, Navarre|Arguedas]], from which the [[Bardenas Reales|Bardenas]] region could be controlled, was taken. After the death of Sancho Ram\u00edrez in 1094, he was succeeded by [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|Peter I]], who resumed the expansion of the territory, taking the cities of [[S\u00e1daba]] in 1096 and [[Milagro, Navarre|Milagro]] in 1098, while threatening [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]].{{Sfn|Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza|1993|p= 98 and 102}}\n\n[[Alfonso the Battler]] (1104\u20131134), brother of Peter I, secured for the country its greatest territorial expansion. He wrested [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] from the Moors (1114), re-conquered the entire country of Bureba, which Navarre had lost in 1042, and advanced into the current [[Province of Burgos]]. He also annexed [[Labourd]], with its strategic port of [[Bayonne]], but lost its coastal half to the English soon after. The remainder has been part of Navarre since then and eventually came to be known as [[Lower Navarre]].  Toward the south, he moved the Islamic border to the [[Ebro]] river, with [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], N\u00e1jera, [[Logro\u00f1o]], [[Calahorra]], and [[Alfaro, La Rioja|Alfaro]] added to his domain. \nIn 1118, the city of [[Zaragoza]] was taken by the Aragonese forces, and on 25 February 1119 the city of Tudela was taken and incorporated into Pamplona.{{Sfn|Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza|1993|p=104}}\n\nThe 1127 [[Peace of T\u00e1mara]] delimited the territorial domains of the Castilian and Aragonese realms, the latter including Pamplona. The lands of [[Lordship of Biscay|Biscay]], [[County of \u00c1lava|\u00c1lava]], [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Belorado]], [[Soria]] and [[San Esteban de Gormaz]] went back to the Pamplonese kingdom.{{Sfn|Serrano Izko|2006|p=125}}\n\n===Restoration and the loss of western Navarre===\n[[File:Reparto del reino de Navarra tras la muerte de Sancho IV El de Pe\u00f1al\u00e9n.svg|thumb|'''Division of the Kingdom of Pamplona after the death of Sancho Garc\u00e9s IV in 1076'''\n{{legend|#eeaaff|Area occupied by [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile]]}}\n{{legend|#ffaaaa|Area occupied by [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez|Sancho Ram\u00edrez of Aragon]]}}\n{{legend|#87de87|County of Navarre, vassal of Castile}}]]\n\nThe status quo between Aragon and Castile stood until the 1134 death of Alfonso. Being childless, he willed his realm to the military orders, particularly the [[Knights Templar|Templars]]. This decision was rejected by the courts (parliaments) of both Aragon and Navarre, which then chose separate kings.\n\n[[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], known as ''the Restorer'', is the first King of Navarre to use such a title. He was Lord of [[Monz\u00f3n]], a grandson of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, [[El Cid]], and a descendant by illegitimate line of king Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III. [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho Garcia]], known as Sancho VI \"the Wise\" (1150\u20131194), a patron of learning, as well as an accomplished statesman, fortified Navarre within and without, granted charters (fueros) to a number of towns, and was never defeated in battle. He was the first king to issue royal documents entitling him ''rex Navarrae'' or ''rex Navarrorum'', appealing to a wider power base, defined as politico-juridical by Urzainqui (a \"populus\"), beyond [[Pamplona]] and the customary ''rex Pampilonensium''.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=94}} As attested in the charters of San Sebasti\u00e1n and Vitoria-Gasteiz (1181), the natives are called ''Navarri'', as well as in another contemporary document at least, where those living to the north of [[Peralta, Navarre|Peralta]] are defined as Navarrese.<ref>But not the inhabitants of Peralta; the ''lingua navarrorum'' is attested as the Basque language.</ref>\n\n''The Restorer'' and [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho the Wise]] were faced with an ever-increasing intervention of Castile in Navarre. In 1170, [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] and [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], daughter of Henry II Plantagenet, married, with the Castilian king claiming [[Gascony]] as part of the dowry. It turned out a much needed pretext for the invasion of Navarre during the following years (1173\u20131176), with a special focus on Navarre's coastal districts, coveted by Castile in order to become a maritime power.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=111}} In 1177, the dispute was submitted to arbitration by [[Henry II of England]]. The Navarrese made their point on a number of claims, namely \"the proven will of the locals\" (''fide naturalium hominum suorum exhibita''), the assassination of the King [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho Garces IV of Navarre]] by the Castilians (''per violentiam fuit expulsus'', 1076), as well as law and custom, while the Castilians made their case by citing the Castilian takeover following the death of Sancho Garces IV, the dynastic links of Alfonso with Navarre, and the conquest of Toledo.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=152}} Henry did not dare issue a verdict based entirely on the legal grounds as presented by both sides, instead deciding to refer them back to the boundaries held by both kingdoms at the start of their reigns in 1158, besides agreeing to a truce of seven years. It thus confirmed the permanent loss of the Bureba and Rioja areas for the Navarrese.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=115}} However, soon, Castile breached the compromise, starting a renewed effort to harass Navarre both in the diplomatic and military arenas.{{sfn|Urzainqui|Olaizola|1998|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a 1190.jpg|thumb|Navarre (light green) in 1190]]\nThe rich dowry of [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]], daughter of [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI the Wise]] and Blanche of Castile, made her a desirable catch for [[Richard I of England]]. His aged mother, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], crossed the Pyrenean passes to escort Berengaria to Sicily, eventually to wed Richard in Cyprus, on 12 May 1191. She remains the only Queen of England who never set foot in England during her reign. The reign of Sancho the Wise's successor, the last king of the male line of Sancho the Great and the kings of Pamplona, Sancho VII the Strong (''Sancho el Fuerte'') (1194\u20131234), was more troubled. He appropriated the revenues of churches and convents, granting them instead important privileges; in 1198 he presented to the See of Pamplona his palaces and possessions there; this gift was confirmed by Pope Innocent III on 29 January 1199.\n\nIn 1199 Alfonso VIII of Castile, son of Sancho III of Castile and Blanche of Navarre, was determined to take over coastal Navarre, a strategic region that would allow Castile much easier access to European wool markets and would isolate Navarre as well. He launched a massive expedition against Navarre. [[Sancho VII of Navarre|Sancho the Strong]] was abroad in [[Tlemcen]] (modern Algeria) seeking support to counter the Castilian push, by opening a second front. [[Pope Celestine III]] intervened to frustrate the alliance.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza\n | first = Luis Javier\n | author-link = Stephen Bre...\n | title = La quiebra de la soberan\u00eda navarra en \u00c1lava, Guip\u00fazcoa y el Duranguesado (1199-1200)\n | journal = Euskomedia\n | volume = 45:2\n | pages = 470\u2013472\n | date = 2000 }}</ref>\n\nThe towns of [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]] and [[Trevi\u00f1o]] resisted the Castilian assault but the Bishop of Pamplona was sent to inform them that no reinforcements would arrive. After nine months of siege, Vitoria surrendered, but Trevi\u00f1o did not, having to be conquered by force of arms. By 1200 the conquest of western Navarre was complete. Castile allowed these territories (with the exceptions of Trevi\u00f1o and [[O\u00f1ati]], which were directly ruled from Castile) the right to keep their traditional customs and laws (''viz.'', Navarrese law), which came to be known as [[fueros]]. Alava was made a county, Biscay a [[Lord of Biscay|lordship]] and Gipuzkoa just a province. In 1207, an arrangement in Guadalajara between both kings sealed a 5-year truce over the occupied territories; still Castile kept a ''[[wikt:Fait accompli|fait accompli]]'' policy.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fort\u00fan P\u00e9rez de Ciriza \n | first = Luis Javier\n | author-link = Stephen Bre...\n | title = La quiebra de la soberan\u00eda navarra en \u00c1lava, Guip\u00fazcoa y el Duranguesado (1199-1200) \n | journal = Euskomedia\n | volume = 45:2\n | pages = 486\n | date = 2000 }}</ref>\n\nSancho the Strong would join in the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212), where he added his small force to the Christian alliance that was victorious over the Caliph [[Muhammad al-Nasir|Muhammand An-Nasir]]. He suffered from a varicose ulcer in his leg that led him to retire to Tudela, where he died in 1234. His elder sister Berengaria, Queen of England, had died childless some years earlier. His deceased younger sister Blanca, countess of Champagne, had left a son, [[Theobald IV of Champagne]]. Thus the Kingdom of Navarre, though the crown was still claimed by the kings of Aragon, passed by marriage<ref name=EB1911/> to the House of Champagne, firstly to the heirs of Blanca, who were simultaneously [[Counts of Champagne|counts of Champagne and Brie]], with the support of the Navarrese Parliament (''Cortes'').\n\n==Navarre in the Late Middle Ages==\n===Rule by Champagne and France===\n[[File:Arms of the Monarchs Navarre (1328-1425) with the Royal Crest.svg|thumb|Arms of the Monarchs of Navarre of the [[House of \u00c9vreux]] with the Royal Crest]]\n[[File:Trait\u00e9 de Bretigny.svg|thumbnail|220px|right|Navarre possessions in France 1360]]\n[[File:Map_France_1477-en_sovereign_B%C3%A9arn.png|thumb|right|280px|Map of France and the Pyrenees in 1477 showing the Kingdom of Navarre and the Principality of B\u00e9arn]]\nTheobald I made of his court a centre where the poetry of the troubadours that had developed at the court of the counts of Champagne was welcomed and fostered; his reign was peaceful. His son, [[Theobald II of Navarre|King Theobald II]] (1253\u201370), married [[Isabella of France, Queen of Navarre|Isabella]], daughter of King [[Louis IX of France]], and accompanied his saintly father-in-law upon his crusade to Tunis. On the homeward journey, he died at Trapani in Sicily, and was succeeded by his brother, [[Henry I of Navarre|King Henry I]], who had already assumed the reins of government during his absence, but ruled for only three years (1271\u201374). His daughter, [[Joan I of Navarre|Queen Joan I]], ascended as a minor and the country was once again invaded from all sides. The queen and her mother, [[Blanche of Artois]], sought refuge at the court of King [[Philip III of France]]. His son, the future King [[Philip IV of France]], had become engaged to the young sovereign and married her in 1284. From 1276, the time of the negotiations for this marriage, Navarre effectively passed into French control, though not without the French suppression of native resistance in the 1276-1277 War of the Navarreria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Navarre remained in personal union with the Kingdom of France until the death of [[Charles IV of France|King Charles I (Charles IV of France)]] in 1328. He was succeeded by his niece, [[Joan II of Navarre|Queen Joanna II]], daughter of [[Louis X of France|King Louis I (Louis X of France)]], and nephew-in-law, [[Philip III of Navarre|King Philip III]]. Joanna waived all claim to the throne of France and accepted as compensation for the counties of Champagne and Brie those of [[Angoumois|Angoul\u00eame]], [[County of Longueville|Longueville]], and [[List of Counts of Mortain|Mortain]].\n\nKing Philip III devoted himself to the improvement of the laws of the country, and joined King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] in battle against the Moors of 1343. After the death of his mother (1349), [[Charles II of Navarre|King Charles II]] assumed the reins of government (1349\u201387). He played an important part in the [[Hundred Years' War]] and in the French civil unrest of the time, and on account of his deceit and cruelty he received the ephithet of 'the Bad'. He gained and lost possessions in [[Normandy]] and, later in his reign, the [[Navarrese Company]] acquired island possessions in Greece.\n\nHis eldest son, on the other hand, [[Charles III of Navarre|King Charles III]], 'the Noble', once more returned the land to peaceful and happy government (1387\u20131425).  He reformed the government, built canals, and made the tributaries of the Ebro flowing through Navarre navigable.  As he outlived his legitimate sons, he was succeeded by his daughter, [[Blanche I of Navarre|Queen Blanche I]] (1425\u201342), and son-in-law, [[John II of Aragon|King John II]] (1397\u20131479).\n\n===Navarre under the Foix and Albret dynasties===\n{{further|Navarrese Civil War (1451\u20131455)}}\n\nAfter Queen [[Blanche I of Navarre]]'s death in 1441, Navarre was mired in continued disputes over royal succession. King John II was ruling in Aragon in the name of his brother, [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]. He left his son, [[Charles, Prince of Viana]], with merely the rank of governor, whereas Queen Blanche I had intended him to succeed her, as was the custom. In 1450, John II himself came back to Navarre, and, urged on by his ambitious second wife [[Juana Enriquez]], endeavoured to obtain the succession for their son [[Ferdinand the Catholic|Ferdinand]].\n\nMirroring inter-clan disputes during the bloody [[War of the Bands]] in the rest of the Basque territories, in 1451 Navarre split in two confederacies, the Agramonts and the Beaumonts, over royal succession, with ramifications both within and outside Navarre. In the violent [[Navarrese Civil War (1451\u20131455)|civil war]] that broke out, the Agramonts sided with [[John II of Aragon|John II]], and the Beaumonts \u2014 named after their leader, the chancellor, John of Beaumont \u2014 espoused the cause of [[Charles, Prince of Viana]].<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\">Monreal, G./Jimeno, R.</ref>{{rp|15}} The fights involved the high aristocracy and their junior branches, who carried on the feuds of their senior lines and thrived on weak, often absent, royal authority.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=104}}{{rp|252}}\n\nThe unhappy prince Charles was defeated by his father at [[Aibar]] in 1451, and held prisoner for two years, during which he wrote his famous ''Chronicle of Navarre'', a major source for the period. After his release, Charles sought the assistance of King [[Charles VII of France]] and his uncle Alfonso V (who resided in Naples), but in vain. In 1460 he was again imprisoned at the instigation of his stepmother, but the [[History of Catalonia#The Crown of Aragon|Catalans]] rose in revolt at this injustice, and he was again liberated and named governor of Catalonia. He died in 1461, poisoned by his stepmother [[Juana Enr\u00edquez]] without being able to retake the reins of Navarre. He had named as heir his next sister, [[Blanche II of Navarre|Queen Blanche II]], but she was immediately imprisoned by John II and died in 1464. While this episode of the civil war came to an end, it inaugurated a period of instability including on-off periods of struggle and uprisings all the way to the Spanish conquest (1512).\n\nOn Charles' demise in 1461, [[Eleanor of Navarre]], Countess of [[Foix]] and [[B\u00e9arn]], was proclaimed Princess of Viana, but the instability took a toll.  The south-western tip of Navarre--the Sonsierra ([[Oy\u00f3n-Oion|Oyon]], [[Laguardia, \u00c1lava|Laguardia]], in present-day [[\u00c1lava]]), and [[Los Arcos]]--was occupied by [[Henry IV of Castile]].  Castile's eventual annexation of this territory in 1463 was upheld by the French king Louis XI in Bayonne on 23 April 1463.<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\">Monreal, G./Jimeno, R.</ref>{{rp|15}}  John II continued to rule as king up to 1479, when Queen Eleanor succeeded him for only 15 days and then died; she left the crown to her grandson, [[Francis Phoebus of Navarre|Francis Phoebus]], but this inaugurated another period of instability. Eleanor's 13-year-old granddaughter [[Catherine I of Navarre]] succeeded her brother Francis Phoebus in accordance with his will (1483). As a minor she remained under the guardianship of her mother, [[Magdalena of Valois]], and was sought by Ferdinand the Catholic as a bride. However, another claimant to the throne was stubbornly trying to stop her, [[John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne]], brother-in-law of the future King [[Louis XII of France]]. Invoking the French [[Salic Law]], he called himself King of Navarre and sent diplomats to Ferdinand II.\n\nPressure built on Catherine's regent Magdalena of Valois who, intent on saving their French possessions, eventually decided to marry the young Queen to the 7-year-old [[John of Albret]], despite the Parliament of Navarre's preference for John of Aragon, son of Ferdinand and Isabella.<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\"/>{{rp|17}}  The Beaumont party rose up, while the Agramonts split over the marriage. Ferdinand II of Aragon in turn reconsidered his diplomatic policy on Navarre. The crown of Navarre fell back on their default policy of diplomacy, and signed the Treaty of Valencia on 21 March 1488, whereby trade was restored between Navarre and the Aragon-Castile tandem. Still, Ferdinand did not recognize Catherine and installed Castilian troops in Navarre, banning French troops in both the kingdom and the principality of B\u00e9arn.<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\"/>{{rp|17}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 0em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#99FF99; color:black; width:20em; max-width:30%\" cellspacing=\"5\" \n| align=\"left\"| \"''Before the sacrament of the holy unction is completed, this blessed coronation of yours, it is necessary for Your Royal Majesties to swear an oath to the people, as the monarchs of Navarre preceding you did formerly, so that the people can also swear an oath to you as set by custom [...] we swear [...] to the prelates, nobles [...] and men of the cities and good towns and all the people of Navarre [...] from all across the Kingdom of Navarre [...] all the ''fueros'', as well as the mores, and customs, tax exemptions, liberties, privileges held by each of you&mdash;either here or absent.''\"\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Instructions to the monarchs Catherine and John III on the mandatory oath owed to the Kingdom of Navarre, and the oath itself, ahead of their coronation (1494).\n|}\nFerdinand also pushed for the introduction of the coercive cross-border tribunal, the [[Inquisition]], which the Navarrese hated, but, under pressure from the Aragonese monarch, the doors of Navarre (Tudela) finally opened to the Church institution between 1486 and 1488, pushed by the Aragonese monarch's threats. Still, in 1510 the authorities of Tudela decreed the expulsion of the monk \"calling himself inquisitor.\"  Catherine and John III also lacked French royal support: both [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and [[Louis XII of France]] pushed hard to have John of Foix declared king.  Finally, following a short period of peace with Ferdinand after a treaty was signed, in January 1494 the coronation of the royal family took place in Pamplona. The monarchs Catherine I and John III swore an oath to respect the liberties of Navarre, and the proclamation was celebrated with a week-long festival, while the ceremony was not attended by the Aragonese bishops with jurisdiction in Navarre. During this period, the realm of Navarre-Be\u00e1rn was defined by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]]'s diplomat M\u00fcntzer as a nation like Switzerland.<ref name=\"ConqNavRef\">Urzainqui, T./Esarte, P./Et al.</ref>{{rp|16}}  In the same treaty, Ferdinand renounced war on Navarre or [[B\u00e9arn]] from Castile, but the attempt to restore royal authority and patrimony met with the resistance of the defiant count of Lerin, Louis of Beaumont, whose estates were confiscated.\n\nCatherine and John III's guardian Magdalena of Valois died in 1495 and John's father [[Alain I of Albret]] signed another treaty with Ferdinand, whereby the count of Ler\u00edn should abandon Navarre, receiving in compensation real estate and various enclaves in the recently conquered Granada. In exchange, Alain made an array of painful concessions: Ferdinand received the count of Ler\u00edn's patrimony and gained control of important fortresses across Navarre, including the right to keep a garrison in [[Olite]] at the heart of the kingdom. Also, Queen Catherine's 1-year-old daughter Magdalena was to be sent to Castile to be raised, with a plan on a future marriage &mdash; she would die young in Castile (1504).<ref name=\"ConqNavarre\"/>{{rp|18\u201319}} Following developments in France, the whole treaty was reverted in 1500 and another compromise was reached with Ferdinand, ensuring peace for another 4 years.\n\n===Spanish conquest===\n[[File:Madeleine_of_France,_bethroted_of_Ladislaus_the_Posthumous.jpg|thumb|upright|Magdalena of Valois, regent of Navarre from 1479 to 1494, and mother of Queen [[Catherine I of Navarre]]]]{{main|Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre}}\nIn spite of the treaties, Ferdinand the Catholic did not relinquish his long-cherished designs on Navarre. In 1506, the 53-year-old widower remarried, to [[Germaine of Foix]] (aged 16), daughter of Catherine's uncle John of Foix, who had attempted to claim Navarre over his under-age nephew and niece. However, their infant son died shortly after birth, ending hopes of a possible inheritance of Navarre. Ferdinand kept intervening directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of Navarre by means of the Beaumont party. In 1508, the Navarrese royal troops finally suppressed a rebellion of the count of Lerin after a long standoff. In a letter to the rebellious count, the king of Aragon insisted that while he may take over one stronghold or another, he should use \"''theft, deceit and bargain''\" instead of violence (23 July 1509).\n\nWhen Navarre refused to join one of many Holy Leagues against France and declared itself neutral, Ferdinand asked the Pope to excommunicate Albret, which would have legitimised an attack. The Pope was reluctant to label the Crown of Navarre as schismatic explicitly in a first bull against the French and the Navarrese (21 July 1512), but Ferdinand's pressure bore fruit when a (second) bull named Catherine and John III \"heretic\" (18 February 1513). On 18 July 1512, [[Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 2nd Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique de Toledo]] was sent to invade Navarre in the context of the second phase of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].\n\nUnable to face the powerful Castilian-Aragonese army, Jean d'Albret fled to B\u00e9arn (Orthez, [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Tarbes). Pamplona, Estella, Olite, Sanguesa, and Tudela were captured by September. The Agramont party sided with Queen Catherine while most, but not all, of the Beaumont party lords supported the occupiers. In October 1512, the legitimate King John III returned with an army recruited north of the Pyrenees and attacked Pamplona without success. By the end of December the Castilians were in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port.\n\nAfter this failure, the Navarrese ''Cortes'' (Parliament) had no option but pledge loyalty to King Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1513, the first Castilian viceroy took a formal oath to respect Navarrese institutions and law (''[[fueros]]'').  The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was extended into Navarre.  The Jews had already been forced into conversion or exile by the [[Alhambra Decree]] in Castile and Aragon, and now the Jewish community of Navarre and the Muslims of Tudela suffered its persecution.\n[[File:Jeanne d'Albret.JPG|thumb|upright|Jeanne III]]\n[[File:Polverel_Tableau_Navarre.png|thumb|upright|Defense of Navarre presented by Polverel (1789)]]\nThere were two more attempts at liberation in 1516 and 1521, both supported by popular rebellion, especially the second one. It was in 1521 that the Navarrese came closest to regaining their independence. As a liberation army commanded by [[Andr\u00e9 de Foix|General Asparros]] approached Pamplona, the citizens rose in revolt and besieged the military governor, [[Ignatius Loyola|I\u00f1igo de Loyola]], in his newly built castle. Tudela and other cities also declared their loyalty to the House of Albret.  While at first distracted due to only recently overcoming the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], the Navarrese-B\u00e9arnese army managed to liberate all the Kingdom, but shortly thereafter Asparros faced a large Castilian army at the [[Battle of Esquiroz|Battle of No\u00e1in]] on 30 June 1521. Asparros was captured, and the army completely defeated.\n\n===Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees===\nA small portion of Navarre north of the Pyrenees, [[Lower Navarre]], along with the neighbouring [[Viscounty of B\u00e9arn|Principality of B\u00e9arn]] survived as an independent kingdom which passed by inheritance. Navarre received from [[Henry II of Navarre|King Henry II]], the son of Queen Catherine and King John III, [[Estates of Navarre|a representative assembly]], the clergy being represented by the bishops of Bayonne and [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], their vicars-general, the parish priest of [[St-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], and the priors of [[Saint-Palais, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], Utziat and Harambels (Haranbeltz).\n\n[[Jeanne d'Albret|Jeanne III]] converted to [[Calvinism]] in 1560, and thereupon commissioned a translation of the [[New Testament]] into Basque; one of the first books published in this language. Jeanne also declared Calvinism to be the official religion of Navarre.<ref>G.R. Evans, ''The Roots of the Reformation: Tradition, Emergence and Rupture'', (InterVarsity Press, 2012), 326.</ref> She and her son, [[Henry IV of France|Henry III]], led the [[Huguenot]] party in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. In 1589, Henry became the sole rightful claimant to the crown of France, though he was not recognized as such by many of his subjects until his conversion to [[Catholicism]] four years later.\n\nWhen [[Labourd]] and Upper Navarre were shaken by the [[Basque witch trials]] between 1609 and 1613, many sought refuge in Lower Navarre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The last independent king of Navarre, Henry III (reigned 1572\u20131610), succeeded to the throne of France as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1589, founding the [[Bourbon dynasty]]. Between 1620 and 1624, Lower Navarre and B\u00e9arn were incorporated into France proper by Henry's son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII of France (Louis II of Navarre)]]. The [[Parliament of Navarre and B\u00e9arn|Parliament of Navarre]], seated at Pau, was also created by merging the Royal [[Council of Navarre]] and the sovereign [[Council of B\u00e9arn]].\n\nThe 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] put an end to the litigation over the definite French-Spanish borders and to any French-Navarrese dynastic claim over Spanish Navarre. The title of King of Navarre continued to be used by the Kings of France until the [[French Revolution]] in 1792, and was revived again during the [[French Restoration|Restoration]], 1814\u201330. Since the rest of Navarre was in Spanish hands, the kings of Spain would also use the title of King of Navarre, and continue to do so. During the [[Estates General of 1789|1789 Estates-General]], the [[Estates of Navarre]] sent [[\u00c9tienne Polverel]] to Paris to defend the idiosyncrasy and independence of Navarre in the face of the planned homogenizing administrative layout of France.\n\n==The crown and the kingdom: A constitutional foundation==\n{{Further|Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros}}\n[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of Spain (1580-1668) - Navarre.svg|thumb|right|Spanish royal coat of arms variant of Spain used in Navarre, [[House of Habsburg]] (1580\u20131668)]]\nAs the Kingdom of Navarre was originally organized, it was divided into ''[[merindad]]es'', districts governed by a ''merino'' (\"mayorino\", a sheriff), the representative of the king.<ref name=EB1911/> They were the \"Ultrapuertos\" (French Navarre), Pamplona, Estella, [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] and Sang\u00fcesa. In 1407 the ''merindad'' of Olite was added. The [[Parliament|Cortes]] of Navarre began as the king's council of churchmen and nobles, but in the course of the 14th century the burgesses were added.<ref name=EB1911/> Their presence was due to the fact that the king had need of their co-operation to raise money by grants and aids, a development that was being paralleled in England.\n\nThe Cortes henceforth consisted of the churchmen, the nobles and the representatives of twenty-seven (later thirty-eight) \"good towns\"\u2014towns which were free of a feudal lord, and, therefore, held directly by the king.<ref name=EB1911/>  The independence of the burgesses was better secured in Navarre than in other parliaments of Spain by the constitutional rule which required the consent of a majority of ''each order'' to every act of the Cortes.<ref name=EB1911/> Thus the burgesses could not be outvoted by the nobles and the Church,<ref name=EB1911/> as they could be elsewhere. Even in the 18th century the Navarrese successfully resisted Bourbon attempts to establish custom houses on the French frontier,<ref name=EB1911/> dividing French from Spanish Navarre.\n\nThe institutions of Navarre which maintained their autonomy until the 19th century included the Cortes (''The Three States'', precursor to the [[Parliament of Navarre]]), Royal Council, Supreme Court and ''Diputacion del Reino''. Similar institutions existed in the [[Crown of Aragon]] (in Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia) until the 18th century. The Spanish monarch was represented by a viceroy, who could object to the decisions made in the Navarrese context.\n\nDuring that period Navarre enjoyed a special status within the Spanish monarchy; it had its own [[parliament|cortes]], taxation system, and separate customs laws.\n\n==Later history and the end of the ''fueros''==\n{{Further|End of Basque home rule in Spain}}\nBy the [[War of the Pyrenees]] and the [[Peninsular War]], Navarre was in a deep crisis over the Spanish royal authority, involving the Spanish prime minister [[Manuel Godoy]], who bitterly opposed the Basque charters and their autonomy, and maintained high duty exactions on the Ebro customs against the Navarrese, and the Basques as a whole. The only way out the Navarrese found was an increased trade with France, which in turn spurred the importation of bourgeois, modern ideas. However, the progressive, enlightened bourgeois circles strong in Pamplona\u2014and other Basque towns and cities like [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia]]\u2014were eventually quelled during the above wars.\n\nAfter the French defeat, the only source of support for Navarrese self-government was [[Ferdinand VII]]. The king wielded the flag of the [[ancient r\u00e9gime]], as opposed to the liberal [[Constitution of C\u00e1diz]] (1812), which ignored the Navarrese and Basque ''fueros'' and any different identities in Spain, or the \"Spains\", as it was considered before the 19th century.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic wars, many in Navarre took to the bush to avoid tax exactions and the military abuses over property and people during their expeditions, be they French, English, or Spanish. These parties sowed the seeds of the later militias of the [[Carlist Wars]] acting under different banners, Carlists most often, but also pro-''fueros'' liberals. However, once the local, urban based enlightened bourgeois were suppressed by the Spanish authorities and bristled at despotic French rule during the occupation, the most staunchly Catholic rose to prominence in Navarre, coming under strong clerical influence.\n\nThis, and the resentment felt at the loss of their autonomy when they were incorporated into Spain in 1833{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, account for the strong support given by many Navarrese to the [[Carlist]] cause.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1833, Navarre and the whole [[Basque people|Basque]] region in Spain became the chief stronghold of the Carlists, but in 1837 a Spanish Liberal, centralist constitution was proclaimed in Madrid, and [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] recognized as queen. Following the [[Convention of Vergara|August 31, 1839, armistice]] putting an end to the [[First Carlist War]], Navarre remained in a shaky state.\n\nIts separate status was acknowledged on the Act promulgated in October that year, but after arrival of [[Baldomero Espartero]] and the anti-''fueros'' Progressives to office in Madrid, talks with Navarrese Liberal negotiators led to a near-assimilation of Navarre with the Spanish province. Navarre was not a kingdom any more, but another Spanish province. In exchange for giving up self-government, the Navarrese got the ''Compromise Act'' (the ''Ley Paccionada'') in 1841, a set of tax, administrative and other prerogatives, conjuring an idea of 'compromise between two equal sides', and not a granted charter.\n\n==Province of Spain==\n{{Main|Navarre#Province of Spain}}\nFollowing the 1839\u20131841 treaties, conflict with Madrid's central government over Navarre's agreed administrative and fiscal idiosyncrasies contributed to the [[Third Carlist War]] (1872-76), largely centred in the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque districts]]. Myriad parties and factions emerged in Navarre demanding different degrees of restoration of native institutions and laws. Catholicism and traditionalism became major driving forces behind Navarrese politics.\n\nThe Church in Navarre became a mainstay of the reactionary Spanish Nationalist uprising against the 2nd Spanish Republic (1936). The figure of progressives and inconvenient dissidents exterminated across Navarre is estimated at around 3,000 in the period immediately after the successful military uprising (July 1936). As a reward for its support in the [[Spanish Civil War]], Franco allowed Navarre, as it happened with \u00c1lava, to maintain [[Fueros of Navarre|some prerogatives]] reminiscent of the ancient Navarrese liberties. Navarre's specific status during Franco's regime led to the present-day Chartered Community of Navarre during the Spanish transition to democracy (the so-called ''Amejoramiento'', 1982).\n\n==Territory today==\nThe territory formerly known as Navarre now belongs to two nations, Spain and France, depending on whether it lies south or north of the Western Pyrenees.  The Basque language is still spoken in most of the provinces. Today, [[Navarre]] is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community of Spain]] and [[Lower Navarre|Basse-Navarre]] is part of France's [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] [[d\u00e9partement]]. Other former Navarrese territories belong now to several autonomous communities of Spain: [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country]], [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]], [[Aragon]], and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\n==Historical symbols==\n<gallery>\nFile:COA Navarre escarbuncles.svg|Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Navarre during [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]\nFile:Sign of Sancho VII of Navarre.svg|Sign of [[Sancho VII of Navarre]]\nFile:Seal of Sancho VII of Navarre.svg|Seal of Sancho VII of Navarre<br/><small>(Reverse)</small>\nFile:Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Navarre.svg|Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Navarre, 1234-1580\nFile:Former Royal Badge of Navarre.svg|Royal Badge of the Medieval Monarchs of Navarre\nFile:EstandNavarra.png|Standard of the Medieval Monarchs of Navarre since 1212\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* Chartered Community of [[Navarra|Navarre (modern)]]\n* [[List of Navarrese monarchs]]\n* [[Kings of Navarre family tree]]\n* [[Court officials of the Kingdom of Navarre]]\n* [[Basque Country (historical territory)]]\n* [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Basque and Pyrenean Fueros]]\n* [[History of the Basque people]]\n* [[Vascones]]\nHistoric languages of the Kingdom of Navarre (824\u20131841):\n* [[Basque language|Basque]], natural language in most of the realm except for the southern plains (Ribera), 824\u20131841\n* [[Navarro-Aragonese]], natural language along the Ebro, in the south-east, some boroughs, and status language, 10\u201315th century\n* [[Occitan language#Occitan in Spain|Occitan]], natural language in some boroughs, status language, 11\u201314th century\n* [[Castilian language]], natural language in southern and increasingly central areas and many urban centres substituting Basque, status language, 15th century-1841\n* [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]], written language in [[Lower Navarre]] and limited geographical and social contexts, 1305\u20131790\n* [[Andalusian Arabic|Arabic]], language of the [[Mud\u00e9jar|Muslim communities]] remaining in southern areas after [[Reconquista|the conquest of Tudela in 1118]], as well as [[Sunni Islam|Muslim]] liturgy language, 824\u201314th century and 824\u2013early 16th century respectively\n* [[French language|French]], status language increasingly replacing Gascon (B\u00e9arnese) in administration and politics, 1624\u20131790\n* [[Erromintxela language|Erromintxela]], language used by the native [[Romani people|Romani]] communities especially in hilly areas, 15th century-1841\n* [[Hebrew]], religious and written language in Jewish communities located in certain urban centres, 10th century-1512\n* [[Latin]], Christian Catholic liturgy language and formal language in written scripts increasingly replaced by other Romance languages, 824\u20131841\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Ariqita y Lasa, ''Colecci\u00f3n de documentos para la historia de Navarra'' (Pamplona, 1900)\n* [[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]]: \"Die Bedeutung der Sprache in Renaissance und Reformation und die Entstehung der baskischen Literatur im religi\u00f6sen und politischen Konfliktgebiet zwischen Spanien und Frankreich\" In: Wolfgang W.

She was operated by the Mississippi Shipping Company for the [[War Shipping Administration]] as a [[United States Merchant Marine]] ship.  She was a [[Maritime Commission]] design. Like other Liberty ships, she was 441 feet (134&nbsp;m) long and 56 feet (17&nbsp;m) wide, carried 9000 tons of cargo and had a top speed of 11 knots (20&nbsp;km/h).

To support the [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship) to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry_harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W.

She was operated by the Mississippi Shipping Company for the [[War Shipping Administration]] as a [[United States Merchant Marine]] ship.  She was a [[Maritime Commission]] design. Like other Liberty ships, she was 441 feet (134&nbsp;m) long and 56 feet (17&nbsp;m) wide, carried 9000 tons of cargo and had a top speed of 11 knots (20&nbsp;km/h).

To support the [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship) to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southhampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry_harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W.

Using a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] to disperse their light, [[William Huggins]] was one of the earliest astronomers to study the [[optical spectrum|optical spectra]] of astronomical objects.<ref name=Moore2007/>\n\nOn August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed [[Cat's Eye Nebula]].<ref name=Kwok1/> His observations of stars had shown that their spectra consisted of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of radiation with many [[absorption line|dark lines]] superimposed. He found that many nebulous objects such as the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. However, when Huggins looked at the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], he found a very different spectrum. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Cat's Eye Nebula and other similar objects showed a number of [[Emission spectrum|emission lines]].<ref name=Moore2007/> Brightest of these was at a wavelength of 500.7&nbsp;[[nanometre]]s, which did not correspond with a line of any known element.<ref name=Huggins1864>{{harvnb|Huggins|Miller|1864|pp=437\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAt first, it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named [[nebulium]]. A similar idea had led to the discovery of [[helium]] through analysis of the [[Sun]]'s spectrum in 1868.<ref name=Kwok1/> While helium was isolated on Earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the Sun, \"nebulium\" was not. In the early 20th century, [[Henry Norris Russell]] proposed that, rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7&nbsp;nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.<ref name=Kwok1/>\n\nPhysicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low densities, [[electron]]s can occupy [[excited state|excited]] [[Metastability|metastable]] [[energy level]]s in atoms and ions that would otherwise be de-excited by collisions that would occur at higher densities.<ref name=Bowen1927>{{harvnb|Bowen|1927|pp=295\u20137}}</ref> Electron transitions from these levels in [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ions ({{nowrap|O<sup>+</sup>}}, [[Doubly ionized oxygen|{{nowrap|O<sup>2+</sup>}}]] (a.k.a. O&nbsp;{{Smallcaps|iii}}), and {{nowrap|N<sup>+</sup>}}) give rise to the 500.7&nbsp;nm emission line and others.<ref name=Kwok1/> These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called ''[[forbidden line]]s''. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that nebulae were made of extremely rarefied gas.<ref name=Gurzadyan>{{harvnb|Gurzadyan|1997}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Potw1550a.tif|thumb|Planetary nebula [[NGC 3699]] is distinguished by an irregular mottled appearance and a dark rift.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Planetary Nebula Divided|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1550a/|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Central stars ===\n\nThe central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot.<ref name=\"Frankowskietal2009\" /> Only when a star has exhausted most of its nuclear fuel can it collapse to a small size. Planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of [[stellar evolution]]. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding. This led to the idea that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.<ref name=Kwok1/>\n\n=== Modern observations ===\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, technological improvements helped to further the study of planetary nebulae.<ref name=KwokJun2005>{{harvnb|Kwok|2005|pp=271\u20138}}</ref> [[Space telescope]]s allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth's atmosphere transmits.

This end phase causes a dramatic rise in stellar luminosity, where the released energy is distributed over a much larger surface area, which in fact causes the average surface temperature to be lower. In [[stellar evolution]] terms, stars undergoing such increases in luminosity are known as [[Asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic giant branch stars]] (AGB).<ref name=Harpaz6/> During this phase, the star can lose 50 to 70% of its total mass from its [[stellar wind]].<ref name=wood>{{cite journal\n | last1=Wood | first1=P.

When temperatures reach about 100&nbsp;million K, the available [[helium|helium nuclei]] fuse into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]], so that the star again resumes radiating energy, temporarily stopping the core's contraction. This new helium burning phase (fusion of helium nuclei) forms a growing inner core of inert carbon and oxygen. Above it is a thin helium-burning shell, surrounded in turn by a hydrogen-burning shell. However, this new phase lasts only 20,000 years or so, a very short period compared to the entire lifetime of the star.\n\nThe venting of atmosphere continues unabated into interstellar space, but when the outer surface of the exposed core reaches temperatures exceeding about 30,000&nbsp;K, there are enough emitted [[ultraviolet]] [[photon]]s to [[ionisation|ionize]] the ejected atmosphere, causing the gas to shine as a planetary nebula.<ref name=Harpaz6/>\n\n==Lifetime==\n[[File:Necklace Nebula.jpg|thumb| The [[Necklace Nebula]] consists of a bright ring, measuring about two light-years across, dotted with dense, bright knots of gas that resemble diamonds in a necklace.

The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB.<ref name=KwokJun2005 /> As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss.<ref name=KwokJun2005 /> In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse.<ref name=Kwok1/><ref name=KwokJun2005 /> During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity,<ref name=KwokJun2005 /> while at the same time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000&nbsp;K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud.

The typical color temperatures of PNs are between 100 and 200 K, and at \u03bb >5 \u03bcm, dust begins to dominate over bound-free emission from the ionized component. Although PNs are traditionally discovered through examination of photographic plates or H\u03b1 surveys, PNs can also be identified in infrared surveys by searching for red objects with a rising spectrum between 4\u201310 \u03bcm.\n | issue = S234\n | journal = Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union, Symposium #234\n | volume = 2\n| doi-access = free\n }}\n* {{citation\n | bibcode = 2000MNRAS.312..585L\n | date = March 2000\n | last1 = Liu\n | first1 = X.-W.\n | last2 = Storey\n | first2 = P.

Using a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] to disperse their light, [[William Huggins]] was one of the earliest astronomers to study the [[optical spectrum|optical spectra]] of astronomical objects.<ref name=Moore2007/>\n\nOn August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed [[Cat's Eye Nebula]].<ref name=Kwok1/> His observations of stars had shown that their spectra consisted of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of radiation with many [[absorption line|dark lines]] superimposed. He found that many nebulous objects such as the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. However, when Huggins looked at the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], he found a very different spectrum. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Cat's Eye Nebula and other similar objects showed a number of [[Emission spectrum|emission lines]].<ref name=Moore2007/> Brightest of these was at a wavelength of 500.7&nbsp;[[nanometre]]s, which did not correspond with a line of any known element.<ref name=Huggins1864>{{harvnb|Huggins|Miller|1864|pp=437\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAt first, it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named [[nebulium]]. A similar idea had led to the discovery of [[helium]] through analysis of the [[Sun]]'s spectrum in 1868.<ref name=Kwok1/> While helium was isolated on Earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the Sun, \"nebulium\" was not. In the early 20th century, [[Henry Norris Russell]] proposed that, rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7&nbsp;nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.<ref name=Kwok1/>\n\nPhysicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low densities, [[electron]]s can occupy [[excited state|excited]] [[Metastability|metastable]] [[energy level]]s in atoms and ions that would otherwise be de-excited by collisions that would occur at higher densities.<ref name=Bowen1927>{{harvnb|Bowen|1927|pp=295\u20137}}</ref> Electron transitions from these levels in [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ions ({{nowrap|O<sup>+</sup>}}, [[Doubly ionized oxygen|{{nowrap|O<sup>2+</sup>}}]] (a.k.a. O&nbsp;{{Smallcaps|iii}}), and {{nowrap|N<sup>+</sup>}}) give rise to the 500.7&nbsp;nm emission line and others.<ref name=Kwok1/> These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called ''[[forbidden line]]s''. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that nebulae were made of extremely rarefied gas.<ref name=Gurzadyan>{{harvnb|Gurzadyan|1997}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Potw1550a.tif|thumb|Planetary nebula [[NGC 3699]] is distinguished by an irregular mottled appearance and a dark rift.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Planetary Nebula Divided|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1550a/|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Central stars ===\n\nThe central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot.<ref name=\"Frankowskietal2009\" /> Only when a star has exhausted most of its nuclear fuel can it collapse to a small size. Planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of [[stellar evolution]]. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding.

As many as four pairs of rings are seen in the bipolar lobes, and three rings are seen in the central torus. While the rings in the lobes have the same axis as one pair of the bipolar lobes, the inner rings are aligned with the other pair. The two pairs of bipolar lobes are likely to be carved out by two separate high-velocity outflows from the circumstellar material left over from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind. The two-dimensional rings could be the results of dynamical instabilities or the consequence of a fast outflow interacting with remnants of discrete AGB circumstellar shells.\n| doi-access = free\n }}\n* {{citation\n | bibcode = 2006IAUS..234..445K\n | title = Planetary nebulae in the GLIMPSE survey\n | last1 = Kwok\n | first1 = Sun\n | last2 = Koning\n | first2 = Nico\n | last3 = Huang\n | first3 = Hsiu-Hui\n | last4 = Churchwell\n | first4 = Edward\n | date = 2006\n | series = Planetary Nebulae in our Galaxy and Beyond\n | editor1-last = Barlow\n | editor1-first = M.

Prothero pointed out that the \"Cambrian Explosion\" concept itself has been deemed an outdated concept after recent decades of fossil discovery and he points out that 'Cambrian diversification' is a more consensual term now used in paleontology to describe the 80 million-year time frame where the fossil record shows the gradual and stepwise evolution of more and more complicated animal life.  Prothero criticizes Meyer for ignoring much of the [[fossil record]] and instead focusing on a later stage to give the impression that all Cambrian life forms appeared abruptly without predecessors. In contrast, Prothero cites paleontologist B.S. Lieberman that the rates of evolution during the 'Cambrian explosion' were typical of any [[adaptive radiation]] in life's history.  He quotes another prominent paleontologist [[Andrew Knoll]] that '20 million years is a long time for organisms that produce a new generation every year or two' without the need to invoke any unknown processes. Going through a list of topics in modern [[evolutionary biology]] Meyer used to bolster his idea in the book, Prothero asserts that Meyer, not a paleontologist nor a [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]], does not understand these scientific disciplines, therefore he misinterprets, distorts and confuses the data, all for the purpose of promoting the '[[intelligent design#God of the gaps|God of the gaps]]' argument: 'anything that is currently not easily explained by science is automatically attributed to supernatural causes', i.e. intelligent design.\n\nIn his article \"Doubting 'Darwin's Doubt'\" published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/doubting-stephen-meyers-darwins-doubt.html|title=Doubting \"Darwin's Doubt\"|author=Cook, Gareth|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2 July 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> [[Gareth Cook]] says that this book is another attempt by the creationist to rekindle the intelligent design movement. Decades of fossil discovery around the world, aided by new computational analytical techniques enable scientists to construct a more complete portrait of the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] which was not available to Darwin (hence his \"doubt\" in Meyer's words). The contemporary scientific consensus is that there was no \"explosion\". Cook cites [[Nick Matzke]]'s analysis that the major gaps identified by Meyer are derived from his lack of understanding of the field's key statistical techniques (among other things) and his misleading rearrangement of the tree of life.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/06/meyers-hopeless-2.html|title=Meyer's Hopeless Monster, Part II|author=Matzke, Nick|publisher=Panda's Thumb|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> Cook references scientific literature<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Manyuan|last2=Betran|first2=Esther|last3=Thornton|first3=Kevin|last4=Wang|first4=Wen|title=The origin of new genes: glimpses from the young and old|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|volume=4|pages=865\u2013875|year=2003|publisher=Nature|doi= 10.1038/nrg1204|pmid=14634634|issue=11}}</ref> to refute Meyer's argument that the genetic machinery of life is incapable of big leaps therefore any major biological advancement must be the result of intervention by the 'intelligent designer'.  Like Prothero, Cook also criticizes Meyer's proposal that if something cannot be fully explained by today's science, it must be the work of a supreme deity.  Calling it a 'masterwork of [[pseudoscience]]', Cook warns that the influence of this book should not be underestimated.  Cook opines that the book, with Meyer sewing skillfully together the trappings of science, wielding his credential of a [[Ph.D.]] (in [[history of science]]) from the [[University of Cambridge]], writing in a seemingly serious and reasonable manner, will appeal to a large audience who is hungry for material evidence of God or considers science a conspiracy against spirituality.\n\nFrom a different perspective, paleontologist Charles Marshall wrote in his review \"When Prior Belief Trumps Scholarship\" published in [[Science (magazine)|Science]] that while trying to build the scientific case for intelligent design, Meyer allows his deep belief to steer his understanding and interpretation of the scientific data and fossil records collected for the Cambrian period. The result (this book) is selective knowledge (scholarship) that is plagued with misrepresentation, omission, and dismissal of the scientific consensus; exacerbated by Meyer's lack of scientific knowledge and superficial understanding in the relevant fields, especially [[molecular phylogenetics]] and [[morphogenesis]]. The main argument of Meyer is the mathematically impossible time scale that is needed to support emergence of new [[genes]] which drive the explosion of new species during the Cambrian period. Marshall points out that the relatively fast appearance of new animal species in this period is not driven by new genes, but rather by evolving from existing genes through \"rewiring\" of the [[gene regulatory networks]] (GRNs). This basis of morphogenesis is dismissed by Meyer due to his fixation on novel genes and new protein folds as prerequisite of emergence of new species. The root of his bias is his \"God of the gaps\" approach to knowledge and the sentimental quest to \"provide solace to those who feel their faith undermined by secular society and by science in particular\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Charles|title=When Prior Belief Trumps Scholarship|journal=Science|volume=341|issue=6152|page=1344|year=2013|publisher=AAAS|doi=10.1126/science.1244515|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1344.1.full.pdf|bibcode=2013Sci...341.1344M}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last1=DeForrest  |first1= ME |last2= DeWolf |first2= DK |last3= Meyer S|first3= C |title= Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curriculum: A Legal Guidebook |publisher= Foundation for Thought and Ethics |location= Richardson, Tex |date= 1999 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-9642104-1-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Meyer |first1= SC |last2= Behe |first2= MJ. |last3=Lamantia |first3=  P |last4=Dembski |first4= WA |title= Science and evidence for design in the universe: papers presented at a conference sponsored by the Wethersfield Institute, New York City, September 25, 1999 |publisher=Ignatius Press |location= San Francisco |date= 2000 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-89870-809-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Meyer |first1= SC |last2= Campbell |first2= JC |title= Darwinism, design, and public education |publisher= Michigan State University Press |location= East Lansing |date= 2003 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-87013-675-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last= Meyer |first= SC |title= Signature in the cell: DNA and the evidence for intelligent design |publisher=HarperOne |location= |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-0-06-147278-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last= Meyer |first= SC |date= 2013 |title= Darwin's Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design |publisher= HarperOne |isbn=  978-0062071477 }}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n| last = Forrest\n| first= Barbara\n| authorlink= Barbara Forrest\n| first2 = Paul R. \n| last2 = Gross\n| author2-link= Paul R.

Prothero pointed out that the \"Cambrian Explosion\" concept itself has been deemed an outdated concept after recent decades of fossil discovery and he points out that 'Cambrian diversification' is a more consensual term now used in paleontology to describe the 80 million-year time frame where the fossil record shows the gradual and stepwise evolution of more and more complicated animal life.  Prothero criticizes Meyer for ignoring much of the [[fossil record]] and instead focusing on a later stage to give the impression that all Cambrian life forms appeared abruptly without predecessors. In contrast, Prothero cites paleontologist B.S. Lieberman that the rates of evolution during the 'Cambrian explosion' were typical of any [[adaptive radiation]] in life's history.  He quotes another prominent paleontologist [[Andrew Knoll]] that '20 million years is a long time for organisms that produce a new generation every year or two' without the need to invoke any unknown processes. Going through a list of topics in modern [[evolutionary biology]] Meyer used to bolster his idea in the book, Prothero asserts that Meyer, not a paleontologist nor a [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]], does not understand these scientific disciplines, therefore he misinterprets, distorts and confuses the data, all for the purpose of promoting the '[[intelligent design#God of the gaps|God of the gaps]]' argument: 'anything that is currently not easily explained by science is automatically attributed to supernatural causes', i.e. intelligent design.\n\nIn his article \"Doubting 'Darwin's Doubt'\" published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/doubting-stephen-meyers-darwins-doubt.html|title=Doubting \"Darwin's Doubt\"|author=Cook, Gareth|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2 July 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> [[Gareth Cook]] says that this book is another attempt by the creationist to rekindle the intelligent design movement. Decades of fossil discovery around the world, aided by new computational analytical techniques enable scientists to construct a more complete portrait of the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] which was not available to Darwin (hence his \"doubt\" in Meyer's words). The contemporary scientific consensus is that there was no \"explosion\".

Calling it a 'masterwork of [[pseudoscience]]', Cook warns that the influence of this book should not be underestimated.  Cook opines that the book, with Meyer sewing skillfully together the trappings of science, wielding his credential of a [[Ph.D.]] (in [[history of science]]) from the [[University of Cambridge]], writing in a seemingly serious and reasonable manner, will appeal to a large audience who is hungry for material evidence of God or considers science a conspiracy against spirituality.\n\nFrom a different perspective, paleontologist Charles Marshall wrote in his review \"When Prior Belief Trumps Scholarship\" published in [[Science (magazine)|Science]] that while trying to build the scientific case for intelligent design, Meyer allows his deep belief to steer his understanding and interpretation of the scientific data and fossil records collected for the Cambrian period. The result (this book) is selective knowledge (scholarship) that is plagued with misrepresentation, omission, and dismissal of the scientific consensus; exacerbated by Meyer's lack of scientific knowledge and superficial understanding in the relevant fields, especially [[molecular phylogenetics]] and [[morphogenesis]]. The main argument of Meyer is the mathematically impossible time scale that is needed to support emergence of new [[genes]] which drive the explosion of new species during the Cambrian period. Marshall points out that the relatively fast appearance of new animal species in this period is not driven by new genes, but rather by evolving from existing genes through \"rewiring\" of the [[gene regulatory networks]] (GRNs). This basis of morphogenesis is dismissed by Meyer due to his fixation on novel genes and new protein folds as prerequisite of emergence of new species. The root of his bias is his \"God of the gaps\" approach to knowledge and the sentimental quest to \"provide solace to those who feel their faith undermined by secular society and by science in particular\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Charles|title=When Prior Belief Trumps Scholarship|journal=Science|volume=341|issue=6152|page=1344|year=2013|publisher=AAAS|doi=10.1126/science.1244515|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1344.1.full.pdf|bibcode=2013Sci...341.1344M}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last1=DeForrest  |first1= ME |last2= DeWolf |first2= DK |last3= Meyer S|first3= C |title= Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curriculum: A Legal Guidebook |publisher= Foundation for Thought and Ethics |location= Richardson, Tex |date= 1999 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-9642104-1-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Meyer |first1= SC |last2= Behe |first2= MJ. |last3=Lamantia |first3=  P |last4=Dembski |first4= WA |title= Science and evidence for design in the universe: papers presented at a conference sponsored by the Wethersfield Institute, New York City, September 25, 1999 |publisher=Ignatius Press |location= San Francisco |date= 2000 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-89870-809-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Meyer |first1= SC |last2= Campbell |first2= JC |title= Darwinism, design, and public education |publisher= Michigan State University Press |location= East Lansing |date= 2003 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-87013-675-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last= Meyer |first= SC |title= Signature in the cell: DNA and the evidence for intelligent design |publisher=HarperOne |location= |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-0-06-147278-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n* {{cite book |last= Meyer |first= SC |date= 2013 |title= Darwin's Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design |publisher= HarperOne |isbn=  978-0062071477 }}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n| last = Forrest\n| first= Barbara\n| authorlink= Barbara Forrest\n| first2 = Paul R. \n| last2 = Gross\n| author2-link= Paul R.

The film stars [[Mel Gibson]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Brawley Nolte]], [[Delroy Lindo]], [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Evan Handler]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]], and [[Lili Taylor]]. Gibson was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]]. The film was the 6th highest-grossing film of 1996 in the United States. The original story came from a 1954 episode of ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' titled \"Fearful Decision\". In 1956, it was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Cyril Hume]] into the feature film ''[[Ransom!]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[Donna Reed]], and [[Leslie Nielsen]]. The film was also influenced by [[Ed McBain]]'s [[police procedural]] novel ''[[King's Ransom (novel)|King's Ransom]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile multi-millionaire Tom Mullen and his wife Kate attend a science fair, their son Sean is kidnapped. Sean is taken to an apartment by Maris, a caterer for the Mullens, along with criminals Clark, Cubby and Miles, and Detective Jimmy Shaker, Maris' boyfriend and the mastermind behind the kidnapping. Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding $2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping.\n\nTom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the [[ransom]]. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off. While Tom initially agrees to take the money alone, he realizes there is no guarantee Sean will be returned alive and instead appears on television to offer the ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers' heads, promising to withdraw the bounty and drop all charges if the kidnappers return his son alive and unharmed.\n\nDespite the pleadings of Kate and Agent Hawkins, Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance of having Sean returned. Shaker lures Kate to a meeting where he tells her to pay the ransom or Sean will die before ditching Sean's blood stained t-shirt. Tom responds by increasing the bounty to $4,000,000. Shaker calls Tom and demands to be paid, but Tom still refuses, and Shaker fires a gunshot after Tom hears Sean scream for help, leading Tom and Kate to believe their son is dead. Clark and Miles attempt to abandon the plan and flee, but Shaker calls in the NYPD to request backup and kills both of his men while making it look like Miles shot first, and kills Maris after she shoots him in the arm from behind. The NYPD arrive and find Shaker with Sean, believing Shaker found and rescued the boy. Hawkins informs Tom and Kate and they are reunited with their son while Shaker is hospitalized. Tom also recognizes Maris.\n\nShaker later pays Tom a visit to claim the reward and leave the country before investigators discover his connection with Maris. Tom and Sean, however, recognize Shaker as the kidnapper, and Shaker realizes this. Though his initial plan is to kill everyone in the apartment, Tom persuades him to accompany him to the bank to gain the money and leave peacefully. On the way, however, Tom discreetly alerts Hawkins and the police and FBI converge on Tom and Shaker outside the bank. As soon as Tom and Shaker exit the bank, two officers (who greeted Shaker and Tom before entering the bank) inform Shaker that he is going to be detained, causing Shaker to shoot them down before Tom knocks him to the ground after which a chase ensues in which Tom and Shaker grapple furiously before falling through a shop window, severely injuring both and impaling Shaker through the neck. Tom picks up a hidden pistol (that Shaker pulled out during the scuffle) and points at Shaker before Hawkins and other police officers keep demanding that he drop the gun and walk away. In desperation, Shaker draws another hidden gun but is shot dead by Tom and Hawkins. Tom finally drops the gun and police rush in to arrest Tom, but Hawkins tells them to hold as it was self-defense allowing Tom and Kate to leave the scene.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Tom Mullen\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Kate Mullen\n* [[Brawley Nolte]] as Sean Mullen\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Det.
