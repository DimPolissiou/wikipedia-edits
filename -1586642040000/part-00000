The company originally intended to design [[flight simulator]]s for the aircraft industry but shifted to amusement rides after an early simulator, called Orientator, became a popular pay-per-ride attraction with the public. The company manufactured rides until 1985 and went bankrupt in 1990, following a fatal accident in 1988 that occurred on a ride built by the company.\n\n== Aircraft manufacturing ==\nLee Eyerly founded Eyerly Aircraft Company in 1930 to manufacture two inexpensive ways to train pilots which he devised when the [[Great Depression]] hit. The first was the Whiffle Hen,<ref name=\"oahof\">{{cite web |url=http://oregonaviation.org/hall-of-fame/ | title=Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame | work=Oregon Aviation Historical Society | accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> a plane which only burned two US gallons (8 L) of fuel per hour of flight. The second was a ground-based flight training device patented under the name \"Orientator\". The Orientator consisted of a small airplane suspended in what looked like the tines of a giant tuning fork. Air from the electrically driven propeller passed over the wings and rudder, and the operator controlled the movements of the plane in a manner similar to a real aircraft.<ref name=\"billboard651\">{{Cite journal | title = Eyerlys Keep Eyes in Air for Well-Grounded Ideas | author = Abbott, Sam | work = The Billboard | date = June 30, 1951 | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&source=bl&ots=xISdAOR0zk&sig=xa4Sf75hO9poBrr48W-QQ9C0ypQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=f3WjVeOoBMLtoASZgp-YDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage | page = 91 }}</ref> The Orientator was produced commercially and eventually renamed the [[Acroplane]].\n\n== Amusement rides ==\nA salesman approached Eyerly about selling them to carnivals and parks as an amusement ride after noticing several Acroplanes stored on the lot outside Eyerly's shop.

The company originally intended to design [[flight simulator]]s for the aircraft industry but shifted to amusement rides after an early simulator, called Orientator, became a popular pay-per-ride attraction with the public. The company manufactured rides until 1985 and went bankrupt in 1990, following a fatal accident in 1988 that occurred on a ride built by the company.\n\n== Aircraft manufacturing ==\nLee Eyerly founded Eyerly Aircraft Company in 1930 to manufacture two inexpensive ways to train pilots which he devised when the [[Great Depression]] hit. The first was the Whiffle Hen,<ref name=\"oahof\">{{cite web |url=http://oregonaviation.org/hall-of-fame/ | title=Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame | work=Oregon Aviation Historical Society | accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> a plane which only burned two US gallons (8 L) of fuel per hour of flight. The second was a ground-based flight training device patented under the name \"Orientator\". The Orientator consisted of a small airplane suspended in what looked like the tines of a giant tuning fork. Air from the electrically driven propeller passed over the wings and rudder, and the operator controlled the movements of the plane in a manner similar to a real aircraft.<ref name=\"billboard651\">{{Cite journal | title = Eyerlys Keep Eyes in Air for Well-Grounded Ideas | author = Abbott, Sam | work = The Billboard | date = June 30, 1951 | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&source=bl&ots=xISdAOR0zk&sig=xa4Sf75hO9poBrr48W-QQ9C0ypQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=f3WjVeOoBMLtoASZgp-YDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage | page = 91 }}</ref> The Orientator was produced commercially and eventually renamed the [[Acroplane]].\n\n== Amusement rides ==\nA salesman approached Eyerly about selling them to carnivals and parks as an amusement ride after noticing several Acroplanes stored on the lot outside Eyerly's shop. While Eyerly was initially skeptical, he agreed to a deal which led to selling about 50 Acroplanes as an amusement ride. The following year, Eyerly changed the company's focus from aircraft to amusement rides based on the successful sales.<ref name=\"billboard651\" /> Eyerly developed and patented numerous amusement rides which would become staples of carnival midways, including The [[Loop-O-Plane]] (1933),<ref name=\"billboard651\" /><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Western Flying Magazine | title=Eyerly Invents \"Loop-O-Plane\" | volume=13 | month= | year=1933 | publisher=Occidental Publishing Company | page=24}}</ref> the [[Roll-O-Plane]],<ref name=\"dcj539\">{{cite news|title=Loop-o-Plane, Octopus and Rolloplane |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2798530/daily_capital_journal/|newspaper=Daily Capital Journal|date=May 6, 1939|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 12, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> the [[Fly-O-Plane]] and the [[Rock-O-Plane]] (1947).<ref name=\"are-rocko\">{{Cite web | title = Rock O Plane | publisher = Amusement Ride Extravaganza | work = ride-extravaganza.com | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=http://www.ride-extravaganza.com/thrill/rock-o-plane/ }}</ref><ref name=\"la-rocko\">{{Cite web | title = Rock-O-Plane | publisher = Lewellen Amusements | work = lewellenamusements.com | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=http://www.lewellenamusements.com/Rock.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324161405/http://www.lewellenamusements.com/Rock.html |archivedate=March 24, 2010}}</ref> Perhaps their most popular design was the [[Octopus (ride)|Octopus]],<ref name=\"dcj539\" /> which resulted in later variations: the [[Spider (ride)|Spider]] and the [[Monster (ride)|Monster]].

The museum was established in 1909 by the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, an organization whose goals were to provide a free institution for the people of Houston focusing on education and science. Museum attendance totals over two million visitors each year. The museum complex consists of a central facility with four floors of natural science halls and exhibits, the Burke Baker Planetarium, the Cockrell Butterfly Center, and the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre (formerly known as the Wortham IMAX Theatre). The museum is one of the most popular in the United States and ranks just below [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in most attendance amongst non-[[Smithsonian]] museums.<ref>Berger, Eric. (2006, November 20).

Houston Chronicle.</ref>  Much of the museum's popularity is attributed to its large number of special or guest exhibits.\n\n==History==\nThe initial museum organization was called the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, Inc., and was created in 1909. The museum's primary collection was acquired between 1914 and 1930. This included the purchase of a natural-history collection assembled by [[Henry Philemon Attwater]] and a donation from collector John Milsaps, the latter of which formed the core of the museum's gem and mineral collection.<ref name=\"Wilson\">Wilson, Wendell E., Bartsch, Joel A., Mauthner, Mark.

The museum's now wide-ranging education programs began in 1947 and, in its second year, hosted 12,000 children.<ref>http://www.hmnspress.org/HMNS_History.aspx</ref>\n\n[[File:Morian Hall of Paleontology - Houston Museum of Natural Science 2.JPG|thumb|Morian Hall of Paleontology]]\nThe museum was officially renamed the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 1960.

In 1988, the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education|Challenger Learning Center]] was opened in memory of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|tenth mission]]. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the offsite George Observatory were opened in 1989.\n\nMuseum attendance was more than one million visitors in 1990. HMNS trustees determined that new state-of-the-art facilities, additional space, and renovations to current exhibits were needed because of the increased attendance. Between 1991 and 1994, a number of exhibit halls were renovated and the expansion of the Sterling Hall of Research was completed. The Cockrell Butterfly Center and the Brown Hall of Entomology opened in July 1994.\n\n[[File:HMNSSugarLandOldCentralUnit.jpg|thumb|left|The HMNS Sugar Land satellite museum in [[Telfair, Sugar Land|Telfair]], [[Sugar Land, Texas]].]]\nIn March 2007, the museum opened the HMNS [[The Woodlands, Texas|Woodlands]] X-ploration Station, located in the Woodlands Mall.

The museum was established in 1909 by the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, an organization whose goals were to provide a free institution for the people of Houston focusing on education and science. Museum attendance totals over two million visitors each year. The museum complex consists of a central facility with four floors of natural science halls and exhibits, the Burke Baker Planetarium, the Cockrell Butterfly Center, and the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre (formerly known as the Wortham IMAX Theatre). The museum is one of the most popular in the United States and ranks just below [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in most attendance amongst non-[[Smithsonian]] museums.<ref>Berger, Eric. (2006, November 20).

Houston Chronicle.</ref>  Much of the museum's popularity is attributed to its large number of special or guest exhibits.\n\n==History==\nThe initial museum organization was called the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, Inc., and was created in 1909. The museum's primary collection was acquired between 1914 and 1930. This included the purchase of a natural-history collection assembled by [[Henry Philemon Attwater]] and a donation from collector John Milsaps, the latter of which formed the core of the museum's gem and mineral collection.<ref name=\"Wilson\">Wilson, Wendell E., Bartsch, Joel A., Mauthner, Mark.

The museum's now wide-ranging education programs began in 1947 and, in its second year, hosted 12,000 children.<ref>http://www.hmnspress.org/HMNS_History.aspx</ref>\n\n[[File:Morian Hall of Paleontology - Houston Museum of Natural Science 2.JPG|thumb|Morian Hall of Paleontology]]\nThe museum was officially renamed the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 1960.

In 1988, the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education|Challenger Learning Center]] was opened in memory of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|tenth mission]]. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the offsite George Observatory were opened in 1989.\n\nMuseum attendance was more than one million visitors in 1990. HMNS trustees determined that new state-of-the-art facilities, additional space, and renovations to current exhibits were needed because of the increased attendance. Between 1991 and 1994, a number of exhibit halls were renovated and the expansion of the Sterling Hall of Research was completed. The Cockrell Butterfly Center and the Brown Hall of Entomology opened in July 1994.\n\n[[File:HMNSSugarLandOldCentralUnit.jpg|thumb|left|The HMNS Sugar Land satellite museum in [[Telfair, Sugar Land|Telfair]], [[Sugar Land, Texas]].]]\nIn March 2007, the museum opened the HMNS [[The Woodlands, Texas|Woodlands]] X-ploration Station, located in the Woodlands Mall.

Cutler as its first settler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2483|title=A Brief History of Waukesha|date=2012-08-16|website=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> When the first settlers arrived, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.<ref>''The History of Waukesha County, Wisconsin: Containing an Account of Its Settlement, Growth, Development and Resources''. 1880 pp. 173, 232, 233.</ref>\n\nThe original founders of Waukesha consisted entirely of settlers from [[New England]], particularly [[Connecticut]], rural [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]], as well some from [[upstate New York]] who were born to parents who had migrated to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were \"[[Yankee]]\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the [[Northwest Territory]] during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] as well as the end of the [[Black Hawk War]]. When they arrived in what is now Waukesha County there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the [[English American|New Englanders]] laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their [[Yankee]] New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the [[Congregationalist Church]] though some were [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]. Due to the [[second Great Awakening]] some of them had converted to [[Methodism]] and some had become [[Baptists]] before moving to what is now Waukesha County.<ref>The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Hall Holbrook.

Cutler as its first settler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2483|title=A Brief History of Waukesha|date=2012-08-16|website=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> When the first settlers arrived, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.<ref>''The History of Waukesha County, Wisconsin: Containing an Account of Its Settlement, Growth, Development and Resources''. 1880 pp. 173, 232, 233.</ref>\n\nThe original founders of Waukesha consisted entirely of settlers from [[New England]], particularly [[Connecticut]], rural [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]], as well some from [[upstate New York]] who were born to parents who had migrated to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were \"[[Yankee]]\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the [[Northwest Territory]] during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] as well as the end of the [[Black Hawk War]]. When they arrived in what is now Waukesha County there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the [[English American|New Englanders]] laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their [[Yankee]] New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the [[Congregationalist Church]] though some were [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]. Due to the [[second Great Awakening]] some of them had converted to [[Methodism]] and some had become [[Baptists]] before moving to what is now Waukesha County.<ref>The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Hall Holbrook.
