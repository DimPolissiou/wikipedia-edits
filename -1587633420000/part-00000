However, the truce was broken shortly afterwards. Pope Paul IV was displeased and urged Henry II to join the Papal States in an invasion of Spanish Naples. On 1 September 1556, Philip II responded by preemptively invading the Papal States with 12,000 men under the Duke of Alba, but French forces approaching from the north were defeated and forced to withdraw at Civitella in August 1557.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Woodward |first=Geoffrey |title=Philip II |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1317897730 |location=London, New York |chapter=8}}</ref> The Spanish attempted to blockade Rome by occupying the port of Ostia, but were driven back by the Papal armies in a surprise attack. However, when French troops were unable to come to their aid, the Papal armies were left exposed and were defeated, with Spanish troops arriving at the edge of Rome. Out of fear of another sack of Rome, Paul IV agreed to the Duke of Alba's demand for the Papal States to declare neutrality.

Cavalry, which had traditionally used shock tactics to overawe the infantry, largely abandoned them and relied on pistol attacks by successive ranks of attackers.

By 1554, the cash deficit for the year was calculated to be over 4.3&nbsp;million ducats, even after all tax receipts for the six ensuing years had been pledged and the proceeds spent in advance. Credit at this point began costing the crown 43 percent interest (largely financed by the [[Fugger]] and [[Welser]] banking families). By 1557 the crown was refusing payment from the Indies since even this was required for payment of the war effort (used in the offensive and Spanish victory at the battle of St. Quentin in August 1557).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lynch |first=John |title=Spain Under the Habsburgs |publisher=New York University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-8147-5010-9 |edition=2nd |location=New York |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nFrench finances during the war were mainly financed by the increase in the [[taille]] tax, as well as indirect taxes like the [[Gabelle of salt|gabelle]] and customs fees.

The [[Duchy of Milan]] and the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] were left in personal union to the King of Spain while continuing to be part of the Holy Roman Empire. With the end of the personal union of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain (\"Habsburg encirclement\"), France was open to peace talks. A truce was reached in Vaucelles around 1556, but it was broken shortly after. The condition of economic and religious turmoil in which the war resumed forced the parties to make peace in 1559.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Knecht |first=Robert Jean |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catherine_De_Medici.html?id=qAojAQAAIAAJ |title=Catherine De' Medici |date=1998 |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0-582-08242-7 |pages=54 |author-link=Robert Knecht}}</ref> \n\nBy the terms of the treaties, France ended military operations in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)#Imperial fiefs|Imperial fiefs of northern Italy]] bringing an end to most of the French occupation in Corsica, Tuscany and Piedmont. England and the Habsburgs, in exchange, ended their opposition to French occupation of the [[Pale of Calais]], the [[Three Bishoprics]], and a number of fortresses. For [[Spain]], despite no new gains and the restoration of some occupied territories to France, the peace was a positive result as it confirmed its control of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], the [[Duchy of Milan]], and southern Italy (Sardinia, Naples, Sicily). [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] left the Three Bishoprics under French occupation, but the Netherlands and most of northern Italy remained part of the Holy Roman Empire in the form of imperial fiefs. Furthermore, his position of Holy Roman Emperor was recognized by the Pope who had refused to do so as long as the war between France and the Habsburgs continued. England fared poorly during the war, and the loss of its last stronghold on the continent damaged its reputation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tudorsociety.com/an-overview-of-the-results-of-the-treaty-of-cateau-cambresis-1569/ |title=An Overview of the Results of the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis 1559 |last=Ridgway |first=Claire |date=2017-04-03 |website=The Tudor Society |df=dmy-all |access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the conflict, Italy was therefore divided between [[viceroyalties]] of the Spanish Habsburgs in the south and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|formal fiefs]] of the Austrian Habsburgs in the north. The imperial states were ruled by the [[Doria family|Doria]] in Genoa, the [[House of Medici|Medici]] in Tuscany, the Spanish Habsburgs in Milan, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] in Parma, the [[House of Este|Estensi]] in Modena, and an ''Italianized'' [[House of Savoy]] in Piedmont. The southern Kingdoms of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were under direct rule of the Spanish Habsburgs. This situation continued until the European wars of succession of the 18th century, when northern Italy passed to the Austrian house of [[Habsburg-Lorraine]] and the south passed to the [[Spanish Bourbons]].

Its plot follows a young woman who, emotionally stifled in her marriage and domestic life, develops an impulse to [[Pica (disorder)|consume inedible objects]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 28, 2019. It was released in France on January 15, 2020, by UFO Distribution, and in the United States on March 6, 2020, by [[IFC Films]].\n\n==Plot==\nHunter, a young woman from a lower working-class family in [[upstate New York]] has recently married Richie, a man from a wealthy family who is set to take over as CEO of his father's [[Manhattan]] corporation. This affords Hunter, once an aspiring illustrator, the ability to stay at home in the couple's lavish upstate home on the [[Hudson River]]. Despite this, Hunter finds herself increasingly emotionally stifled and isolated in both her marriage and domestic life, and finds Richie distant and inconsiderate toward her. One day while home alone, Hunter develops the impulse to eat a [[Marble (toy)|marble]], and musters the courage to do so. She finds it exhilarating, and begins to consume other inedible objects around the house, including [[Drawing pin|thumbtack]]s, metal figurines, and batteries. Each item she swallows, once digested, she meticulously cleans and arranges on her vanity.\n\nAfter Hunter finds out she is pregnant, she and Richie visit the hospital for a routine ultrasound, during which the technician notices an anomaly in Hunter's abdomen. She is rushed in for emergency surgery to remove a variety of objects trapped in her intestine. After the surgery, Hunter is diagnosed with [[Pica (disorder)|pica]], a psychological disorder that propels individuals to eat inedible objects. Richie's parents, Katherine and Michael, arrange for her to see Alice, a psychologist, in the city. During her sessions with Alice, Hunter slowly divulges her attraction to consuming the objects, which she mainly says has to do with their textures. \n\nAt the behest of his parents, Richie hires Luay, a family friend and immigrant from [[Syria]], to monitor Hunter while he is at work during the day. Hunter, feeling increasingly smothered, is initially hostile toward Luay, who dismisses her mental illness as resulting from her privileged life. Despite the external efforts to stop it, Hunter continues to covertly consume objects. Through her continued sessions with Alice, Hunter reveals that her biological father was a criminal who stalked and raped her mother over a nine-day period, resulting in Hunter's conception. Alice believes this revelation is linked to Hunter's disorder, but Hunter dismisses it.\n\nWhile gardening one afternoon, Hunter overhears Richie speaking with Alice on the phone, and realizes Richie has financially bribed Alice to reveal the content of her and Hunter's sessions. This sends her into a panic, and, when Richie leaves the house, Hunter swallows a miniature [[screwdriver]] she finds in the kitchen. Luay finds her choking violently, and phones emergency services. After undergoing surgery to remove the screwdriver, Michael and Katherine arrange to have Hunter committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] for the next seven months, until she delivers her baby, threatening that Richie will divorce her otherwise. Hunter agrees, but before they are to leave, Hunter returns inside with Luay, saying she forgot her cell phone charger. Luay, who has warmed to Hunter, allows her flee into the woods, and stages it to appear as though she covertly escaped from the bathroom window.\n\nHunter hitchhikes to a motel, and calls Richie, who begs her to return. She explains to him that she rushed into their marriage and her pregnancy to make him happy. When she refuses to come back, he chastises her for being an \"ungrateful [[cunt]].\" Hunter smashes her cell phone, and spends the rest of the night watching television and eating [[soil]] she obtained from outside. The next day, Hunter hitchhikes to the home of her biological father, a man named William Erwin. She enters his home, where he and his wife, Lucy, are having a birthday party for their daughter. They assume Hunter is the parent of one of their daughter's friends, but Hunter privately reveals her true identity to William. During an emotional conversation, William professes his shame for what he did, and Hunter asks him if he is ashamed of her, and if she is like him, to which he responds no.\n\nHaving obtained closure from her visit with William, Hunter visits a clinic and is prescribed medication to induce an [[Medical abortion|abortion]]. She takes the pills while eating lunch in a shopping mall cafeteria, and has the abortion in the mall bathroom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Haley Bennett]] as Hunter Conrad\n* [[Austin Stowell]] as Richie Conrad\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as Katherine Conrad\n* [[David Rasche]] as Michael Conrad\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as William Erwin\n* [[Lauren V\u00e9lez]] as Lucy\n* [[Zabryna Guevara]] as Alice\n* [[Laith Nakli]] as Luay\n* Babak Tafti as Aaron\n* Nicole Kang as Bev\n* McGregory Frederique as Man Behind Desk\n}}\n==Production==\nIn September 2016, it was announced Carlo Mirabella-Davis would direct the film, from a screenplay he wrote.

Its plot follows a young woman who, emotionally stifled in her marriage and domestic life, develops an impulse to [[Pica (disorder)|consume inedible objects]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 28, 2019. It was released in France on January 15, 2020, by UFO Distribution, and in the United States on March 6, 2020, by [[IFC Films]].\n\n==Plot==\nHunter, a young woman from a lower working-class family in [[upstate New York]] has recently married Richie, a man from a wealthy family who is set to take over as CEO of his father's [[Manhattan]] corporation. This affords Hunter, once an aspiring illustrator, the ability to stay at home in the couple's lavish upstate home on the [[Hudson River]]. Despite this, Hunter finds herself increasingly emotionally stifled and isolated in both her marriage and domestic life, and finds Richie distant and inconsiderate toward her. One day while home alone, Hunter develops the impulse to eat a [[Marble (toy)|marble]], and musters the courage to do so. She finds it exhilarating, and begins to consume other inedible objects around the house, including [[Drawing pin|thumbtack]]s, metal figurines, and batteries. Each item she swallows, once digested, she meticulously cleans and arranges on her vanity.\n\nAfter Hunter finds out she is pregnant, she and Richie visit the hospital for a routine ultrasound, during which the technician notices an anomaly in Hunter's abdomen. She is rushed in for emergency surgery to remove a variety of objects trapped in her intestine. After the surgery, Hunter is diagnosed with [[Pica (disorder)|pica]], a psychological disorder that propels individuals to eat inedible objects. Richie's parents, Katherine and Michael, arrange for her to see Alice, a psychologist, in the city. During her sessions with Alice, Hunter slowly divulges her attraction to consuming the objects, which she mainly says has to do with their textures. \n\nAt the behest of his parents, Richie hires Luay, a family friend and immigrant from [[Syria]], to monitor Hunter while he is at work during the day. Hunter, feeling increasingly smothered, is initially hostile toward Luay, who dismisses her mental illness as resulting from her privileged life. Despite the external efforts to stop it, Hunter continues to covertly consume objects. Through her continued sessions with Alice, Hunter reveals that her biological father was a criminal who stalked and raped her mother over a nine-day period, resulting in Hunter's conception. Alice believes this revelation is linked to Hunter's disorder, but Hunter dismisses it.\n\nWhile gardening one afternoon, Hunter overhears Richie speaking with Alice on the phone, and realizes Richie has financially bribed Alice to reveal the content of her and Hunter's sessions. This sends her into a panic, and, when Richie leaves the house, Hunter swallows a miniature [[screwdriver]] she finds in the kitchen. Luay finds her choking violently, and phones emergency services. After undergoing surgery to remove the screwdriver, Michael and Katherine arrange to have Hunter committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] for the next seven months, until she delivers her baby, threatening that Richie will divorce her otherwise. Hunter agrees, but before they are to leave, Hunter returns inside with Luay, saying she forgot her cell phone charger. Luay, who has warmed to Hunter, allows her flee into the woods, and stages it to appear as though she covertly escaped from the bathroom window.\n\nHunter hitchhikes to a motel, and calls Richie, who begs her to return. She explains to him that she rushed into their marriage and her pregnancy to make him happy. When she refuses to come back, he chastises her for being an \"ungrateful [[cunt]].\" Hunter smashes her cell phone, and spends the rest of the night watching television and eating [[soil]] she obtained from outside. The next day, Hunter hitchhikes to the home of her biological father, a man named William Erwin. She enters his home, where he and his wife, Lucy, are having a birthday party for their daughter. They assume Hunter is the parent of one of their daughter's friends, but Hunter privately reveals her true identity to William. During an emotional conversation, William professes his shame for what he did, and Hunter asks him if he is ashamed of her, and if she is like him, to which he responds no.\n\nHaving obtained closure from her visit with William, Hunter visits a clinic and is prescribed medication to induce an [[Medical abortion|abortion]]. She takes the pills while eating lunch in a shopping mall cafeteria, and has the abortion in the mall bathroom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Haley Bennett]] as Hunter Conrad\n* [[Austin Stowell]] as Richie Conrad\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as Katherine Conrad\n* [[David Rasche]] as Michael Conrad\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as William Erwin\n* [[Lauren V\u00e9lez]] as Lucy\n* [[Zabryna Guevara]] as Alice\n* [[Laith Nakli]] as Luay\n* Babak Tafti as Aaron\n* Nicole Kang as Bev\n* McGregory Frederique as Man Behind Desk\n}}\n==Production==\nIn September 2016, it was announced Carlo Mirabella-Davis would direct the film, from a screenplay he wrote.

Unlike most backup assignments, his assignment to TMA-18M did not lead into a later prime crew assignment, therefore following the launch of TMA-18M 2 September 2016 Prokopyev did not rotated onto a prime crew immediately. \n\n===Expedition 56/57===\nProkopyev was originally meant to be Soyuz commander on [[Soyuz MS-08]] and flight engineer on ISS [[Expedition 55]]/[[Expedition 56|56]] although due to Russian budget cutbacks reducing the number of crew members on the ISS Russian segment he was removed from the flight and instead was assigned as backup Soyuz commander [[Soyuz MS-07]] and flight engineer/ISS commander for [[Expedition 54]]/[[Expedition 55|55]]<ref>http://www.spacefacts.de/iss/english/exp_55.htm</ref>.

He performed his first [[Spacewalk]] alongside Artemyev on 15 August, the two spent 7 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station where they installed a Roscosmos-[[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] experiment for observing animal migration, called ICARUS onto the outside of the station and manually deployed four [[CubeSat]] into orbit<ref>https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2018/08/15/cosmonauts-wrap-up-russian-spacewalk-for-science-work/</ref>. On 29 August an air leak was observed inside the station, this was later discovered to be caused by a hole aboard Soyuz MS-09, Prokopyev's spacecraft<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-09-hole.html</ref>.\n\nFollowing the departure of Soyuz MS-08 on 4 October 2018, Prokopyev, Gerst and Aunon-Chancellor transferred over to Expedition 57, they were shceduled to be joined by Russian cosmonaut [[Aleksey Ovchinin]] and American astronaut [[Nick Hague]] on 11 October, although the flight was aborted during launch cancelling their arrival.

On 6 June 2018 he launched on his first flight into space aboard [[Soyuz MS-09]] and spent 196 days in space as a flight engineer on [[Expedition 56]]/[[Expedition 57|57]].\n\n==Cosmonaut career==\nIn October 2010 Prokopyev was selected as a cosmonaut by [[Roscosmos]], he began cosmonaut training February 2011, he graduated and gained the qualification of \"test cosmonaut\" in August 2012<ref name=\"spacefacts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/prokopyev_sergei.htm|title=Cosmonaut Biography: Sergei Prokopyev|first=Joachim|last=Becker|website=Spacefacts.de|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>.\n\nFollowing his graduation he was part of the specialization and improvement group for the ISS [[Russian Orbital Segment]] and [[Soyuz TMA|Soyuz TMA-M]] spacecraft, he held this position until June 2015 when he was assigned to a backup crew.\n\nHe trained as backup flight engineer for [[Soyuz TMA-18M]] and ISS EP-18, training for a short-duration eight day stay on the ISS that was eventaually flown by [[KazCosmos]] cosmonaut [[Aidyn Aimbetov]]<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss-soyuz-tma18m.html</ref>. Unlike most backup assignments, his assignment to TMA-18M did not lead into a later prime crew assignment, therefore following the launch of TMA-18M 2 September 2016 Prokopyev did not rotated onto a prime crew immediately. \n\n===Expedition 56/57===\nProkopyev was originally meant to be Soyuz commander on [[Soyuz MS-08]] and flight engineer on ISS [[Expedition 55]]/[[Expedition 56|56]] although due to Russian budget cutbacks reducing the number of crew members on the ISS Russian segment he was removed from the flight and instead was assigned as backup Soyuz commander [[Soyuz MS-07]] and flight engineer/ISS commander for [[Expedition 54]]/[[Expedition 55|55]]<ref>http://www.spacefacts.de/iss/english/exp_55.htm</ref>. Following the launch of Expedition 54/55 he was assigned as prime crew flight engineer for [[Expedition 56]]/[[Expedition 57|57]] alongside [[ESA|German]] [[Alexander Gerst]], who would serve as ISS commander for Expedition 57, and NASA astronaut [[Jeanette Epps]], who would later be replaced by astronaut [[Serena Aunon-Chancellor]].\n\nThe trio launched on [[Soyuz MS-09]] from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on 6 June 2018 and spent approximately two days free flying in [[Low Earth orbit]] before the rendezvoused and docked to the ISS on 8 June, officially joined the Expedition 56 alongside American astronauts [[Andrew Feustel]] and [[Richard Arnold]] as well as Russian cosmonaut [[Oleg Artemyev]]<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition56/index.html</ref>. He performed his first [[Spacewalk]] alongside Artemyev on 15 August, the two spent 7 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station where they installed a Roscosmos-[[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] experiment for observing animal migration, called ICARUS onto the outside of the station and manually deployed four [[CubeSat]] into orbit<ref>https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2018/08/15/cosmonauts-wrap-up-russian-spacewalk-for-science-work/</ref>. On 29 August an air leak was observed inside the station, this was later discovered to be caused by a hole aboard Soyuz MS-09, Prokopyev's spacecraft<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-09-hole.html</ref>.\n\nFollowing the departure of Soyuz MS-08 on 4 October 2018, Prokopyev, Gerst and Aunon-Chancellor transferred over to Expedition 57, they were shceduled to be joined by Russian cosmonaut [[Aleksey Ovchinin]] and American astronaut [[Nick Hague]] on 11 October, although the flight was aborted during launch cancelling their arrival. In order to avoid de-crewing the space station, the landing of MS-09 was delayed from 11 December to 20 December, while the launch of [[Soyuz MS-11]] was advanced from 20 December to 3 December, giving the two spacecraft and their six crew members a 17 day hand-over period.
