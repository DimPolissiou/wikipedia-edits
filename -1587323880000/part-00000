Let's say for the moment... in the Twilight Zone.}}\n\n==Plot==\nA married couple, Chris and Ruth Miller, are awakened by the whimpering of their little daughter, Tina. Chris goes to see what the trouble is.  Their dog, Mack, begins to bark from the backyard. Chris cannot find Tina either in or under the bed, even though her pleas for help seem to be coming from nearby, yet far away. He calls Ruth into the room, and she is similarly mystified. Chris phones his [[physicist]] friend, Bill, for help, and opens the door to let the incessantly barking Mack into the house. The dog runs under the bed and disappears, but can still be heard barking, again close, but far away. \n\nBill arrives and helps Chris move the bed so that he can physically scan the area where it was, marking the legs with books. When this proves fruitless, Bill examines the wall behind the bed. His hand passes easily  through the wall and to another dimension, and draws marks on the wall outlining the apparent boundary. He explains to Chris and Ruth that sometimes lines in our three dimensions end parallel with, rather than perpendicular to, the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]. He warns them that they know nothing of what's beyond this portal, and should they follow Tina into the fourth dimension, they would only become hopelessly lost as well, since it is not manifested like the third dimension.\n\nChris calls to Mack to guide Tina back. Mack leads Tina to the source of Chris's voice, but they still cannot find the entrance. Despite Bill's warnings, Chris reaches into the portal and falls into the fourth dimension, an abstract, crystalline landscape which seems distorted, and constantly turning upside down and sideways. Bill advises him not to move. Chris sees Tina and Mack and calls them towards him. Bill calls for him to hurry. When Tina and Mack close in on Chris, Bill grabs them and pulls them back into the bedroom. Ruth rushes Tina to another room.\n\nBill explains that Chris was only halfway through the portal, despite Chris' perception that he was standing up in the new dimension. Bill was in fact holding onto Chris the entire time. He was telling Chris to hurry because the portal was closing. Bill knocks on the wall, and it is solid. The portal has closed.

Comptes Rendus Biologies 327:133\u2013138.</ref> Their external [[Seashell|shell]] provides protection and buoyancy while also separating the species from other common cephalopods ([[squid]], [[Octopus|octopuses]], [[cuttlefish]]).<ref>Jereb, P. 2005. Chambered nautiluses. Page FAO Species Catalogue for Fishery Purposes No. 4, Vol. 1.</ref> This protection comes in the form of [[countershading]], which makes it easy to hide from predators.<ref name=\":1\">Ward, P. D. 1987. The Natural History of Nautilus. Allen and Unwin, Winchester, MA. </ref> Unfortunately, this [[countershading]] is also the reason why chambered nautiluses are hunted by humans (their beautiful shells are [[Harvest|harvested]] for use in [[Jewellery|jewelry]]). This [[overfishing]] became so extreme that, in 2016, chambered nautiluses were moved to [[CITES Appendix II]], which limits [[international trade]], and they were later recognized as a [[threatened species]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/international/cites/index.html|title=CITES|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\n== Status and Conservation with ESA history ==\nChambered Nautiluses are targeted for their shells, which are traded throughout the globe for\u00a0their value as collectibles. This, combined with overfishing, [[Habitat destruction|habitat degradation]] and [[Global warming|climate change]], has led to the chambered nautilus being recognized as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] \u201c[[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]\u201d species in 2016. However, in 2017, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] delayed necessary protections which would prevent [[Import|imports]] of this [https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2018/chambered-nautilus-09-27-2018.php species\u2019 shells] (see: [[Center for Biological Diversity]] in \"External Links\"). This is likely a combination of the US Fisheries Service choosing not to close the nautilus import market, as well as a lack of understanding on the species\u2019 [[biology]] and their response to fishery pressure. It was not until 2018 that the chambered nautilus was recognized as a [[threatened species]] under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]]. A five-year review has not been conducted, as the chambered nautilus has only been listed for two years. As a result, there have been no listing changes, as the nautilus is still recognized as \u201cthreatened.\u201d \n\nThe practice of shell harvesting largely occurs in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]; however, there is currently a push for more [[Environmental law|environmental-law]] enforcement.<ref>LEMIS. 2016. All import and exports of Nautilus sp. from January 1, 1999 to April 31, 2016. U.S. Fish and Wildlife-Office of Law Enforcement, Arlington, Virginia.</ref> The passing of these environmental laws promises a reduction in the unsustainable harvest of nautilus shells. This is especially important since the chambered nautilus exhibits a slow [[growth rate]] and low [[Reproduction|reproductive]] output. <ref>Saunders, W. B. 1983. Natural rates of growth and longevity of Nautilus belauensis. Paleobiology: 280\u2013288.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe chambered nautilus is considered [[primitive]] when compared to other [[Cephalopod|cephalopods]], such as the [[octopus]] and [[squid]]. One is because of its shell, which is composed of many \u201c[[chambers]],\u201d which increase in number as the [[organism]] [[Mature|matures]] (they have 4 chambers when newly-hatched; up to 40 when fully mature).<ref>Shapiro, E. A., and W. B. Saunders. 2010. Nautilus Shell Hydrostatics. Pages 527\u2013545 in W. B. Saunders and N. H. Landman, editors. Nautilus. Springer Netherlands.</ref> These chambers allow the organism to occupy more space as they grow throughout their [[Life expectancy|lifespan]], which is useful because their shells can reach [[Diameter|diameters]] up to 25 [[Centimetre|centimeters]] when they become fully mature.<ref name=\":1\" /> Their shells, while also offering [[buoyancy]], exhibit [[countershading]], meaning they have a much lighter [[tone]] on the [[inferior]] side.<ref name=\":0\" /> This increases the difficulty for predators to find and [[Consumption|consume]] the [[Cephalopods in popular culture|nautiluses]], as the shading allows them to effectively blend in with their [[environment]]. Unfortunately, their ability to countershade is also the reason why the chambered nautilus is targeted by humans, as there is a high [[economic value]] for their beautiful shells for use in [[Jewellery|jewelry]]. <ref>Aguiar, J. 2000. Nautilus in the Pacific. Tentacle: 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nAnother reason chambered nautiluses are considered [[primitive]] is because of their [[brain]], which lacks the [[neural structures]] found in other cephalopods that support [[learning]].<ref name=\":2\">Crook, R. J., and J. A. Basil. 2013. Flexible Spatial Orientation and Navigational Strategies in Chambered Nautilus. Ethology 119:77\u201385.</ref> However, lab [[Experiment|experiments]] have [[data]] that suggest nautiluses are capable of [[Spatial memory|spatial learning]] and [[Strategy|navigational strategies]], which is important since most of their time is spent in deep, dark water. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Behavior ==\nThe chambered nautilus tends to move to deeper waters (1000-1500 feet) during the daytime, in an effort to avoid [[predation]]. However, at night they ascend to [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] (about 300 feet deep) to hunt for prey.<ref name=\":3\">Kier, W. M. 2010. The Functional Morphology of the Tentacle Musculature of Nautilus pompilius. Pages 257\u2013269 in W. B. Saunders and N. H. Landman, editors. Nautilus Springer Netherlands.</ref> Because of this technique, their [[diet]] consists of [[Organism|organisms]] that dwell in shallow waters, such as [[Fish|small fish]], [[shrimp]] and [[Crab|crabs]]. One of the reasons they hunt at night is because it makes their prey less aware they are being [[Hunting|hunted]].<ref>Ward, P., F. Dooley, and G. J. Barord. 2016. Nautilus: biology, systematics, and paleobiology as viewed from 2015. Swiss Journal of Palaeontology 135: 169\u2013185.</ref> However, this makes it slightly more difficult for the chambered nautilus to [[detect]] its prey, but their tentacles have [[chemosensors]] for this sole purpose<ref>Barord, G. J., F. Dooley, A. Dunstan, A. Ilano, K. N. Keister, H. Neumeister, T. Preuss, S. Schoepfer, and P. D. Ward. 2014. Comparative Population Assessments of Nautilus sp. in the Philippines, Australia, Fiji, and American Samoa Using Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems. DOI: 9:e100799.</ref>. They can detect the [[Odor|scent]] of [[prey]] from a long distance, making it easy for the nautilus to navigate its way to its prey. It is important to note that there is no [[scientific evidence]] for chambered nautiluses hunting in [[Group|groups]]. \n\n=== Life Cycles ===\nThe chambered nautilus\u2019 [[life cycle]] is relatively long compared to other [[Cephalopod|cephalopods]]. It is not uncommon for this nautilus to live at least 15-20 years. <ref>Collins, D., and P. D. Ward. 2010. Adolescent Growth and Maturity in Nautilus. Pages 421\u2013432 in W. B. Saunders and N. H. Landman, editors. Nautilus Springer Netherlands.</ref>However, they do experience a late [[maturity]], not laying a small [[Broodiness|brood]] of eggs until they are about 10-12 years of age.<ref>Landman, N. H., and J. K. Cochran. 2010. Growth and Longevity of Nautilus. Pages 401\u2013420in W. B. Saunders and N. H. Landman, editors. Nautilus Springer Netherlands.</ref> These eggs also require a year-long [[incubation]] period. During this time, offspring are [[vulnerable]] to predation, which results in an extremely-low [[Reproduction|reproductive output]]. \n\n=== Reproduction ===\nAlthough there is not a lot of [[scientific literature]] on the chambered nautilus\u2019 [[Biological life cycle|reproductive cycle]], there are some [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for their [[Mating|mating habits]]. One is that males [[transfer]] [[sperm]] to females through a [[spermatophore]], which contains a mass of [[sperm]] within a [[Coating|protective coating]].<ref>Arnold, J. M. 2010. Reproduction and Embryology of Nautilus. Pages 353\u201337 2in W. B. Saunders and N. H. Landman, editors. Nautilus Springer Netherlands.</ref> This [[Adherens junction|adheres]] to the female nautilus\u2019 [[Mantle cell lymphoma|mantle wall]], where the coating can then [[dissolve]] to [[release]] the sperm. Following this [[Fertilisation|internal fertilization process]], the eggs released require a year-long [[incubation period]]. This, combined with the late-maturity rate of chambered nautiluses, is one of the reasons why the species is [[declining]] dramatically through [[Human-induced climate change|human-induced predation]].<ref name=\":4\">Haven, N. 1977. The reproductive biology of Nautilus pompilius in the Philippines. Marine Biology 42:177\u2013184.</ref> Most of the nautiluses are harvested long before maturity, which prevents them from reproducing, therefore leaving less offspring each generation. \n\n=== Locomotion ===\n[[Locomotion]] is achieved through [[Propulsion|jet-like propulsions]] where the nautilus pulls in water into its [[Seashell|shell\u2019s mantle cavity]] and releases it back through the [[Siphon (mollusc)|muscular siphon]] beneath its [[Tentacle|tentacles]].<ref>Saunders, W. B., and P. D. Ward. 2010. Ecology, Distribution, and Population Characteristics of Nautilus. Pages 137\u2013162 in W. B. Saunders and N. H. Landman, editors. Nautilus. Springer Netherlands.</ref> This [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]] can not only direct the water in multiple directions, providing the nautilus with easy [[maneuverability]], but it also keeps the organism [[Body relative direction|upright]] in the water. \n\n== Habitat and Distribution ==\nChambered nautiluses, in an effort to avoid predation, are commonly found in deep water during the daytime. At night, they [[Migration|migrate]] [[Vertical|vertically]] to [[Shallow|shallower]] waters to hunt for prey.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chambered nautilus is mostly found on the [[Coast|coastal]] areas of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], specifically near [[Coral reef|coral reefs]]. [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] are the sites with the most-common occurrences.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n[[File:Contribution_to_the_natural_history_of_the_pearly_nautilus_(1902)_(20682450302).jpg|thumb|Distribution of Chambered Nautilus]]\nThe chambered nautilus\u2019 first [[Population estimates|population estimate]] was made in 2010, which suggested that there were between 2344 and 4467 [[Individual|individuals]] present. This number has declined in recent years as a result of [[overfishing]]. The current estimates predict that there are between 844 and 2404 individuals present.<ref name=\":5\">Dunstan, A, Bradshaw C.J.A., Marshall, J. (2011) Nautilus at Risk \u2013 Estimating Population Size and Demography of Nautilus pompilius. PLoS ONE 6(2):e16716.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0016716.</ref> It is important to note that both population estimates were dominated by males (83:17). There is no evidence that their [[Geographic range limit|geographic range]] has changed as a result of overfishing, as most sightings occur in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn January 2020, [[NOAA Fisheries]] determined that it was not prudent to designate a [[critical habitat]] for the chambered nautilus. This decision was reached after a [[comprehensive]] review of [[scientific data]]. Also, since the chambered nautilus primarily occurs outside the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[United States]], there would not be a [[Significance|significant]] [[conservation]] value provided.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* NOAA ESA Complaint: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/endangered-species-act-status-review-report-chambered-nautilus\n* CITES Appendix II: https://www.fws.gov/international/cites/index.html\n* CoP17: https://www.fws.gov/international/cites/cop17/index.html\n* Endangered Species Act: https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/\n* Critical Habitat Determination: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/determination-designation-critical-habitat-chambered-nautilus\n* Center for Biological Diversity: https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2018/chambered-nautilus-09-27-2018.php\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of cephalopod}}\n{{Redirect|Nautilus pompilius|the Russian rock band|Nautilus Pompilius (band)}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| fossil_range = [[Early Pleistocene]] to [[Holocene|Recent]]\n| image = Nautilus_side.jpg\n| image_caption = \n| status = VU\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status2 = T\n| status2_system = ESA\n| genus = Nautilus\n| species = pompilius\n| authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]\n| synonyms = *''Nautilus repertus''<br><small>[[Tom Iredale|Iredale]], 1944</small>\n| subdivision_ranks = Subspecies\n| subdivision = *''Nautilus pompilius pompilius''<br><small>[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]</small>\n*''Nautilus pompilius suluensis''<br><small>[[Tadashige Habe|Habe]] & [[Takashi Okutani|Okutani]], 1988</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''chambered nautilus''', '''''Nautilus pompilius''''', also called the '''pearly nautilus''', is the best-known [[species]] of [[nautilus]]. The shell, when cut away, reveals a lining of lustrous [[nacre]] and displays a nearly perfect [[logarithmic spiral|equiangular spiral]], although it is not a [[golden spiral]]. The shell exhibits [[countershading]], being light on the bottom and dark on top. This is to help avoid predators, because when seen from above, it blends in with the darkness of the sea, and when seen from below, it blends in with the light coming from above.\n\nThe range of the chambered nautilus encompasses much of the south Pacific; It has been found near reefs and on the seafloor off of the coasts of Australia, Japan, and Micronesia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe eyes of the chambered nautilus, like those of all ''Nautilus'' species, are more primitive than those of most other [[cephalopod]]s; the eye has no lens and thus is comparable to a [[pinhole camera]].

Small natural history collections were common in mid-19th-century Victorian homes, and chambered nautilus shells were popular decorations.\n\nThe chambered nautilus is the title and subject of a poem by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], in which he admires the \"ship of pearl\" and the \"silent toil/That spread his lustrous coil/Still, as the spiral grew/He left the past year's dwelling for the new.\" He finds in the mysterious life and death of the nautilus strong inspiration for his own life and spiritual growth. He concludes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,\nAs the swift seasons roll!\nLeave thy low-vaulted past!\nLet each new temple, nobler than the last,\nShut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,\nTill thou at length art free,\nLeaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!</poem></blockquote>\n\nA painting by [[Andrew Wyeth]], entitled ''Chambered Nautilus'', shows a woman in a canopied bed; the composition and proportions of the bed and the window behind it mirror those of a chambered nautilus lying on a nearby table.\n\nThe popular [[Russia]]n [[rock band]] [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]] ({{lang-ru|\u041d\u0430\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0443\u0441 \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0443\u0441}}) is named after the species.\n\n[[United States|American]] composer and commentator [[Deems Taylor]] wrote a cantata entitled The Chambered Nautilus in 1916.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Milano - Castello sforzesco - Nautilus su argento cesellato - Germania, sec.

The genus contains a single [[species]], '''''Limusaurus inextricabilis'''''. ''Limusaurus'' was a small, slender animal, about {{convert|1.7|m}} in length, that had a long neck and legs but also highly reduced forelimbs. It underwent a drastic [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] transformation as it aged; while juveniles were toothed, these teeth were completely lost and replaced by a beak with age, corresponding to a shift in diet from an [[omnivore|omnivory]] feeding strategy to an [[herbivore|herbivory]] one. Its fossils were discovered in rocks of the [[Shishugou Formation|Upper Shishugou Formation]] in the [[Junggar Basin]], and date to the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] age, around 161&nbsp;to 157&nbsp;million years ago.\n\n''Limusaurus'' is the first definitively known member of the group [[Ceratosauria]] from Eastern Asia. While originally considered the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member (i.e. closest to the origin) along with its closest relative, ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', a 2016 analysis showed that both genera are in fact members of the [[Noasauridae]], a group of small and lightly built [[abelisaur]]s. The pattern of digit reduction in ''Limusaurus'' has been used to support the contested hypothesis that the three-fingered hand of [[tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods is the result of the loss of the first and fifth digits from the ancestral five-fingered theropod hand, which has implications for the [[evolution of birds]]. However, it is now considered irrelevant to the subject of digit [[homology (biology)|homology]].\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Limusaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Holotype and assigned specimen (upper right) exhibited in Tokyo]]\n''Limusaurus'' was described in a 2009 paper authored by [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] and colleagues in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association, which are both stored at the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] (IVPP) in [[Beijing]]: the [[holotype]] (specimen number IVPP&nbsp;V&nbsp;15923) is an almost complete and {{Dinogloss|articulated}} (still connected) skeleton, and the other (IVPP&nbsp;V&nbsp;15304) is a likewise almost complete and articulated specimen that is missing only the skull. The second specimen is 15% larger than the holotype. These specimens have also been referred to respectively by the erroneous specimen numbers IVPP&nbsp;V&nbsp;15924 and IVPP&nbsp;V&nbsp;16134.<ref name=\"xu2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = X. | last2 = Clark | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Mo | first3 = J. | last4 = Choiniere | first4 = J. | last5 = Forster | first5 = C.A. | last6 = Erickson | first6 = G.M. | last7 = Hone | first7 = D.W.E. | last8 = Sullivan | first8 = C. | last9 = Eberth | first9 = D.A. | last10 = Nesbitt | first10 = S. | last11 = Zhao | first11 = Q. | last12 = Hernandez | first12 = R. | last13 = Jia | first13 = C.-K. | last14 = Han | first14 = F.-L. | last15 = Guo | first15 = Y. | date = 2009 | title = A Jurassic ceratosaur from China helps clarify avian digital homologies | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 459 | issue = 18 | pages = 940\u2013944 | doi = 10.1038/nature08124 | pmid = 19536256 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..940X | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/209594/files/PAL_E4066.pdf }}</ref><ref name=\"onto\"/> Both the genus name, ''Limusaurus'' (meaning \"mud lizard\"), and the name of the [[type species]], ''L. inextricabilis'' (meaning \"impossible to extricate\"), refer to how the known specimens appeared to have died and become preserved after being mired in mud pits.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\nSeventeen additional specimens were described in 2016.

The overall aspect of the animal, including the long neck and legs, was very similar to that of the [[Cretaceous]] [[ornithomimid]] theropods, as well as the [[Triassic]] non-dinosaurian [[archosaur]] ''[[Effigia]]'', representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\n===Skull===\nThe skull was tall and short, roughly half the length of the [[femur]] (upper thigh bone). The tip of its jaws was covered by a [[beak]], a feature that was previously unknown in theropods more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (or \"primitive\") than [[coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], the group that includes the most bird-like dinosaurs. Juveniles had nine teeth in each side of the upper jaw, and twelve in each side of the lower; they were gradually lost as they grew, disappearing by adulthood. As in most dinosaurs, the skull featured five principal [[fenestra]]e (openings), including the {{Dinogloss|bony nostril}}, [[Orbit|eye opening]], [[antorbital fenestra]] (between the nostril and eye), as well as the {{Dinogloss|upper temporal fenestra|upper}} and {{Dinogloss|lower temporal fenestra}} (on the top and on the side of the skull's rear, respectively). As in other ceratosaurians, parts of the bony nostril were formed by the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw bone); also, the antorbital fenestra was proportionally small, and the rear part of the [[nasal bone]] formed parts of the cavity which contained this opening. The eye opening was large, while the lateral temporal fenestra was not as large as would be expected from more derived members of the Ceratosauria. Another opening, the {{Dinogloss|mandibular fenestra}} of the lower jaw, was generally large in ceratosaurians. In ''Limusaurus'', it was especially large, accounting for 40% of the length of the entire lower jaw, which serves as an [[autapomorphy]] (distinguishing feature) for the genus. The {{Dinogloss|dentary}} (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) was short compared to the rest of the lower jaw, as in other ceratosaurians.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/><ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\nA number of skull features are unique to ''Limusaurus'' and thus serve as [[Autapomorphy |autapomorphies]]: The inner edge of the [[premaxilla]], the frontmost bone of the upper jaw, was convex. The nasal bone had a \"shelf\" on its side, was short, wide, less than one third of the length of the {{Dinogloss|skull roof}}, and twice as long as it was wide. The lower part of the [[Lacrimal bone|lacrimal]], the bone that formed the front margin of the eye opening, was strongly inclined forwards. The [[jugal bone]], which formed the floor of the eye opening, was slender, and its rami (or branches) were rod like.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/><ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Limusaurus inextricabilis.jpg|thumb|{{Center|[[Life restoration]]}}]]\nThe {{Dinogloss|cervicals}} (neck vertebrae) were elongated as in the closely related ''Elaphrosaurus''. The [[axis (anatomy)|axis]] (second neck vertebra) lacked the {{Dinogloss|pleurocoel}} (excavation) on its front end and the [[Foramen|foramina]] (openings) piercing its [[neural arch]] that are seen in derived ceratosaurians. As in other noasaurids, the [[neural spine]]s of the cervicals were positioned more towards the front end of their vertebrae than is the case in other theropods.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\nDistinctively, the [[scapula]] (shoulder blade) bore a prominent ridge at its front edge. It also had a comparatively high {{Dinogloss|acromion process}}. The [[sternum]] was fused into a single, large, continuous plate, another feature that evolved independently in coelurosaurs ([[convergent evolution]]). ''Limusaurus'' also had a [[furcula]], or wishbone, which previously was unknown among ceratosaurians. The head of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was bulging, and the {{Dinogloss|deltopectoral crest}}, a forward-directed bony flange of the humerus that served for muscle attachment, was long and angled; these features were typical for ceratosaurians. In the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]] was longer than the [[ulna]], and the {{Dinogloss|olecranon process}}, a bony extension on the upper end of the ulna that served for muscle attachment, was absent in ''Limusaurus''. Both features are considered autapomorphies of the genus. As in other ceratosaurians, [[Ossification|ossified]] [[carpal bones|wrist bones]] were absent.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\nAs is typical for [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurids]], the arms and hands of ''Limusaurus'' were considerably reduced, even more so than in ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''. Uniquely in ''Limusaurus'', the first finger was missing entirely, and the first [[metacarpal]] was shorter than the other metacarpals.

\nAnalysis of growth rings (visible in bone cross-sections and analogous to the [[Dendrochronology#Growth_rings|growth rings of trees]]) of the tibiae from the various [[Ontogeny|developmental stages]] of ''Limusaurus'' indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost growth rings are very close together (forming what is known as the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.<ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\nSpecimens of ''Limusaurus'' show 78 different anatomical changes that occurred as the animals grew. In particular, their heads become shallower, their middle [[metacarpal bones|hand bones]] lengthened, and the \"hook\" of their pubis grew longer. Additionally, the shaft of the [[quadrate bone]] in the skull straightened in adults, and the tips of their lower jaws became more downturned.<ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\nThe most obvious change that happened during the growth of ''Limusaurus'' is the complete loss of teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth in total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, use of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any wear marks or [[tooth resorption|resorption]]. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all the teeth are missing. [[CT scan]]ning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, and the rest of the tooth sockets have been obliterated.<ref name=\"onto\"/>\n[[File:Limusaurus runner.jpg|thumb|{{Center|Restoration of a toothless adult}}]]\nThe loss of teeth with age in ''Limusaurus'' is the most extreme case of tooth morphology changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, ''Limusaurus'' is one of the only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during growth (the others are the [[Mullus barbatus|red mullet]] and [[striped red mullet]], several [[callichthyidae|armored catfish]], and the [[platypus]]).

These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that ''Limusaurus'' did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to process plant matter more finely as they aged. An [[isotope analysis]] of the available specimens of ''Limusaurus'' specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs.

The genus contains a single [[species]], '''''Limusaurus inextricabilis'''''. ''Limusaurus'' was a small, slender animal, about {{convert|1.7|m}} in length, that had a long neck and legs but also highly reduced forelimbs. It underwent a drastic [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] transformation as it aged; while juveniles were toothed, these teeth were completely lost and replaced by a beak with age, corresponding to a shift in diet from an [[omnivore|omnivory]] feeding strategy to an [[herbivore|herbivory]] one. Its fossils were discovered in rocks of the [[Shishugou Formation|Upper Shishugou Formation]] in the [[Junggar Basin]], and date to the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] age, around 161&nbsp;to 157&nbsp;million years ago.\n\n''Limusaurus'' is the first definitively known member of the group [[Ceratosauria]] from Eastern Asia. While originally considered the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member (i.e. closest to the origin) along with its closest relative, ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', a 2016 analysis showed that both genera are in fact members of the [[Noasauridae]], a group of small and lightly built [[abelisaur]]s. The pattern of digit reduction in ''Limusaurus'' has been used to support the contested hypothesis that the three-fingered hand of [[tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods is the result of the loss of the first and fifth digits from the ancestral five-fingered theropod hand, which has implications for the [[evolution of birds]]. However, it is now considered irrelevant to the subject of digit [[homology (biology)|homology]].\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Limusaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Holotype and assigned specimen (upper right) exhibited in Tokyo]]\n''Limusaurus'' was described in a 2009 paper authored by [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] and colleagues in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association, which are both stored at the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] (IVPP) in [[Beijing]]: the [[holotype]] (specimen number IVPP&nbsp;V&nbsp;15923) is an almost complete and {{Dinogloss|articulated}} (still connected) skeleton, and the other (IVPP&nbsp;V&nbsp;15304) is a likewise almost complete and articulated specimen that is missing only the skull. The second specimen is 15% larger than the holotype.

The overall aspect of the animal, including the long neck and legs, was very similar to that of the [[Cretaceous]] [[ornithomimid]] theropods, as well as the [[Triassic]] non-dinosaurian [[archosaur]] ''[[Effigia]]'', representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\n===Skull===\nThe skull was tall and short, roughly half the length of the [[femur]] (upper thigh bone). The tip of its jaws was covered by a [[beak]], a feature that was previously unknown in theropods more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (or \"primitive\") than [[coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], the group that includes the most bird-like dinosaurs. Juveniles had nine teeth in each side of the upper jaw, and twelve in each side of the lower; they were gradually lost as they grew, disappearing by adulthood. As in most dinosaurs, the skull featured five principal [[fenestra]]e (openings), including the {{Dinogloss|bony nostril}}, [[Orbit|eye opening]], [[antorbital fenestra]] (between the nostril and eye), as well as the {{Dinogloss|upper temporal fenestra|upper}} and {{Dinogloss|lower temporal fenestra}} (on the top and on the side of the skull's rear, respectively). As in other ceratosaurians, parts of the bony nostril were formed by the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw bone); also, the antorbital fenestra was proportionally small, and the rear part of the [[nasal bone]] formed parts of the cavity which contained this opening. The eye opening was large, while the lateral temporal fenestra was not as large as would be expected from more derived members of the Ceratosauria. Another opening, the {{Dinogloss|mandibular fenestra}} of the lower jaw, was generally large in ceratosaurians. In ''Limusaurus'', it was especially large, accounting for 40% of the length of the entire lower jaw, which serves as an [[autapomorphy]] (distinguishing feature) for the genus. The {{Dinogloss|dentary}} (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) was short compared to the rest of the lower jaw, as in other ceratosaurians.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/><ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\nA number of skull features are unique to ''Limusaurus'' and thus serve as [[Autapomorphy |autapomorphies]]: The inner edge of the [[premaxilla]], the frontmost bone of the upper jaw, was convex. The nasal bone had a \"shelf\" on its side, was short, wide, less than one third of the length of the {{Dinogloss|skull roof}}, and twice as long as it was wide. The lower part of the [[Lacrimal bone|lacrimal]], the bone that formed the front margin of the eye opening, was strongly inclined forwards. The [[jugal bone]], which formed the floor of the eye opening, was slender, and its rami (or branches) were rod like.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/><ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Limusaurus inextricabilis.jpg|thumb|{{Center|[[Life restoration]]}}]]\nThe {{Dinogloss|cervicals}} (neck vertebrae) were elongated as in the closely related ''Elaphrosaurus''. The [[axis (anatomy)|axis]] (second neck vertebra) lacked the {{Dinogloss|pleurocoel}} (excavation) on its front end and the [[Foramen|foramina]] (openings) piercing its [[neural arch]] that are seen in derived ceratosaurians. As in other noasaurids, the [[neural spine]]s of the cervicals were positioned more towards the front end of their vertebrae than is the case in other theropods.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\nDistinctively, the [[scapula]] (shoulder blade) bore a prominent ridge at its front edge. It also had a comparatively high {{Dinogloss|acromion process}}. The [[sternum]] was fused into a single, large, continuous plate, another feature that evolved independently in coelurosaurs ([[convergent evolution]]). ''Limusaurus'' also had a [[furcula]], or wishbone, which previously was unknown among ceratosaurians. The head of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was bulging, and the {{Dinogloss|deltopectoral crest}}, a forward-directed bony flange of the humerus that served for muscle attachment, was long and angled; these features were typical for ceratosaurians. In the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]] was longer than the [[ulna]], and the {{Dinogloss|olecranon process}}, a bony extension on the upper end of the ulna that served for muscle attachment, was absent in ''Limusaurus''. Both features are considered autapomorphies of the genus. As in other ceratosaurians, [[Ossification|ossified]] [[carpal bones|wrist bones]] were absent.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\nAs is typical for [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurids]], the arms and hands of ''Limusaurus'' were considerably reduced, even more so than in ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''. Uniquely in ''Limusaurus'', the first finger was missing entirely, and the first [[metacarpal]] was shorter than the other metacarpals. The second metacarpal was more robust than the other metacarpals, which is another autapomorphy of the genus. The second finger had three [[Phalanx bone|phalanges]] (finger bones). The third finger only had three phalanges as opposed to four in other early theropods. Although the fourth finger is not preserved, the tip of the fourth metacarpal indicates the presence of a [[joint (anatomy)|joint]] and therefore the presence of a phalanx; it is likely that this was the only phalanx of the fourth finger.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/><ref name=\"terato\">{{cite journal | first1 = G. | last1 = Guinard | title = ''Limusaurus inextricabilis'' (Theropoda: Ceratosauria) gives a hand to evolutionary teratology: a complementary view on avian manual digits identities | journal = [[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] | volume = 176 | date = 2016 | pages = 674\u2013685 | doi = 10.1111/zoj.12329 | issue = 3| doi-access = free }}</ref> The {{Dinogloss|unguals}} (claw bones) were short, stout, and expanded at their base.<ref name=\"unguals\">{{cite journal | first1 = F.L. | last1 = Agnolin | first2 = P. | last2 = Chiarelli | title = The position of the claws in Noasauridae (Dinosauria: Abelisauroidea) and its implications for abelisauroid manus evolution | journal = [[Pal\u00e4ontologische Zeitschrift]] | date = 2010 | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 293\u2013300 | doi = 10.1007/s12542-009-0044-2}}</ref> They had two grooves on their sides, a feature also found in the related ''[[Masiakasaurus]]''.<ref name=\"xu2009\"/>\n\nOf the [[pelvis]], the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] was small and tilted towards the midline of the body, as is the case in ''Elaphrosaurus''. As in other ceratosaurians, the lower end (\"boot\") of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] was large and expanded. Unique for the genus, it pointed backwards in a hook-like shape and had a ridge on each side. The legs of ''Limusaurus'' had proportions that were well-adapted to running, with their lower segments much longer than the femur: the [[tibiotarsus]], the fusion of the [[tibia]] (shin bone) and [[tarsal bones]], was 1.2 times the length of the femur, and the foot was 1.3 times the length of the femur. The upper half of the femur was triangular in cross section, a feature shared with ''Masiakasaurus''. The [[metatarsal bones|metatarsals]] of the other three toes were arranged in an arc, with the fourth metatarsal straight and adhering tightly to the third for its entire length; these features are unique to ''Limusaurus''. Another unique feature, the [[Toe#Hallux|hallux]] (the first toe) was reduced, being only 17% the length of the third metatarsal.

\nAnalysis of growth rings (visible in bone cross-sections and analogous to the [[Dendrochronology#Growth_rings|growth rings of trees]]) of the tibiae from the various [[Ontogeny|developmental stages]] of ''Limusaurus'' indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost growth rings are very close together (forming what is known as the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.<ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\nSpecimens of ''Limusaurus'' show 78 different anatomical changes that occurred as the animals grew. In particular, their heads become shallower, their middle [[metacarpal bones|hand bones]] lengthened, and the \"hook\" of their pubis grew longer. Additionally, the shaft of the [[quadrate bone]] in the skull straightened in adults, and the tips of their lower jaws became more downturned.<ref name=\"onto\"/>\n\nThe most obvious change that happened during the growth of ''Limusaurus'' is the complete loss of teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth in total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, use of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any wear marks or [[tooth resorption|resorption]]. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all the teeth are missing. [[CT scan]]ning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, and the rest of the tooth sockets have been obliterated.<ref name=\"onto\"/>\n[[File:Limusaurus runner.jpg|thumb|{{Center|Restoration of a toothless adult}}]]\nThe loss of teeth with age in ''Limusaurus'' is the most extreme case of tooth morphology changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, ''Limusaurus'' is one of the only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during growth (the others are the [[Mullus barbatus|red mullet]] and [[striped red mullet]], several [[callichthyidae|armored catfish]], and the [[platypus]]).

These pits range in depth from {{convert|1|-|2|m}}, and were likely created by [[soil liquefaction]] from the footsteps of sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages can be attributed to the tendency of smaller animals to become [[Shishugou Formation dinosaur traps|trapped]] in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of ''Guanlong'', along with small [[ornithischian]]s, [[crocodyliforms]], turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid [[cynodont]]s), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of ''Limusaurus''.
