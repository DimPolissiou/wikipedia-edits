Chaplin made 14 short comedies for Essanay in 1915, at both the Chicago and Niles studios, plus a cameo appearance in one of the Broncho Billy westerns. Chaplin's Essanays are more disciplined than the chaotic roughhouse of Chaplin's Keystones, with better story values and character development. The landmark film of the Chaplin series is ''The Tramp'' (1915),<ref>{{cite web | url = https://silentlocations.com/2016/10/16/chaplins-the-tramp-new-views-of-one-of-cinemas-most-iconic-scenes/ | title = Chaplin\u2019s The Tramp \u2013 \u2018New\u2019 Views of One of Cinema\u2019s Most Iconic Scenes | accessdate = 15 April 2020 | date = 16 October 2016 | work = Silent Locations}}</ref> in which Chaplin's vagabond character finds work on a farm and is smitten with the farmer's daughter. Chaplin injected moments of drama and pathos unheard of in slapstick comedies (the tramp is felled by a gunshot wound, and then disappointed in romance). The film ends with the famous shot of the lonely tramp with his back to the camera, walking down the road dejectedly, and then squaring his shoulders optimistically and heading for his next adventure. Audiences responded to the humanity of Chaplin's character, and Chaplin continued to explore serious or sentimental themes within comic situations.\n\nAttempting to capitalize on the popularity of Chaplin, the studio in 1915 had its cartoon character Dreamy Dud in a Chaplin themed short ''Dreamy Dud Sees Charlie Chaplin'' in which Dud watches a Chaplin short.<ref>Kevin Scott Collier.

Cartoon Research (May 20, 2019).</ref>\n\nChaplin's stock company at Essanay included [[Ben Turpin]], who disliked working with the meticulous Chaplin and appeared with him in only a couple of films; ingenue [[Edna Purviance]], who became his off-screen sweetheart as well; [[Leo White]], almost always playing a fussy continental villain; and all-purpose authority figures [[Bud Jamison]] and [[John Rand (actor)|John Rand]].\n\nChaplin disliked the unpredictable weather of Chicago and left after only one year for more money and more creative control elsewhere. His departure caused a rift between founders Spoor and Anderson. Chaplin was the studio's biggest moneymaker, and Essanay resorted to creating \"new\" Chaplin comedies from file footage and out-takes. Finally, with Chaplin off the Essanay scene for good, Essanay signed French comedian [[Max Linder]], whose clever pantomime, often compared to Chaplin's, failed to match Chaplin's popularity in America.\n\n==V-L-S-E, Incorporated==\nIn 1915, the Essanay entered into an agreement, in a last-ditch effort to save the studio, with [[Vitagraph Studios]], [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]], and [[Selig Polyscope Company]] to form a film distribution partnership known as [[Vitagraph Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyOhBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=V-L-S-E|title=The Movies in the Age of Innocence, 3d ed.|first=Edward|last=Wagenknecht|date=13 October 2014|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=9 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> It was orchestrated by Chicago distributor [[George Kleine]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Only the Vitagraph brand name continued into the 1920s, and was absorbed by [[Warner Brothers]] in 1925.\n\n==Final years==\nGeorge K. Spoor continued to work in the motion picture industry, introducing an unsuccessful [[3-D film|3-D]] system in 1923,<ref>\"Natural Vision Picture\", ''The New York Times'', August 21, 1923, p. 6.</ref> and Spoor-Berggren Natural Vision, a 65&nbsp;mm [[widescreen]] format, in 1930. He died in Chicago in 1953. G. M. Anderson became an independent producer, sponsoring [[Stan Laurel]] in a series of silent comedies. Anderson died in Los Angeles in 1971.\n\nThe Essanay building in Chicago was later taken over by independent producer Norman Wilding, who made industrial films. Wilding's tenancy was much longer than Essanay's. In the early 1970s, a portion of the studio was offered to Columbia College (Chicago) for a dollar but the offer lapsed without action. Then it was given to a non-profit television corporation which sold it. One tenant was the midwest office of Technicolor. Today the Essanay lot is the home of [[St. Augustine College (Chicago)|St. Augustine's College]], and its main meeting hall has been named the Charlie Chaplin Auditorium.<ref name=\"mcnulty\">{{cite book | last = McNulty | first = Elizabeth | authorlink = Elizabeth McNulty | title = Chicago: Then and Now | publisher = Thunder Bay Press | date = 2000 | pages = 121 | isbn = 1-57145-278-8}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chicago film industry]]\n* [[Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* David Kiehn, ''Broncho Billy and the Essanay Film Company'', Farwell Books, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-9729226-5-4}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://essanaystudios.org/ Essanaystudios.org: Official '''Essanay Studios''' landmarks website]\n* [http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/ Nilesfilmmuseum.org: Niles\u2212Essanay Silent Film Museum] \u2014 ''at Essanay Studios West, located in [[Fremont, California#Niles District|Niles Canyon]], East San Francisco Bay Area, California.''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090318093744/http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/S%26A_story.htm Nilesfilmmuseum.org: \"Story of Essanay Studios in Niles\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070606043823/http://magnoliamaldenneighbors.com/entertainment.html History TV: \"An animated history of Essanay Studios] \u2014 ''detailed history and extensive filmography.\n* \"[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2007/Reel-Chicago/ Chicago Magazine.com: \"Reel Chicago\" (May 2007)] \u2014 ''by Robert Loerzel''.\n\n{{Chicago Landmark cultural venues}}\n{{coord|41.972565|N|87.6638|W|region:US-IL_type:landmark_scale:30000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1907]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 1918]]\n[[Category:Essanay Studios films| ]]\n[[Category:Silent film studios]]\n[[Category:Defunct American film studios]]\n[[Category:Film distributors of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Fremont, California]]\n[[Category:Cinema of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Cinema of Southern California]]\n[[Category:Defunct media companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Greater Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in California]]<!--Hollywood & Niles Canyon-->\n[[Category:1918 disestablishments in California]]\n[[Category:Chicago Landmarks]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American film production company}}\n[[File:Essanay logo.jpg|thumb|300px|Essanay Film Manufacturing Company logo in a still frame from a Charlie Chaplin film]]\nThe '''Essanay Film Manufacturing Company''' was an American [[film|motion picture]] [[movie studio|studio]].

This included locations in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], just outside San Francisco, and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].  Essanay opened the Essanay-West studio in [[Niles, California]], in 1912, at the foot of [[Niles Canyon]], where many Broncho Billy westerns were shot, along with [[The Tramp (film)|''The Tramp'']] featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The Chicago studio, as well as the new Niles studio, continued to produce films for another five years, reaching a total of well over 1,400 Essanay titles during its ten-year history.\n\n==Chaplin==\n[[File:Essanay Stars 1915.jpg|thumb|Essanay's stars in 1915: [[Francis X. Bushman]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and studio co-owner and actor [[Broncho Billy Anderson]].]]\nIn late 1914, Essanay succeeded in hiring Charlie Chaplin away from [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]], offering Chaplin a higher salary and his own production unit. Chaplin made 14 short comedies for Essanay in 1915, at both the Chicago and Niles studios, plus a cameo appearance in one of the Broncho Billy westerns. Chaplin's Essanays are more disciplined than the chaotic roughhouse of Chaplin's Keystones, with better story values and character development. The landmark film of the Chaplin series is ''The Tramp'' (1915),<ref>{{cite web | url = https://silentlocations.com/2016/10/16/chaplins-the-tramp-new-views-of-one-of-cinemas-most-iconic-scenes/ | title = Chaplin\u2019s The Tramp \u2013 \u2018New\u2019 Views of One of Cinema\u2019s Most Iconic Scenes | accessdate = 15 April 2020 | date = 16 October 2016 | work = Silent Locations}}</ref> in which Chaplin's vagabond character finds work on a farm and is smitten with the farmer's daughter. Chaplin injected moments of drama and pathos unheard of in slapstick comedies (the tramp is felled by a gunshot wound, and then disappointed in romance). The film ends with the famous shot of the lonely tramp with his back to the camera, walking down the road dejectedly, and then squaring his shoulders optimistically and heading for his next adventure. Audiences responded to the humanity of Chaplin's character, and Chaplin continued to explore serious or sentimental themes within comic situations.\n\nAttempting to capitalize on the popularity of Chaplin, the studio in 1915 had its cartoon character Dreamy Dud in a Chaplin themed short ''Dreamy Dud Sees Charlie Chaplin'' in which Dud watches a Chaplin short.<ref>Kevin Scott Collier.

Cartoon Research (May 20, 2019).</ref>\n\nChaplin's stock company at Essanay included [[Ben Turpin]], who disliked working with the meticulous Chaplin and appeared with him in only a couple of films; ingenue [[Edna Purviance]], who became his off-screen sweetheart as well; [[Leo White]], almost always playing a fussy continental villain; and all-purpose authority figures [[Bud Jamison]] and [[John Rand (actor)|John Rand]].\n\nChaplin disliked the unpredictable weather of Chicago and left after only one year for more money and more creative control elsewhere. His departure caused a rift between founders Spoor and Anderson. Chaplin was the studio's biggest moneymaker, and Essanay resorted to creating \"new\" Chaplin comedies from file footage and out-takes. Finally, with Chaplin off the Essanay scene for good, Essanay signed French comedian [[Max Linder]], whose clever pantomime, often compared to Chaplin's, failed to match Chaplin's popularity in America.\n\n==V-L-S-E, Incorporated==\nIn 1915, the Essanay entered into an agreement, in a last-ditch effort to save the studio, with [[Vitagraph Studios]], [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]], and [[Selig Polyscope Company]] to form a film distribution partnership known as [[Vitagraph_Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyOhBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=V-L-S-E|title=The Movies in the Age of Innocence, 3d ed.|first=Edward|last=Wagenknecht|date=13 October 2014|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=9 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> It was orchestrated by Chicago distributor [[George Kleine]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} Only the Vitagraph brand name continued into the 1920s, and was absorbed by [[Warner Brothers]] in 1925.\n\n==Final years==\nGeorge K. Spoor continued to work in the motion picture industry, introducing an unsuccessful [[3-D film|3-D]] system in 1923,<ref>\"Natural Vision Picture\", ''The New York Times'', August 21, 1923, p. 6.</ref> and Spoor-Berggren Natural Vision, a 65&nbsp;mm [[widescreen]] format, in 1930. He died in Chicago in 1953. G. M. Anderson became an independent producer, sponsoring [[Stan Laurel]] in a series of silent comedies. Anderson died in Los Angeles in 1971.\n\nThe Essanay building in Chicago was later taken over by independent producer Norman Wilding, who made industrial films. Wilding's tenancy was much longer than Essanay's. In the early 1970s, a portion of the studio was offered to Columbia College (Chicago) for a dollar but the offer lapsed without action. Then it was given to a non-profit television corporation which sold it. One tenant was the midwest office of Technicolor. Today the Essanay lot is the home of [[St. Augustine College (Chicago)|St. Augustine's College]], and its main meeting hall has been named the Charlie Chaplin Auditorium.<ref name=\"mcnulty\">{{cite book | last = McNulty | first = Elizabeth | authorlink = Elizabeth McNulty | title = Chicago: Then and Now | publisher = Thunder Bay Press | date = 2000 | pages = 121 | isbn = 1-57145-278-8}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chicago film industry]]\n* [[Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* David Kiehn, ''Broncho Billy and the Essanay Film Company'', Farwell Books, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-9729226-5-4}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://essanaystudios.org/ Essanaystudios.org: Official '''Essanay Studios''' landmarks website]\n* [http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/ Nilesfilmmuseum.org: Niles\u2212Essanay Silent Film Museum] \u2014 ''at Essanay Studios West, located in [[Fremont, California#Niles District|Niles Canyon]], East San Francisco Bay Area, California.''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090318093744/http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/S%26A_story.htm Nilesfilmmuseum.org: \"Story of Essanay Studios in Niles\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070606043823/http://magnoliamaldenneighbors.com/entertainment.html History TV: \"An animated history of Essanay Studios] \u2014 ''detailed history and extensive filmography.\n* \"[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2007/Reel-Chicago/ Chicago Magazine.com: \"Reel Chicago\" (May 2007)] \u2014 ''by Robert Loerzel''.\n\n{{Chicago Landmark cultural venues}}\n{{coord|41.972565|N|87.6638|W|region:US-IL_type:landmark_scale:30000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1907]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 1918]]\n[[Category:Essanay Studios films| ]]\n[[Category:Silent film studios]]\n[[Category:Defunct American film studios]]\n[[Category:Film distributors of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Fremont, California]]\n[[Category:Cinema of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Cinema of Southern California]]\n[[Category:Defunct media companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Greater Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in California]]<!--Hollywood & Niles Canyon-->\n[[Category:1918 disestablishments in California]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essanay_Studios"}

It was a large railroad shipping point for cattle destined for the Baltimore markets and after a bank was founded in 1910 became the financial center for both North Codorus and Springfield Townships.\n\nThe [[Bridge 5+92, Northern Central Railway]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n[[File:7 Valleys PA RR bridge from S.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Northern Central Railroad]] bridge over Main Street]]\n\n==Geography==\nSeven Valleys is located at {{coord|39|51|22|N|76|46|1|W|type:city}} (39.855975, -76.766920).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.1|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 428\n|1910= 365\n|1920= 384\n|1930= 405\n|1940= 398\n|1950= 437\n|1960= 515\n|1970= 688\n|1980= 500\n|1990= 483\n|2000= 492\n|2010= 517\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=512\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 492 people, 188 households, and 134 families residing in the borough.

Police agencies involved in the chase included the San Diego police, the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department]], the [[California Highway Patrol]], and due to the tank being stolen from the armory, possibly [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] as well. The tank had a top speed of {{convert|30|mph}}, making the chase slow compared to police chases involving automobiles.

In addition to the open, unguarded gate to the vehicle lot, the fence surrounding the lot had damaged [[barbed wire]] in some places. Residents near the armory said that even if the gate had been locked, Nelson could have simply climbed the fence in sections where the barbed wire was damaged. \n\nArmory officials said that only a few people were given keys to the vehicles, that the vehicles were kept far away from fences to make them difficult to reach, that only someone with the proper knowledge could operate and even start a tank, and that there was just no way to foresee such an event taking place.

On one occasion, he dug a hole {{convert|15|ft|m}} deep in his backyard in an attempt to mine for [[gold]].<ref name=latimes1>{{cite news |last1=Rotella |first1=Sebastian |first2=Chris |last2=Kraul |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-19-mn-3459-story.html |title=Tank's Driver Beset by Drug, Money Problems |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 19, 1995 |accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> One of his friends, Carson Honings, referred to the [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] as Nelson's \"new hobby\".

Whether Nelson condoned the attack or simply meant that he enjoyed the drama was not clear. Police did not believe that Nelson had any connection with the bombing or with a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group.\n\nAt dusk, approximately 6:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=latimes1/> on Wednesday, May 17, 1995, Nelson drove his [[Chevrolet]] van to the [[California Army National Guard]] [[armory (military)|Armory]] on Mesa College Boulevard to the [[Kearny Mesa, San Diego|Kearny Mesa]] neighborhood of San Diego. Employees at the armory were working late and the gate to the vehicle yard, which was completely deserted, was left open.\n\n[[File:American M60A3 tank Lake Charles, Louisiana April 2005.jpg|thumb|left|alt=M60A3 Patton on display in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in April 2005|An M60A3 Patton (the same type of tank Nelson drove) on display in April 2005]]\nThe tanks at the armory started with a push button and did not require an ignition key. The first two tanks Nelson broke into would not start. As he lowered himself into the third tank, a 57-ton [[M60 Patton|M60A3 Patton]], he was finally noticed by a guardsman, who approached the tank. Nelson started the vehicle, and with little chance of stopping him, the guardsman rushed to a phone and called the police. As [[ammunition]] was kept in another building, none of the vehicle's weapons could be loaded or used by Nelson.<ref name=nyt1/>\n\nNelson led police on a 23-minute, televised chase through the streets of Clairemont. Police agencies involved in the chase included the San Diego police, the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department]], the [[California Highway Patrol]], and due to the tank being stolen from the armory, possibly [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] as well. The tank had a top speed of {{convert|30|mph}}, making the chase slow compared to police chases involving automobiles. The 57-ton tank easily plowed through road signs, traffic lights, utility poles, fire hydrants, and crushed approximately forty parked vehicles, including an [[Recreational Vehicle|RV]].<ref name=UPI95/> The damage to utility poles knocked out power to at least 5,100 [[San Diego Gas & Electric]] customers in the [[Linda Vista, San Diego|Linda Vista]] neighborhood.<ref name=AP95>{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/75f6f9ed03c279b8adbcafcd108a3c86 |title=Police Kill Man Who Hijacked Tank |author=Fordahl, Matthew |date=May 18, 1995 |work=AP News |accessdate=28 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628200023/https://apnews.com/75f6f9ed03c279b8adbcafcd108a3c86 |archive-date=28 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFrom the armory, Nelson traveled along neighborhood streets, eventually turning north on Convoy Street, west on to Balboa Avenue (then signed as [[California State Route 274|State Route 274]]), and entered [[Interstate 805]] heading south.<ref name=UT95/> While on I-805, he attempted to knock down a pedestrian bridge by running into the pillars, but failed after a few hits, and decided to continue onto the freeway.

San Diego Police officer Paul Paxton, a [[gunnery sergeant]] at the time with the [[Marine Corps Reserve]], opened the hatch using [[bolt cutter]]s.

Despite the widespread property destruction, he was the only fatality reported during the rampage.\n\n===Police action===\nQuestions were raised as to whether it was necessary for the police to kill Nelson. Police Captain Tom Hall said that if Nelson had managed to free the tank, he \"could have taken out no less than 35 vehicles that were passing at that moment.\"<ref name=nyt1/> Police decided that if non-lethal action such as [[tear gas]] were used, this might have stopped Nelson, but not the tank, and officers would not be able to enter the tank if it were still mobile with tear gas present. According to live news coverage at the time, officials were seriously considering asking for help from the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] at [[Camp Pendleton]] in the form of a [[Bell AH-1 Cobra]] [[attack helicopter]], as the police force lacked the means for disabling a tank.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://medium.com/of-misdeeds-and-mysteries/the-tank-rampage-of-san-diego-1995-1f8a97a0a30c|title=San Diego\u2019s 1995 Tank Rampage {{!}} Case Closed #2|last=Nicole Henley|date=2019-07-23|work=Medium|access-date=2019-11-28|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128172247/https://medium.com/of-misdeeds-and-mysteries/the-tank-rampage-of-san-diego-1995-1f8a97a0a30c|archive-date=2019-11-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Scott Nelson, when asked, stated that police were justified in shooting his brother.<ref name=latimes1/>\n\n==Armory security==\nOfficials at the armory where Nelson stole the tank were criticized for what appeared to be a huge lapse in security, especially after the attack in Oklahoma City the previous month. In addition to the open, unguarded gate to the vehicle lot, the fence surrounding the lot had damaged [[barbed wire]] in some places. Residents near the armory said that even if the gate had been locked, Nelson could have simply climbed the fence in sections where the barbed wire was damaged. \n\nArmory officials said that only a few people were given keys to the vehicles, that the vehicles were kept far away from fences to make them difficult to reach, that only someone with the proper knowledge could operate and even start a tank, and that there was just no way to foresee such an event taking place. After Nelson's theft of the tank, security was tightened at the Kearny Mesa armory.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/21/us/theft-of-tank-raises-questions-about-the-security-at-armories.html |title=Theft of Tank Raises Questions About the Security at Armories |agency=The Associated Press |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 21, 1995 |access-date=June 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307141905/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/21/us/theft-of-tank-raises-questions-about-the-security-at-armories.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Documentary==\n''Cul de Sac: A Suburban War Story'', a documentary film, was based on the incident.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0317273|title=Cul de Sac: A Suburban War Story}}</ref>\n\nThe tank rampage also appeared in TV shows such as the ''[[World's Most Amazing Videos]]'' and ''[[Destroyed in Seconds]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe rampage was parodied in the season 11 episode of the Simpsons Brother's Little Helper <ref>=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother%27s_Little_Helper</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack]]\n*[[Marvin Heemeyer]]\n*[[The Right to Go Insane]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelson, Shawn}}\n[[Category:American criminals]]\n[[Category:American plumbers]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in California]]\n[[Category:Filmed killings by law enforcement]]\n[[Category:People from San Diego]]\n[[Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Army soldiers]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:1995 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American criminals]]\n[[Category:Vehicular rampage in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Bobbychan193", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn popular culture", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Nelson_(American_rampager)"}
