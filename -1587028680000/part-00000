His governments strengthened the welfare state in Finland, by enacting  many reforms\u2014child care laws, longer maternity leave, the annual vacation benefit act, as well as the public health act.\n\nIn domestic politics, Sorsa had a particularly difficult relationship with [[Paavo V\u00e4yrynen]], the strong-willed head of the [[Center Party (Finland)|Center Party]]. Another notable conflict was his rivalry with young rising politician [[Paavo Lipponen]].\n\nIn June 1984, Sorsa gave a speech on \"infocracy\" (i.e. the power of the [[mass media]]) at the Social Democratic party convention. Infocracy challenges [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]], is unintelligent and avoids discussing social problems, he said: it takes more interest in individual politicians than political issues and is never critical of its own actions.<ref>[https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2009/10/19/kun-sorsa-suuttui-ylelle Kun Sorsa suuttui Ylelle] ''El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto''.

In the 1970s, despite opposition from far-left parties, he championed a hard-won, free-trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which boosted ties between Finland and the countries of Western Europe.\n\nSorsa was also active in the international social democratic movement, and in the mid-1970s was elected vice-president of the [[Socialist International]].\n\nIn the late 1970s and in the 1980s the Socialist International had extensive contacts and discussion with the two leading powers of the Cold War period, the United States and the Soviet Union, on issues concerning East\u2013West relations and arms control. The Socialist International supported d\u00e9tente and disarmament agreements, such as SALT II, START and INF.

His governments strengthened the welfare state in Finland, by enacting  many reforms\u2014child care laws, longer maternity leave, the annual vacation benefit act, as well as the public health act.\n\nIn domestic politics, Sorsa had a particularly difficult relationship with [[Paavo V\u00e4yrynen]], the strong-willed head of the [[Center Party (Finland)|Center Party]]. Another notable conflict was his rivalry with young rising politician [[Paavo Lipponen]].\n\nIn June 1984, Sorsa gave a speech on \"infocracy\" (i.e. the power of the [[mass media]]) at the Social Democratic party convention. Infocracy challenges [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]], is unintelligent and avoids discussing social problems, he said: it takes more interest in individual politicians than political issues and is never critical of its own actions.<ref>[https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2009/10/19/kun-sorsa-suuttui-ylelle Kun Sorsa suuttui Ylelle] ''El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto''.

In the 1970s, despite opposition from far-left parties, he championed a hard-won, free-trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which boosted ties between Finland and the countries of Western Europe.\n\nSorsa was also active in the international social democratic movement, and in the mid-1970s was elected vice-president of the [[Socialist International]]. \n\nIn the late 1970s and in the 1980s the Socialist International had extensive contacts and discussion with the two leading powers of the Cold War period, the United States and the Soviet Union, on issues concerning East\u2013West relations and arms control. The Socialist International supported d\u00e9tente and disarmament agreements, such as SALT II, START and INF. They had several meetings and discussion in Washington, D.C., with President Jimmy Carter and Vice-President George Bush and with CPSU Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow.

{"title_page": "Scottish football league system", "text_new": "The '''Scottish football league system''' is a series of generally unconnected [[league system|leagues]] for [[Scottish football]] clubs. The Scottish system is more complicated than many other national league systems, consisting of several completely separate systems or 'grades' of leagues and clubs, with Senior football, Junior football, and beneath these Amateur and Welfare football.\n\nIn senior football in Scotland there is one national league, the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL), which has four divisions. There are also several regional leagues (most notably the [[Highland Football League]] and since 2013 the [[Lowland Football League]]). From [[2014\u201315 in Scottish football|2014\u201315]], a [[promotion and relegation|promotion/relegation]] play-off between the two regional leagues and the SPFL national league was introduced for the first time.<ref name=relegation>{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/docs/067_324__therulesofthescottishprofessionalfootballleagueasat7march2014_1396269263.pdf |title=The Rules of the SPFL |publisher=[[Scottish Professional Football League]] |format=PDF |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n[[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] are the current record holders with 54 titles. Two clubs based in England play in the senior Scottish system -  [[Berwick Rangers F.C.|Berwick Rangers]] in the [[Lowland Football League|Lowland League]] and [[Tweedmouth Rangers F.C.|Tweedmouth Rangers]] in the [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland League]]. A small number of English amateur clubs in the lowest levels of the game, based on or around the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], also compete in Scottish leagues for geographical and travel reasons.\n\n==Men's system==\n\nOverall, the structure of men's [[football in Scotland]] is among the most fractured and multi-faceted in [[Europe]], being unique in having a plurality of adult male governing bodies (with Seniors, Juniors, Amateurs and Welfarers - see below). It is not uncommon for a given town or county to have clubs in as many as three or four separate systems.\n\nUntil recently Scottish football had no pyramid [[league system]], and as a result it was impossible for clubs in regional leagues to progress into the national leagues, unless a vacancy opened in the [[Scottish Football League]].

However, it has been reported that this league will enter the pyramid at Tier 6 as the \"Northern\" feeder to the Highland League in the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe leagues below level four are classed as \"[[Non-League football|non-league football]]\", meaning they are outside the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] and are played on a regional not a national basis. The Lowland League is parallel to the Highland League. These divisions created level five on the pyramid and since season 2014\u201315, the two league winners have played off against each other, with the winner then playing the team finishing 10th in League Two in a [[promotion and relegation|promotion/relegation]] play-off. \n\nBelow the Lowland League is the [[East of Scotland Football League]] (40 clubs, which includes a reserve team, split into a 16-team Premier Division, and two First Division conferences each containing 12 teams) and the [[South of Scotland Football League]] (16 clubs in a single division) - with promotion (via a play-off) and relegation between the Lowland League.\n\nAs of [[2019\u201320 in Scottish football|2019\u201320]] this totals '''139 teams''' across ten divisions. All clubs in tier 5 and above automatically enter the [[Scottish Cup]], along with clubs in other divisions who are full members of the Scottish Football Association. Up to three non-SFA members can qualify for the Scottish Cup each season by winning the East or South leagues, or the East & South Cup-Winners Shield.

The Scottish system is more complicated than many other national league systems, consisting of several completely separate systems or 'grades' of leagues and clubs, with Senior football, Junior football, and beneath these Amateur and Welfare football.\n\nIn senior football in Scotland there is one national league, the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL), which has four divisions. There are also several regional leagues (most notably the [[Highland Football League]] and since 2013 the [[Lowland Football League]]). From [[2014\u201315 in Scottish football|2014\u201315]], a [[promotion and relegation|promotion/relegation]] play-off between the two regional leagues and the SPFL national league was introduced for the first time.<ref name=relegation>{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/docs/067_324__therulesofthescottishprofessionalfootballleagueasat7march2014_1396269263.pdf |title=The Rules of the SPFL |publisher=[[Scottish Professional Football League]] |format=PDF |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n[[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] are the current record holders with 54 titles.

A small number of English amateur clubs in the lowest levels of the game, based on or around the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], also compete in Scottish leagues for geographical and travel reasons.\n\n==Men's system==\n\nOverall, the structure of men's [[football in Scotland]] is among the most fractured and multi-faceted in [[Europe]], being unique in having a plurality of adult male governing bodies (with Seniors, Juniors, Amateurs and Welfarers - see below). It is not uncommon for a given town or county to have clubs in as many as three or four separate systems.\n\nUntil recently Scottish football had no pyramid [[league system]], and as a result it was impossible for clubs in regional leagues to progress into the national leagues, unless a vacancy opened in the [[Scottish Football League]].

It is based in the north of Scotland, including a club from the island of [[Orkney]], and currently contains 9 clubs playing 16 games. However, it has been reported that this league will enter the pyramid at Tier 6 as the \"Northern\" feeder to the Highland League in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe leagues below level four are classed as \"[[Non-League football|non-league football]]\", meaning they are outside the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] and are played on a regional not a national basis. The Lowland League is parallel to the Highland League. These divisions created level five on the pyramid and since season 2014\u201315, the two league winners have played off against each other, with the winner then playing the team finishing 10th in League Two in a [[promotion and relegation|promotion/relegation]] play-off. \n\nBelow the Lowland League is the [[East of Scotland Football League]] (40 clubs, which includes a reserve team, split into a 16-team Premier Division, and two First Division conferences each containing 12 teams) and the [[South of Scotland Football League]] (16 clubs in a single division) - with promotion (via a play-off) and relegation between the Lowland League.\n\nAs of [[2019\u201320 in Scottish football|2019\u201320]] this totals '''139 teams''' across ten divisions. All clubs in tier 5 and above automatically enter the [[Scottish Cup]], along with clubs in other divisions who are full members of the Scottish Football Association. Up to three non-SFA members can qualify for the Scottish Cup each season by winning the East or South leagues, or the East & South Cup-Winners Shield.

As of 2019\u201320 this represents a total of '''133 teams''' across 11 divisions.

Gopi is a petty thief and has stolen a very precious chain belonging to the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Queen consort|Queen]], from a [[Museum]] and is on the run. While on the run, Gopi meets Veena ([[Bhavna Pani]]). Veena is on her way to break the marriage of her lover Felix ([[Mithun Ramesh]]) to a tycoon's daughter. Due to fear of getting caught, Gopi hides the chain in Veena's bag but later discovers with the help of his \nFriend Mani ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]) that it is missing. Gopi suspects that the chain is still with Veena and so he runs away from the police and follows her in her train journey.\n\nTheir journey comes to a halt when Gopi is forced to jump off the train, because of Veena who had gone to get some water and hence misses the train. Veena realises that the place was Gopi's hometown. Subsequently he is needlessly beaten by his wicked elder brother (Baiju) and this leads to a fight. When Gopi's elder sister ([[Sona Nair]]) learns that he is in town, she comes and informs him that his younger sister's marriage is fixed. Veena's opinion of Gopi changes when she realises the reason why he became a thief.\n\nGopi calls off his younger sister's marriage when he realised that there was a catch in it. His elder brothers were greedy of the family wealth and fixed the young girl's marriage with an unmarried and uneducated but rich old man. Gopi promises that he will find a better groom for his sister and he just needs more time. However he is unable to find the precious chain from Veena's bag. Astonishingly, Veena is seen possessing the chain and asks Gopi to accompany her in her goal if he wants the chain.\n\nIn order to fulfill his promises, Gopi sets off to find some money to fund his sister's wedding and to regain all the lost family properties. At the same Mani escapes the town with his lover and all of them meet up. The four of them stay at the hotel in Mysore where Veena's lover Felix and family are staying and plans to get engaged.\n\nFelix's father, Mathew 'Mathachan' ([[Innocent (actor) |Innocent]]) has cheque bounces and needs a large amount of money to pay them off. The bride's father, Fernandez ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardhanan]]) agrees to give the money (without knowing of cases pending against Mathachan) and also arranges rooms for all the guests. At the same time Mathachan's wife plans to elope with a con man. Another guest, Hamza Koya ([[Mamukoya]]) who is separated from his wife, books a room under a false name, to acquaint with another woman. His brother in law hires a professional killer Paasha ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]) to kill Koya. Yet another guest is a retired DIG of Police, Tom Uncle ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) who is Fernandez's brother in law.\n\nGopi assigns Mani to meet a dealer's aide to sell the chain. Mani tells the man that he would be holding a rose flower as an identification. But the plans go awry as Kurupp ([[Cochin Haneefa]]) who is Mani's lover's father, arrives in search of his daughter. Mani is chased into Mathachan's room and hides in a wardrobe, while Kurupp lands in trouble after mistakingly entering Tom uncle's room and disturbing his wife. Mathachan locks the wardrobe putting his mobile phone into it. Mani informs Gopi about the mishap. Gopi after spotting Kurup who was holding the rose flower, mistakes hin into being a dealer and fixes a deal with him. There is a chaotic confusion as Kurupp's daughter's name is Maala, and Gopi refers to the chain as 'Maala' as well.\n\nPaasha gets a courier holding the photo of the man (Koya) he is assigned to kill. Felix spots Veena and reports it to his dad. Mathchan goes in search of Veena after knowing the colour of her dress. He accidentally bumps into Paasha. Unfortunately, Mathachan had a photograph of himself and Fernandez with him. Paasha who is unable to see without specs, switches Koya's photo with Fernandez's photo. At the hotel reception, a lady (Geeta Vijayan) arrives and Mathachan mistakes her to be Veena as she is also wearing the same-coloured dress. This is the same lady whom Koya is supposed to meet.\n\nPaasha while going back to his room, bumps into a rose plant and tries to arrange it properly albeit proper vision. Now, the actual dealer of the chain arrives and spots Paasha holding the flower. Both of them fix a deal and Paasha is paid money. There is an unknown confusion as Paasha was asked by his boss to snatch Koya's chain after the murder. The dealer mistakes Paasha to be talking of the one stolen by Gopi. Mani informs Gopi that he is stuck in a wardrobe and before he can specify the room, the phone charge is exhausted. Gopi request a waiter (Jagadeesh) to get Mani out somehow.\n\nMeanwhile, Paasha is now trying to kill Fernandez. Mathachan deals with the new lady who mistakes him to be Koya's man. Fernandez asks Tom Uncle to give some money to Mathachan while Mathachan asks Tom Uncle to give some of it to the lady. A Sub Inspector, Lambodaran is staying in the hotel to get hold of Mathachan albeit not knowing his identity. Mathachan's wife mistakes Koya as Uncle Tom and asks him to come to her room. Koya who obviously misinterprets her, tries to molest her thereby spreading news that Uncle Tom tried to molest Mathachan's wife. At the same time, the other lady, after mistaking Uncle Tom to be Koya, tries to seduce him and later hides in his wardrobe. The waiter finds out the lady after trying to search the wardrobe. The two incidents tarnish the image of poor Tom and he is resented by the family.\n\nAfter a wedding party, Paasha goes unconscious after falling into his own trap set for Fernandez. SI Lambodaran gets Mathachan's room number and goes there only to find Mani inside the wardrobe. Mani is chased by the SI as well as Kurupp. Mani runs into Paasha's room while Kurupp backs off after Uncle Tom spots him.\n\nFelix wants to settle his differences with Veena and goes to the con lady's room by mistake. After Mathachan reveals that Felix had a previous relationship with 'Veena' (while pointing to the other lady), Fernandez loses his impression of the family and decides to call off the marriage and also starts trusting Uncle Tom.\n\nGopi wishes to hand the chain to a dealer named Freddy and asks Veena to face him. But Freddy is caught by police and the senior officer who was behind Gopi confronts her. She doesn't give the chain back initially, but later pleads with the officer to spare the innocent Gopi's life. She also decides to give her own money entrusted by her father, to Gopi under the name of the chain.\n\nSI Lambodaran gets hold of Paasha trying to kill Fernandez, and shows him the photograph thereby making it clear that Mathachan had assigned him to kill Fernandez. There is great confusion among Paasha, Kurupp, Mathachan, Koya and the SI regarding the various deals of 'Maala'. During the chaos, Fernandez's daughter is mistaken as Kurupp's daughter and thereby kidnapped by Kurupp's men. Mani and Gopi understands the whole mayhem and flees the hotel. Mathachan's wife elopes and Koya, whose money was taken away by Mathachan's wife, follows them. The entire group of people alongwith the two families arrive at a factory space near the hotel and a hell lot of confusions cause fights and chaos.\n\nIn the end Veena gives the agreed money to Gopi. However, the police officer reveals to Gopi that the chain is still with him and that Veena had pleaded to avoid a case in Gopi's name.\n\nGopi had talked to Felix about Veena and how much she loves him. He promises Felix a large sum of money which he will pay off from the necklace's price. He does not reveal this to Veena. However Veena comes to know of Gopi's sacrifice for her despite having his own big problems. Veena calls off her wedding with Felix as she realises that he only longs for riches and does not love her at all. Gopi proposes to her and she agrees. Both set off to start a new journey of their life.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] as Gopalakrishnan (Gopi)\n*[[Bhavna Pani]] as Veena\n*[[Kalabhavan Mani]] as Mani\n*[[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as K.

Gopi is a petty thief and has stolen a very precious chain belonging to the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Queen consort|Queen]], from a [[Museum]] and is on the run. While on the run, Gopi meets Veena ([[Bhavna Pani]]). Veena is on her way to break the marriage of her lover Felix ([[Mithun Ramesh]]) to a tycoon's daughter. Due to fear of getting caught, Gopi hides the chain in Veena's bag but later discovers with the help of his \nFriend Mani ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]) that it is missing. Gopi suspects that the chain is still with Veena and so he runs away from the police and follows her in her train journey.\n\nTheir journey comes to a halt when Gopi is forced to jump off the train, because of Veena who had gone to get some water and hence misses the train. Veena realises that the place was Gopi's hometown. Subsequently he is needlessly beaten by his wicked elder brother (Baiju) and this leads to a fight. When Gopi's elder sister ([[Sona Nair]]) learns that he is in town, she comes and informs him that his younger sister's marriage is fixed. Veena's opinion of Gopi changes when she realises the reason why he became a thief.\n\nGopi calls off his younger sister's marriage when he realised that there was a catch in it. His elder brothers were greedy of the family wealth and fixed the young girl's marriage with an unmarried and uneducated but rich old man. Gopi promises that he will find a better groom for his sister and he just needs more time. However he is unable to find the precious chain from Veena's bag. Astonishingly, Veena is seen possessing the chain and asks Gopi to accompany her in her goal if he wants the chain.\n\nIn order to fulfill his promises, Gopi sets off to find some money to fund his sister's wedding and to regain all the lost family properties. At the same Mani escapes the town with his lover and all of them meet up. The four of them stay at the hotel in Mysore where Veena's lover Felix and family are staying and plans to get engaged.\n\nFelix's father, Mathew 'Mathachan' ([[Innocent (actor) |Innocent]]) has cheque bounces and needs a large amount of money to pay them off. The bride's father, Fernandez ([[Janardhanan]]) agrees to give the money (without knowing of cases pending against Mathachan) and also arranges rooms for all the guests. At the same time Mathachan's wife plans to elope with a con man. Another guest, Hamza Koya ([[Mamukoya]]) who is separated from his wife, books a room under a false name, to acquaint with another woman. His brother in law hires a professional killer Paasha ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]) to kill Koya. Yet another guest is a retired DIG of Police, Tom Uncle ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) who is Fernandez's brother in law.\n\nGopi assigns Mani to meet a dealer's aide to sell the chain. Mani tells the man that he would be holding a rose flower as an identification. But the plans go awry as Kurupp ([[Cochin Haneefa]]) who is Mani's lover's father, arrives in search of his daughter. Mani is chased into Mathachan's room and hides in a wardrobe, while Kurupp lands in trouble after mistakingly entering Tom uncle's room and disturbing his wife. Mathachan locks the wardrobe putting his mobile phone into it. Mani informs Gopi about the mishap.

At the time, Wheeling was developing into a productive factory town, the concentration of which was iron and steel mills. The environment of Rebecca's home town would later affect the themes and vision of her fiction, like ''Life in the Iron Mills''.  Despite Wheeling's productivity and its accessible location along the [[Ohio River]], Davis described her childhood as having belonged to a slower, simpler time, writing in her 1904 autobiography ''Bits of Gossip'' that, \"there were no railways in it, no automobiles or trolleys, no telegraphs, no sky-scraping houses.

She greatly admired both of these [[American literature|American writer]]s. During this trip around the North, which originated with her publisher's desire to meet her personally, Davis also became close friends with her publisher's wife, [[Annie Adams Fields]].<ref name=\"Tillie\" />\n\nOn her journey back from a meeting with her publisher, Rebecca met L. Clarke Davis in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], whom she had been corresponding with since he had contacted her as an admirer of her work after the publication of ''Life in the Iron Mills''. They became engaged one week after meeting and were married on March 5, 1863. Clarke was four years younger than Davis and not yet financially or professionally established in the world. The following year she gave birth to their first son, [[Richard Harding Davis]], who was to become a writer and journalist himself. Their second son, [[Charles Belmont Davis]] was born in 1866 and also became a writer; their daughter, Nora, in 1872.<ref name=\"Tillie\" />\n\nAt the start of their marriage, Rebecca was the primary income provider for the family, as Clarke worked to establish himself in his law career. She accomplished this through her writing and as an editor for the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. However, ten years after their marriage Davis had faded substantially from the literary world. Clarke gave up law and became an editor for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' as well. In 1892, Davis received a small critical and popular success with ''Silhouettes of American Life'', but it was her last. She died at age 79, on September 29, 1910.<ref name=\"Tillie\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nA prolific writer, Rebecca Harding Davis is credited with over 500 published works. Despite her outpouring of literary works, she was almost entirely forgotten by the time of her death in 1910. However, Davis was rediscovered in the very early 1970s by the feminist writer [[Tillie Olsen]], who found a collection of Davis's works in a junk shop. Olsen quickly recognized the talent and significance of Davis's writings, and personally endeavored to reintroduce Davis's work. In 1972, [[The Feminist Press]] published ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]'' with Olsen's own biographical interpretation of Davis's life in relation to a selection of her published works.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hadley|first=Gregory|title=Rebecca Harding Davis: An Introduction to Her Life, Faith, and Literature|url=http://www.nuis.ac.jp/~hadley/publication/rhd/RHD.htm |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref> Olsen's non-fiction volume, titled ''Silences'', was an analysis of authors' silent periods in literature, including writer's blocks, unpublished work, and the problems that working-class writers, and women in particular, have in finding the time to concentrate on their art, and the second part of the book was a study of the work of Davis.\n\nIn April 2013, a [[historical marker]] in Davis's honor was placed near [[Swanson Science Center]], the site of the former [[McIlvaine Hall]]/[[Washington Female Seminary]].<ref name=phmcdatabase>{{cite web | title =  Rebecca Harding Davis (1831\u20131910) - PHMC Historical Markers | work =Historical Marker Database | publisher = Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission | url =http://search.pahistoricalmarkers.com/ | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}</ref>  The effort to place the marker there was led by Jennifer Harding, a [[Washington & Jefferson College]] English professor, who has no biological relationship to the author.<ref name=mansfield>{{cite news | last =Mansfield | first =Katherine | title =Descendant secures state marker for Rebecca Harding Davis | newspaper =[[Observer-Reporter]] | date =June 30, 2013 | url =http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20120630/LOC05/120639999 | accessdate =May 30, 2013 | archivedate =May 31, 2013 | archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/6H151TQSf?url=http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20120630/LOC05/120639999 | url-status =dead }}</ref> The historical marker was the first dedicated to a woman in Washington, Pennsylvania.<ref>http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20130413/NEWS01/130419666/-1/NEWS10</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an issue of ''[[Topic- The Washington & Jefferson College Review]]'' was dedicated to articles about Davis.<ref>{{cite web | title =Articles Published in TOPIC - #59: Rebecca Harding Davis | publisher =[[Topic- The Washington & Jefferson College Review]] | date = | url =http://www2.washjeff.edu/topic/issues.htm | accessdate = May 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA thorough biography titled Rebecca Harding Davis: A Life Among Writers by Sharon M.

The novella saw its publication around the dawn of the American Civil War, and is one of Davis's earliest published works. It has become an important text not only for its artistic merit, but for its historical implications. Both its form and content were ground breaking at the time of its publication, being a narrative that follows the lives of laborers and the consequences of industrialization, in a traditionally realistic style.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n\n''Life in the Iron Mills'' is set in a small village whose center is industrial work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly \u201cmasses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes\u201d.<ref name=\"Project Gutenburg\">{{cite web |first= R.H. |last=Davis|title=Life in the Iron-Mills; or, the Korl Woman |publisher=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/876|accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref> The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure and fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe\u2019s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his yearning for a better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rose |first=Jane|series=American History through Literature 1820\u20131870 (Volume 2)|year=2006 |title=Life in the Iron Mills |publisher= Novelguide.com|url= http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/ahlt_0001_0002_0/ahlt_0001_0002_0_00143.html |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough the novella is concerned with larger themes such as industrialization and the working class, Davis's depiction of Hugh Wolfe, and her command of realism allows the reader to focus on the individual within the labor class, and the consequences of its realities upon his heart and soul. In ''Life in the Iron Mills'', \"Harding reveals what, historically was done to workers and suggests what could be done for them, moral education and social uplift.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=\"These mill-hands are gettin' onbearable\": The Logic of Class Formation in ''Life in the Iron Mills'' |journal=Women's Studies Quarterly |volume=26 |issue= 1/2 Working\u2013Class Lives and Cultures |last=Watson |first=William L.  |year=1998 |publisher=The Feminist Press |location=City University of New York |pages=116\u2013136 |jstor=40003465}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\nRebecca Harding Davis's literary style is most commonly labeled as [[literary realism|realism]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Milner Lasseter|first=Janice|publisher=Society for the Study of American Woman Writers|title=Rebecca Harding Davis: A Biographical Sketch & Bibliography|url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~dek7/SSAWW/writDavisBio.htm |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref> However, her literary works mark a transition from [[romanticism]] to literary realism, so they combine elements of Sentimentalism, Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism. For instance, \"Life on the Iron Mills\" uses sentimental elements such as a narrator who directly addresses the well defined reader, a didactic purpose, and characters in extreme situations for the purpose of emotionally stirring the reader to action.  The novella also uses Romantic elements such as a statue symbolizing a spiritually hungry woman and owned by the narrator, reminiscent of the relic found in the custom house by the narrator of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ''The Scarlet Letter''.  And it uses a realistic style with journalistic specificity and characters typical of their social class and speaking in its vernacular, comparable to that of writers in the height of American literary realism, which came two decades after the text was published.<ref name=\"Larson\"/> Although realism is the genre most prominently attached to Davis's collective works, [[Literary naturalism|naturalism]] is also prevalent in her writing style. Naturalism is thematically linked to realism. Where realists, like Davis, endeavor to depict reality, naturalists expand on that reality by approaching the scientific and or psychological influences on characters due to their environments. In ''Life in the Iron Mills'', the two genres are blended to create a realistic depiction of the everyday life of iron mill worker Hugh Wolfe, as well as illustrate the effects of that environment upon him. \nIn addition to realism and naturalism, Davis also published works employing such literary genres as the [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] and [[folklore]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Sharon M. |publisher = The Society for the Study of Rebecca Harding Davis and Her World |url=http://scotus.francis.edu/rebeccahardingdavis/ |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |title=Rebecca Harding Davis}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nRecurring themes in Rebecca Harding Davis's works are the social and political issues of the nineteenth-century: the [[American Civil War]], race, regionalism, the working class, and women.<ref name=\"Cadwaller\">{{cite web|last=Cadwallader |first= Robin |url=http://scotus.francis.edu/rebeccahardingdavis/About.htm |title=About Rebecca Harding Davis|publisher=The Society for the Study of Rebecca Harding Davis and Her World |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Industrialism===\nHaving lived in the steel town of Wheeling, West Virginia, Davis had first-hand experience with the controversies and hardships associated with industrialism. She utilizes the theme of industrialism in ''Life in the Iron Mills'' by calling attention to the dark and dismal setting of the iron mills. She not only provides vivid imagery of the dismal landscape, but imagery of the working class as well. By exploring the effects of the iron mills on its inhabitants, Davis is able to depict her own concerns and frustrations associated with the marginalization of the working class.<ref>\"Davis, Rebecca Harding, 1831\u20131910.\" [http://0-gateway.proquest.com.opac.sfsu.edu/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&xri:pqil:res_ver=0.2&res_id=xri:lion-us&rft_id=xri:lion:ft:ref:BIO003375:0 Literature Online]. Cambridge: Chadwyck-Healey, 2005. Web.</ref> Davis's depiction of the daily routines of the laboring class is a common theme throughout her writing, and most importantly serves the purpose of unveiling the maltreatment of such individuals. Her goal in relating the physical and mental starvation that plagues the inhabitants of these mills is to urge her audience to form spiritual solutions to these issues rather than social solutions.<ref name=\"Yellin\">{{cite journal |title=The 'Feminization' of Rebecca Harding Davis. |last=Yellin |first=Jean Fagan |date=July 1990 |journal=American Literary History |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=203\u201319 |jstor=490026 |doi=10.1093/alh/2.2.203}}</ref>\n\n===Female social roles===\nThe exploration of female social roles in nineteenth-century society is a common theme in Davis's works. Her female characters can be viewed as early proto-feminist symbols because they exemplify the issues surrounding the commodification of women, and the patriarchal society that places restrictions on female identity. These issues can be seen in the heroine of Davis's novel ''Margret Howth''. Though Howth works in the mills, her issues flow from her relations with her male counterparts. At novel's end she marries Stephen Holmes, which can both symbolize her acceptance of her Christian destiny despite her father's protestations, and her acceptance of the role of wife and mother.<ref name=\"Yellin\"/> Through this character Davis is representing the power that patriarchal society has over the nineteenth-century female, while also presenting a strong female character who recognizes her moral independence. Davis goes further in her exploration of the true female identity by addressing the role domesticity plays in the lives of her characters. Domesticity, which once defined the roles of nineteenth-century women, is altered by Davis's placement of women in the iron mills.<ref name= \"The Colombia History\">{{cite book |title=The Colombia History of the American Novel |last=Elliot |first=Emory |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Columbia UP |location=New York |isbn= 9780231073608|pages= 173\u201378|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Columbia_history_of_the_American_nov.html?id=2IA7o-OTyEsC |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref> By describing the harsh conditions under which these women labored, Davis is capitalizing on the idea that women are capable of integrating work life into their home life.\n\nAnother work in which Davis depicts the power of a female figure is ''Life in the Iron Mills''.<ref name=\"Yellin\"/> The Korl Woman, sculpted by Hugh Wolfe, represents an all-encompassing sublime image of laboring class womanhood. The intensity with which this figure is received, and the humanistic quality of its structure relay a message intended to reveal the true image of not only laborers, but female beauty as well. The Korl woman serves as a symbol that challenges nineteenth-century standards of femininity. Thus, Davis utilizes the Korl Woman to depict the realistic effects of the iron mills, while simultaneously questioning female societal restrictions as a whole.<ref name= \"The Colombia History\" />\n\n== Selected works ==\n[[File:Silhouettes Davis.jpg|thumb|right|100px|First edition cover of ''Silhouettes of American Life'', 1892.]] \n[[File:Warrick.jpg|thumb|right|100px|First edition cover of ''Doctor Warrick's Daughters'', 1896.]] \n'''Books''' \n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Margret Howth'' (1861)\n* ''Waiting for the Verdict'' (1867)\n* ''Kitty's Choice or Berrytown and Other Stories'' (1873)\n* ''John Andross'' (1874)\n* ''A Law unto Herself'' (1878)\n* ''Natasqua'' (1886)\n* ''Kent Hampden'' (1892)\n* ''Silhouettes of American Life'' (1892)\n* ''Doctor Warrick's Daughters'' (1896)\n* ''Frances Waldeaux'' (1897)\n* ''Bits of Gossip'' (1904)\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Short fiction''' \n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]'', ''The Atlantic Monthly'' (1861)\n* ''David Gaunt'' (1862)\n* ''John Lamar'' (1862)\n* ''Paul Blecker'' (1863)\n* ''[[wikisource:The Wife's Story|The Wife's Story]]'' (1864), ''The Atlantic Monthly'' (July 1864)\n* ''Ellen'' (1865)\n* ''The Harmonists'' (1866)\n* ''In the Market'' (1868)\n* ''A Pearl of Great Price'' (1868)\n* ''Put out of the Way'' (1870)\n* ''General William Wirt Colby'',  ''Wood's Household Magazine'' (1873)\n* ''Earthen Pitchers'' (1873\u20131874)\n* ''Marcia'' (1876)\n* ''A Day with Doctor Sarah'' (1878)\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Essays'''\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Men's Rights'' (1869)\n* ''Some Testimony in the Case'' (1885)\n* ''Here and There in the South'' (1887)\n* ''Women in Literature'' (1891)\n* ''In the Gray Cabins of New England'' (1895)\n* ''The Disease of Money-Getting'' (1902)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Harris, Sharon M.

They were impressed with the author's goal, which was \"to dig into the commonplace, this vulgar American life, and see what is in it\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kort|first=Carol|title=A Biographical Dictionary A to Z of American Women Writers|year=2000|publisher=Facts on File, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-3727-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tozofamericanwom00kort/page/47 47]|url=https://archive.org/details/tozofamericanwom00kort/page/47}}</ref> She later met and became acquainted with Emerson whilst staying with [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] during a trip she had long delayed to meet her publisher [[James Thomas Fields]]. She greatly admired both of these [[American literature|American writer]]s. During this trip around the North, which originated with her publisher's desire to meet her personally, Davis also became close friends with her publisher's wife, [[Annie Adams Fields]].<ref name=\"Tillie\" />\n\nOn her journey back from a meeting with her publisher, Rebecca met L. Clarke Davis in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], whom she had been corresponding with since he had contacted her as an admirer of her work after the publication of ''Life in the Iron Mills''. They became engaged one week after meeting and were married on March 5, 1863. Clarke was four years younger than Davis and not yet financially or professionally established in the world. The following year she gave birth to their first son, [[Richard Harding Davis]], who was to become a writer and journalist himself. Their second son, [[Charles Belmont Davis was born in 1866 and also became a writer; their daughter, Nora, in 1872.<ref name=\"Tillie\" />\n\nAt the start of their marriage, Rebecca was the primary income provider for the family, as Clarke worked to establish himself in his law career. She accomplished this through her writing and as an editor for the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. However, ten years after their marriage Davis had faded substantially from the literary world. Clarke gave up law and became an editor for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' as well. In 1892, Davis received a small critical and popular success with ''Silhouettes of American Life'', but it was her last. She died at age 79, on September 29, 1910.<ref name=\"Tillie\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nA prolific writer, Rebecca Harding Davis is credited with over 500 published works. Despite her outpouring of literary works, she was almost entirely forgotten by the time of her death in 1910. However, Davis was rediscovered in the very early 1970s by the feminist writer [[Tillie Olsen]], who found a collection of Davis's works in a junk shop. Olsen quickly recognized the talent and significance of Davis's writings, and personally endeavored to reintroduce Davis's work. In 1972, [[The Feminist Press]] published ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]'' with Olsen's own biographical interpretation of Davis's life in relation to a selection of her published works.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hadley|first=Gregory|title=Rebecca Harding Davis: An Introduction to Her Life, Faith, and Literature|url=http://www.nuis.ac.jp/~hadley/publication/rhd/RHD.htm |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref> Olsen's non-fiction volume, titled ''Silences'', was an analysis of authors' silent periods in literature, including writer's blocks, unpublished work, and the problems that working-class writers, and women in particular, have in finding the time to concentrate on their art, and the second part of the book was a study of the work of Davis.\n\nIn April 2013, a [[historical marker]] in Davis's honor was placed near [[Swanson Science Center]], the site of the former [[McIlvaine Hall]]/[[Washington Female Seminary]].<ref name=phmcdatabase>{{cite web | title =  Rebecca Harding Davis (1831\u20131910) - PHMC Historical Markers | work =Historical Marker Database | publisher = Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission | url =http://search.pahistoricalmarkers.com/ | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}</ref>  The effort to place the marker there was led by Jennifer Harding, a [[Washington & Jefferson College]] English professor, who has no biological relationship to the author.<ref name=mansfield>{{cite news | last =Mansfield | first =Katherine | title =Descendant secures state marker for Rebecca Harding Davis | newspaper =[[Observer-Reporter]] | date =June 30, 2013 | url =http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20120630/LOC05/120639999 | accessdate =May 30, 2013 | archivedate =May 31, 2013 | archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/6H151TQSf?url=http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20120630/LOC05/120639999 | url-status =dead }}</ref> The historical marker was the first dedicated to a woman in Washington, Pennsylvania.<ref>http://www.observer-reporter.com/article/20130413/NEWS01/130419666/-1/NEWS10</ref>\n\nIn 2013, an issue of ''[[Topic- The Washington & Jefferson College Review]]'' was dedicated to articles about Davis.<ref>{{cite web | title =Articles Published in TOPIC - #59: Rebecca Harding Davis | publisher =[[Topic- The Washington & Jefferson College Review]] | date = | url =http://www2.washjeff.edu/topic/issues.htm | accessdate = May 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA thorough biography titled Rebecca Harding Davis: A Life Among Writers by Sharon M.

The novella saw its publication around the dawn of the American Civil War, and is one of Davis's earliest published works. It has become an important text not only for its artistic merit, but for its historical implications. Both its form and content were ground breaking at the time of its publication, being a narrative that follows the lives of laborers and the consequences of industrialization, in a traditionally realistic style.<ref name=\"Larson\"/>\n\n''Life in the Iron Mills'' is set in a small village whose center is industrial work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly \u201cmasses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes\u201d.<ref name=\"Project Gutenburg\">{{cite web |first= R.H. |last=Davis|title=Life in the Iron-Mills; or, the Korl Woman |publisher=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/876|accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref> The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure and fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe\u2019s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his yearning for a better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rose |first=Jane|series=American History through Literature 1820\u20131870 (Volume 2)|year=2006 |title=Life in the Iron Mills |publisher= Novelguide.com|url= http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/ahlt_0001_0002_0/ahlt_0001_0002_0_00143.html |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough the novella is concerned with larger themes such as industrialization and the working class, Davis's depiction of Hugh Wolfe, and her command of realism allows the reader to focus on the individual within the labor class, and the consequences of its realities upon his heart and soul. In ''Life in the Iron Mills'', \"Harding reveals what, historically was done to workers and suggests what could be done for them, moral education and social uplift.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=\"These mill-hands are gettin' onbearable\": The Logic of Class Formation in ''Life in the Iron Mills'' |journal=Women's Studies Quarterly |volume=26 |issue= 1/2 Working\u2013Class Lives and Cultures |last=Watson |first=William L.  |year=1998 |publisher=The Feminist Press |location=City University of New York |pages=116\u2013136 |jstor=40003465}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\nRebecca Harding Davis's literary style is most commonly labeled as [[literary realism|realism]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Milner Lasseter|first=Janice|publisher=Society for the Study of American Woman Writers|title=Rebecca Harding Davis: A Biographical Sketch & Bibliography|url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~dek7/SSAWW/writDavisBio.htm |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref> However, her literary works mark a transition from [[romanticism]] to literary realism, so they combine elements of Sentimentalism, Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism. For instance, \"Life on the Iron Mills\" uses sentimental elements such as a narrator who directly addresses the well defined reader, a didactic purpose, and characters in extreme situations for the purpose of emotionally stirring the reader to action.  The novella also uses Romantic elements such as a statue symbolizing a spiritually hungry woman and owned by the narrator, reminiscent of the relic found in the custom house by the narrator of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ''The Scarlet Letter''.  And it uses a realistic style with journalistic specificity and characters typical of their social class and speaking in its vernacular, comparable to that of writers in the height of American literary realism, which came two decades after the text was published.<ref name=\"Larson\"/> Although realism is the genre most prominently attached to Davis's collective works, [[Literary naturalism|naturalism]] is also prevalent in her writing style. Naturalism is thematically linked to realism. Where realists, like Davis, endeavor to depict reality, naturalists expand on that reality by approaching the scientific and or psychological influences on characters due to their environments. In ''Life in the Iron Mills'', the two genres are blended to create a realistic depiction of the everyday life of iron mill worker Hugh Wolfe, as well as illustrate the effects of that environment upon him. \nIn addition to realism and naturalism, Davis also published works employing such literary genres as the [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] and [[folklore]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Sharon M. |publisher = The Society for the Study of Rebecca Harding Davis and Her World |url=http://scotus.francis.edu/rebeccahardingdavis/ |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |title=Rebecca Harding Davis}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nRecurring themes in Rebecca Harding Davis's works are the social and political issues of the nineteenth-century: the [[American Civil War]], race, regionalism, the working class, and women.<ref name=\"Cadwaller\">{{cite web|last=Cadwallader |first= Robin |url=http://scotus.francis.edu/rebeccahardingdavis/About.htm |title=About Rebecca Harding Davis|publisher=The Society for the Study of Rebecca Harding Davis and Her World |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Industrialism===\nHaving lived in the steel town of Wheeling, West Virginia, Davis had first-hand experience with the controversies and hardships associated with industrialism. She utilizes the theme of industrialism in ''Life in the Iron Mills'' by calling attention to the dark and dismal setting of the iron mills. She not only provides vivid imagery of the dismal landscape, but imagery of the working class as well. By exploring the effects of the iron mills on its inhabitants, Davis is able to depict her own concerns and frustrations associated with the marginalization of the working class.<ref>\"Davis, Rebecca Harding, 1831\u20131910.\" [http://0-gateway.proquest.com.opac.sfsu.edu/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&xri:pqil:res_ver=0.2&res_id=xri:lion-us&rft_id=xri:lion:ft:ref:BIO003375:0 Literature Online]. Cambridge: Chadwyck-Healey, 2005. Web.</ref> Davis's depiction of the daily routines of the laboring class is a common theme throughout her writing, and most importantly serves the purpose of unveiling the maltreatment of such individuals. Her goal in relating the physical and mental starvation that plagues the inhabitants of these mills is to urge her audience to form spiritual solutions to these issues rather than social solutions.<ref name=\"Yellin\">{{cite journal |title=The 'Feminization' of Rebecca Harding Davis. |last=Yellin |first=Jean Fagan |date=July 1990 |journal=American Literary History |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=203\u201319 |jstor=490026 |doi=10.1093/alh/2.2.203}}</ref>\n\n===Female social roles===\nThe exploration of female social roles in nineteenth-century society is a common theme in Davis's works. Her female characters can be viewed as early proto-feminist symbols because they exemplify the issues surrounding the commodification of women, and the patriarchal society that places restrictions on female identity. These issues can be seen in the heroine of Davis's novel ''Margret Howth''. Though Howth works in the mills, her issues flow from her relations with her male counterparts. At novel's end she marries Stephen Holmes, which can both symbolize her acceptance of her Christian destiny despite her father's protestations, and her acceptance of the role of wife and mother.<ref name=\"Yellin\"/> Through this character Davis is representing the power that patriarchal society has over the nineteenth-century female, while also presenting a strong female character who recognizes her moral independence. Davis goes further in her exploration of the true female identity by addressing the role domesticity plays in the lives of her characters. Domesticity, which once defined the roles of nineteenth-century women, is altered by Davis's placement of women in the iron mills.<ref name= \"The Colombia History\">{{cite book |title=The Colombia History of the American Novel |last=Elliot |first=Emory |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Columbia UP |location=New York |isbn= 9780231073608|pages= 173\u201378|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Columbia_history_of_the_American_nov.html?id=2IA7o-OTyEsC |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref> By describing the harsh conditions under which these women labored, Davis is capitalizing on the idea that women are capable of integrating work life into their home life.\n\nAnother work in which Davis depicts the power of a female figure is ''Life in the Iron Mills''.<ref name=\"Yellin\"/> The Korl Woman, sculpted by Hugh Wolfe, represents an all-encompassing sublime image of laboring class womanhood. The intensity with which this figure is received, and the humanistic quality of its structure relay a message intended to reveal the true image of not only laborers, but female beauty as well. The Korl woman serves as a symbol that challenges nineteenth-century standards of femininity. Thus, Davis utilizes the Korl Woman to depict the realistic effects of the iron mills, while simultaneously questioning female societal restrictions as a whole.<ref name= \"The Colombia History\" />\n\n== Selected works ==\n[[File:Silhouettes Davis.jpg|thumb|right|100px|First edition cover of ''Silhouettes of American Life'', 1892.]] \n[[File:Warrick.jpg|thumb|right|100px|First edition cover of ''Doctor Warrick's Daughters'', 1896.]] \n'''Books''' \n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Margret Howth'' (1861)\n* ''Waiting for the Verdict'' (1867)\n* ''Kitty's Choice or Berrytown and Other Stories'' (1873)\n* ''John Andross'' (1874)\n* ''A Law unto Herself'' (1878)\n* ''Natasqua'' (1886)\n* ''Kent Hampden'' (1892)\n* ''Silhouettes of American Life'' (1892)\n* ''Doctor Warrick's Daughters'' (1896)\n* ''Frances Waldeaux'' (1897)\n* ''Bits of Gossip'' (1904)\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Short fiction''' \n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]'', ''The Atlantic Monthly'' (1861)\n* ''David Gaunt'' (1862)\n* ''John Lamar'' (1862)\n* ''Paul Blecker'' (1863)\n* ''[[wikisource:The Wife's Story|The Wife's Story]]'' (1864), ''The Atlantic Monthly'' (July 1864)\n* ''Ellen'' (1865)\n* ''The Harmonists'' (1866)\n* ''In the Market'' (1868)\n* ''A Pearl of Great Price'' (1868)\n* ''Put out of the Way'' (1870)\n* ''General William Wirt Colby'',  ''Wood's Household Magazine'' (1873)\n* ''Earthen Pitchers'' (1873\u20131874)\n* ''Marcia'' (1876)\n* ''A Day with Doctor Sarah'' (1878)\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Essays'''\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Men's Rights'' (1869)\n* ''Some Testimony in the Case'' (1885)\n* ''Here and There in the South'' (1887)\n* ''Women in Literature'' (1891)\n* ''In the Gray Cabins of New England'' (1895)\n* ''The Disease of Money-Getting'' (1902)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Harris, Sharon M.

The film was also Myers and Timberlake's second collaboration after ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007). The film was a financial flop and was universally panned by critics.\n\nThe Guru Pitka ([[Mike Myers]]) is tasked with revitalizing the hockey team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team has been plagued with loses and their star player suffers a marital tragedy that throws him off his game. In order for Guru Pitka to become the next [[Deepak Chopra]], he must help the team actualize their potential to win the [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{essay-like|date=June 2017}}\n\nGuru Pitka is the self proclaimed \"number-two Guru in the world\", after [[Deepak Chopra]]. A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others.\n\nPitka's dream is to become the number-one Guru and appear on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Mariska Hargitay]]. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint slide]] shows.\n\nIn Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for [[Los Angeles Kings]] goaltender Jacques \"L\u00e8 Cocq\" Grand\u00e9. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him $2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the [[Stanley Cup]]. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] will have him on her show.\n\nPitka and Jane bond on the plane ride. Jane became a fan of Pitka\u2019s work due to the death of her father (in real life, Mike Myers became a fan of Deepak Chopra after his father\u2019s death). Jane admits she has a crush on him and Pitka asks if she has a husband or a boyfriend which she says no to. Pitka is surprised she is single. Jane reveals the \"Bullard Curse.\" Canadian hockey fans dislike her very much and throw food at her when they see her.\n\nPitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck.\n\nLater, Pitka has dinner with Jane. Pitka tries to kiss Jane, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkov berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground.\n\nDick Pants warns Pitka to hurry up the process or he will lose his spot on Oprah again to Deepak Chopra. Pitka is adamant that Darren is not ready.  Pitka and Darren attempt a confrontation, but her invective ends up scaring both of them away. Pitka helps Darren realise that since his mother only showed him love when he succeeded he had grown to believe Prudence would only love him as long as he won. Pitka then drives himself and Darren to Niagara Falls for a \"Heart to Heart\".\n\nWith time running out, Pitka distracts Le Cocq with his idol, [[Celine Dion]], then tells Prudence that Darren stood up to his mom, encouraging her to return to her husband. During the lead up to the final game, Le Cocq, having heard that Darren cannot play with his mother in the audience, gets her to sing the national anthem, causing Darren to flee. At the airport on his way to guest on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|''Oprah'']], Pitka sees the news on television and defies his agent by going back to help Darren.\n\nAfter smoothing things over with his mother, Darren recovers until Le Cocq brags that Prudence prefers him in bed. Darren freezes and Pitka realizes he needs another distraction, which he provides by getting two elephants to have sex in the middle of the rink, in front of the live television audience. Darren wakes up from his stupor and scores the winning goal. After the game, Pitka makes up with Jane and Coach Cherkov, then meets Deepak Chopra and decides that he is fine with being the first Guru Pitka instead of the next Deepak Chopra.\n\nBack in India, Guru Tugginmypudha tells Pitka that he has finally learned to love himself and removes Pitka's chastity belt, revealing there was a hook in the back. The film ends with Jane and Pitka dancing together in a [[Bollywood]]-style number to a rendition of \"[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Guru Maurice Pitka / Himself\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Jane Bullard\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grand\u00e9\n* [[Romany Malco]] as Darren Roanoke\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Prudence Roanoke, Darren's wife and Jacques' lover\n* [[Verne Troyer]] as Coach Punch Cherkov\n* [[Omid Djalili]] as Guru Satchabigknoba / Gagandeep Singh\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Guru Tugginmypudha\n* [[Telma Hopkins]] as Lillian Roanoke\n* [[Manu Narayan]] as Rajneesh, Pitka's assistant\n* [[John Oliver]] as Richard \"Dick\" Pants\n* [[Stephen Colbert]] as Jay Kell\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] as Trent Lueders\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Bar Patron\n* [[Daniel Tosh]] as Cowboy Hat\n* [[Samantha Bee]] as [[Cinnabun]] cashier\n\n;As themselves\n* [[Mariska Hargitay]]\n* [[Jessica Simpson]]\n* [[Kanye West]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] (''uncredited'')\n* [[Rob Blake]]\n* [[Deepak Chopra]]\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] (voice)\n\n==Music==\nThe original score for the film was composed by [[George S.

Darren freezes and Pitka realizes he needs another distraction, which he provides by getting two elephants to have sex in the middle of the rink, in front of the live television audience. Darren wakes up from his stupor and scores the winning goal. After the game, Pitka makes up with Jane and Coach Cherkov, then meets Deepak Chopra and decides that he is fine with being the first Guru Pitka instead of the next Deepak Chopra.\n\nBack in India, Guru Tugginmypudha tells Pitka that he has finally learned to love himself and removes Pitka's chastity belt, revealing there was a hook in the back. The film ends with Jane and Pitka dancing together in a [[Bollywood]]-style number to a rendition of \"[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Guru Maurice Pitka / Himself\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Jane Bullard\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grand\u00e9\n* [[Romany Malco]] as Darren Roanoke\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Prudence Roanoke, Darren's wife and Jacques' lover\n* [[Verne Troyer]] as Coach Punch Cherkov\n* [[Omid Djalili]] as Guru Satchabigknoba / Gagandeep Singh\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Guru Tugginmypudha\n* [[Telma Hopkins]] as Lillian Roanoke\n* [[Manu Narayan]] as Rajneesh, Pitka's assistant\n* [[John Oliver]] as Richard \"Dick\" Pants\n* [[Stephen Colbert]] as Jay Kell\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] as Trent Lueders\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Bar Patron\n* [[Daniel Tosh]] as Cowboy Hat\n* [[Samantha Bee]] as [[Cinnabun]] cashier\n\n;As themselves\n* [[Mariska Hargitay]]\n* [[Jessica Simpson]]\n* [[Kanye West]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] (''uncredited'')\n* [[Rob Blake]]\n* [[Deepak Chopra]]\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] (voice)\n\n==Music==\nThe original score for the film was composed by [[George S.

Meeting [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] at his doctor's office, he asks for more help for his medical and legal expenses, but Tony has his own expenses and angrily tells Junior to manage his affairs better. Junior later promotes [[Bobby Baccalieri]]. [[New Jersey General Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Ronald Zellman|Ron Zellman]] tells Tony about a special Newark Development District where Junior has a property which is going to rise in value; Tony buys it, pretending that he is doing his uncle a favour. He also calls a meeting with the family's ''[[caporegime|capos]]'' in which he harangues them about the zero growth in business.\n\n[[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] is worried about money, having seen the widowed [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Angie Bonpensiero|Angie Bonpensiero]] working at a supermarket. Tony insists that, if anything happens to him, she and the children will be provided for, but will not give details. He also says money is no longer hidden in the house, but later retrieves packets of banknotes from a shed and from his car and hides them in a tub of duck feed; Carmela happens to pass by just after he closes the tub.\n\n[[Paulie Walnuts]] has been arrested in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]] on a gun charge, and resents Tony's apparent indifference. From a jailhouse payphone, he calls [[Johnny Sack]], who is cultivating his dissatisfaction.\n\n[[Ralphie Cifaretto]] and [[Janice Soprano]] are growing closer. At a Sunday dinner at Tony and Carmela's home, Janice follows Ralphie to the bathroom and joins him for [[cocaine]] and sex\u2014even though Ralphie came with Rosalie Aprile, who he is still formally dating. \n\n[[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] believes that Tony is treating him harshly because he questioned his action against [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.]]. He is injecting heroin every day. [[Adriana La Cerva|Adriana]] is now close friends with Danielle, who is actually FBI Agent [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup|Deborah Ciccerone]]. Chris complains that she is always in their home. Adriana takes her to Tony's home and introduces her to him. Junior hears that there was an FBI agent in his doctor's office. He realizes it must have been the nurse he was flirting with, and is mortified that he failed to suspect her.\n\nSpeaking to [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] about business with unusual frankness, Tony says that usually, \"There's two endings for a guy like me. . . Dead or in the can.\"  But there is a third option, to rely \"on blood relations\": he will use his nephew Chris as a buffer between others and himself. As part of what he calls the bonding process, he gives Chris the name and home address of the man, a just-retired policeman, who, Tony says, killed Chris's father. Chris goes to his home and kills him.\n\n==First appearances==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Robert \"Bobby\" Baccalieri III|Bobby Baccalieri, III]]''': Bobby's son\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Karen Baccalieri|Karen Baccalieri]]''': Bobby's wife\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Sophia Baccalieri|Sophia Baccalieri]]''': Bobby's daughter\n*'''[[Carlo Gervasi]]''': Soprano/DiMeo crime family capo\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Murf Lupo|Murf Lupo]]''': Aging former Soprano/DiMeo crime family capo and friend of Junior Soprano\n*'''Cosette''': the dog of Adriana La Cerva\n\n==Deceased==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Detective Barry Haydu|Det.

Meeting [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] at his doctor's office, he asks for more help for his medical and legal expenses, but Tony has his own expenses and angrily tells Junior to manage his affairs better. Junior later promotes [[Bobby Baccalieri]]. [[New Jersey General Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Ronald Zellman|Ron Zellman]] tells Tony about a special Newark Development District where Junior has a property which is going to rise in value; Tony buys it, pretending that he is doing his uncle a favour. He also calls a meeting with the family's ''[[caporegime|capos]]'' in which he harangues them about the zero growth in business.\n\n[[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] is worried about money, having seen the widowed [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Angie Bonpensiero|Angie Bonpensiero]] working at a supermarket. Tony insists that, if anything happens to him, she and the children will be provided for, but will not give details. He also says money is no longer hidden in the house, but later retrieves packets of banknotes from a shed and from his car and hides them in a tub of duck feed; Carmela happens to pass by just after he closes the tub.\n\n[[Paulie Walnuts]] has been arrested in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]] on a gun charge, and resents Tony's apparent indifference. From a jailhouse payphone, he calls [[Johnny Sack]], who is cultivating his dissatisfaction.\n\n[[Ralphie Cifaretto]] and [[Janice Soprano]] are growing closer. At a Sunday dinner at Tony and Carmela's home, Janice follows Ralphie to the bathroom and joins him for [[cocaine]] and sex--despite Ralphie having shown up with Rosalie Aprile, the woman he's officially still dating. \n\n[[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] believes that Tony is treating him harshly because he questioned his action against [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.]]. He is injecting heroin every day. [[Adriana La Cerva|Adriana]] is now close friends with Danielle, who is actually FBI Agent [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup|Deborah Ciccerone]]. Chris complains that she is always in their home. Adriana takes her to Tony's home and introduces her to him. Junior hears that there was an FBI agent in his doctor's office. He realizes it must have been the nurse he was flirting with, and is mortified that he failed to suspect her.\n\nSpeaking to [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] about business with unusual frankness, Tony says that usually, \"There's two endings for a guy like me. . . Dead or in the can.\"  But there is a third option, to rely \"on blood relations\": he will use his nephew Chris as a buffer between others and himself. As part of what he calls the bonding process, he gives Chris the name and home address of the man, a just-retired policeman, who, Tony says, killed Chris's father. Chris goes to his home and kills him.\n\n==First appearances==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Robert \"Bobby\" Baccalieri III|Bobby Baccalieri, III]]''': Bobby's son\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Karen Baccalieri|Karen Baccalieri]]''': Bobby's wife\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Sophia Baccalieri|Sophia Baccalieri]]''': Bobby's daughter\n*'''[[Carlo Gervasi]]''': Soprano/DiMeo crime family capo\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Murf Lupo|Murf Lupo]]''': Aging former Soprano/DiMeo crime family capo and friend of Junior Soprano\n*'''Cosette''': the dog of Adriana La Cerva\n\n==Deceased==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Detective Barry Haydu|Det.

The episode ends with a close up of a twenty-dollar bill that Christopher takes from Lt. Barry Haydu after he kills him--the only episode in the series to not fade to a black screen.\n\n==Production==\n* This episode was the first to be produced and aired after the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]]. From this episode on, the shot of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in the opening credits is absent, replaced by additional shots of industrial scenery before reaching the toll booth.\n* [[Vince Curatola]] ([[Johnny Sack]]) is now billed in the opening credits, but only for the episodes which he appears in.\n* A comment made by Carmine Lupertazzi to Tony Soprano, \"A [[Mafia don|don]] doesn't wear shorts\", was added into the show after series creator [[David Chase]] was contacted by a supposed real-life mafia associate who praised him on the authenticity of the show, with the exception that Tony often wears shorts, which he said a real don would never do. [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/03/the-sopranos-25-biggest-flaws/the-sopranos-shorts]\n* \"For All Debts Public and Private\" is one of only two ''Sopranos'' episodes in which the end credits roll on top of a picture (the eye of the twenty dollar bill in this case) instead of a black background (the other episode is \"[[Cold Cuts (The Sopranos)|Cold Cuts]]\" from Season 5) and the only episode in which they do so for the entire duration of the credits.\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* [[Bobby Baccala]] mentions the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 as a factor of his 69-year-old mother's deteriorating [[mental health]].\n* Junior is shown watching the movie ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]''.\n* During the scene in which Carmela approaches Tony about finances, the movie playing on the television is ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', a 1959 Western starring [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]] and [[Ricky Nelson]]. In the scene that Tony is watching, Martin and Nelson sing a duet, \"My Rifle, My Pony and Me\". This song is also used at the end of the future episode \"[[Pie-O-My]].\"\n* At Lt. Haydu's house, Chris is shown watching the ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'' episode [[List of Magnum, P.I. episodes|\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\"]].\n* When Paulie is on the payphone in county jail, ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' is seen on the television in the background.\n* During the scene in which Janice and Ralphie are snorting cocaine in the bathroom, Janice comments \"Oh Bartleby, Oh Humanity\"  a reference to the drama surrounding Jackie Jr.'s death. This is the last line from [[Herman Melville]]'s short story \"[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]].\n\n==Music==\n* The song played at the episode's beginning and over the end credits is \"World Destruction\" by [[Time Zone (band)|Time Zone]] (with [[John Lydon]]).\n* The song played while two women make out on a hotel bed is \"Do You Wanna Get Heavy?\" by [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]].\n* The song playing while Bobby and Tony are eating in the diner is \"[[Theme from A Summer Place]]\" by [[Percy Faith]].\n*The song playing while Christopher smokes a heroin-laden cigarette with one of the Icelandic Air Flight Attendants is \"[[Something something (song)|Something something]]\" (2001) by [[Coo_Coo_Cal|Coo Coo Cal]].\n* The song played while Christopher [[shoot up|shoots up]] is \"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\", sung by [[Dean Martin]] in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959).\n* The song playing while Det. Lt. Haydu pulls into his driveway is \"[[Lady Marmalade]]\" by [[Labelle]].\n* The song playing when Carmela sees Angie in the supermarket is \"[[Saturday in the Park (song)|Saturday in the Park]]\" (1972) by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] from their album ''[[Chicago V]]''.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/4/40-for-all-debts-public-and-private/index.html \"For All Debts Public and Private\"] at [[HBO]]\n*{{imdb episode|0705245}}\n*{{tv.com episode|the-sopranos/for-all-debts-public-and-private-183957}}\n\n{{The Sopranos}}\n\n[[Category:The Sopranos (season 4) episodes]]\n[[Category:2002 American television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "April 31st", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSynopsis:changed wording", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Debts_Public_and_Private"}

He continued in this role under Olsson's successor, John-Anders Sj\u00f6gren from 1989 to 1994. At the start of 1995, Hageskog was appointed as Davis Cup captain, a position he held until the end of 2002. He captained Sweden to the finals of the Davis Cup in [[1996 Davis Cup|1996]], [[1997 Davis Cup|1997]] and [[1998 Davis Cup|1998]], winning the title in 1997 and 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/teams/team.aspx?id=SWE|title=Davis Cup - Teams|website=www.daviscup.com|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Hageskog began coaching fellow Swede [[Anders J\u00e4rryd]] and continued to do so for ten years. J\u00e4rryd, who was already a top ten player, reached a career high [[ATP Rankings|ATP ranking]] of no. 5 in July 1985. During the course of their coaching partnership, J\u00e4rryd was particularly successful in doubles and reached eleven [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles finals. In January 1992 Hageskog also began coaching [[Henrik Holm]]. At the time Holm had an ATP ranking of 130 and under Hageskog's guidance he reached a career high of no. 17 in July 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atptour.com/en/players/henrik-holm/h191/overview|title=Henrik Holm {{!}} Overview {{!}} ATP Tour {{!}} Tennis|website=ATP Tour|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> \n\nAfter his coaching period with J\u00e4rryd and Holm came to an end, Hageskog began coaching the world no. 39, [[Magnus Larsson]].

During a further loan spell at [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]], he was banned from football for life for attacking a Belgian [[referee (association football)|referee]], although the ban was later substantially reduced.\n\nIn 2002, Wallwork moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], where he was the Player of the Year for [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. He was not always a regular in the side however, and spent time on loan at [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. His spell at Barnsley was cut short when he was [[stabbed]] in a nightclub, causing him to miss more than two months of the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.

He represented his country at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.<ref name=\"SportsRef\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/fons-de-wolf-1.html |title=Alfons De Wolf Olympic Results |accessdate=22 April 2015 |work=Sports Reference}}</ref>\n\nHe was forecast, with [[Daniel Willems]], to be the successor to [[Eddy Merckx]]. De Wolf seemed to fulfill that promise by having an absolutely dominant [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]] winning 5 stages including an individual time trial as well as the Points Classification, securing a top 10 place in the General Classification and then following it up by winning the 1980 [[Giro di Lombardia]] and the 1981 [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], the last and first classic of the season. He almost won the 1982 [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], beaten by Italian [[Silvano Contini]] in the final sprint.\n\nAfter winning a stage in the 1984 [[Tour de France]], his career faded. He helped his teammate [[Eddy Planckaert]] win the [[green jersey]] in the [[1988 Tour de France]]. He ended his career in 1990.\n\nHe now helps his wife in her funeral parlour in [[Dworp]], in the south of [[Brussels]].\n\nAlthough he won the [[Omloop Het Nieuwsblad|Omloop Het Volk]] two times, De Wolf was an atypical Flemish cyclist, preferring Italian races such as Milan\u2013San Remo to [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] and the [[Tour of Flanders]]. He was at ease in hilly races, though he was not an impressive climber.\n\nHe complained that he was seen as a 'new Eddy Merckx', that the public had expected too much.\n\n==Major results==\n{{div

([[1979 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|1979]])\n}}\n'''Alfons (\"Fons\") De Wolf''' (born 22 June 1956 in [[Willebroek]]) is a retired [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[bicycle racing|road race cyclist]], a professional from 1979 to 1990. He represented his country at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.<ref name=\"SportsRef\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/fons-de-wolf-1.html |title=Alfons De Wolf Olympic Results |accessdate=22 April 2015 |work=Sports Reference}}</ref>\n\nHe was forecast, with [[Daniel Willems]], to be the successor to [[Eddy Merckx]]. De Wolf seemed to fulfill that promise by having an absolutely dominant [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]] winning 5 stages including an individual time trial as well as the Points Classification, securing a top 10 place in the General Classification and then following it up by winning the 1980 [[Giro di Lombardia]] and the 1981 [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], the last and first classic of the season. He almost won the 1982 [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], beaten by Italian [[Silvano Contini]] in the final sprint.\n\nAfter winning a stage in the 1984 [[Tour de France]], his career faded. He helped his teammate [[Eddy Planckaert]] win the [[green jersey]] in the [[1988 Tour de France]]. He ended his career in 1990.\n\nHe now helps his wife in her funeral parlour in [[Dworp]], in the south of [[Brussels]].\n\nAlthough he won the [[Omloop Het Nieuwsblad|Omloop Het Volk]] two times, De Wolf was an atypical Flemish cyclist, preferring Italian races such as Milan\u2013San Remo to [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] and the [[Tour of Flanders]]. He was at ease in hilly races, though he was not an impressive climber.\n\nHe complained that he was seen as a 'new Eddy Merckx', that the public had expected too much.\n\n==Major results==\n{{div

{"title_page": "Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition", "text_new": "In mathematics, the '''Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition''', named after [[Camille Jordan]] and [[Claude Chevalley]], expresses a [[linear operator]] as the sum of its commuting [[Semi-simple operator|semisimple]] part and its [[nilpotent]] parts. The multiplicative decomposition expresses an invertible operator as the product of its commuting semisimple and unipotent parts. The decomposition is easy to describe when the [[Jordan normal form]] of the operator is given, but it exists under weaker hypotheses than the existence of a Jordan normal form. Analogues of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition exist for elements of [[linear algebraic group]]s, [[Lie algebra]]s, and [[Lie group]]s, and the decomposition is an important tool in the study of these objects.\n\n== Decomposition of a linear operator ==\nConsider linear operators on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over a field. An operator T is [[Semisimple operator|semisimple]] if every T-invariant subspace has a complementary T-invariant subspace (if the underlying field is [[algebraically closed]], this is the same as the requirement that the operator be [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]]). An operator ''x'' is ''[[nilpotent]]'' if some power ''x''<sup>''m''</sup> of it is the zero operator. An operator ''x'' is ''[[unipotent]]'' if ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is nilpotent.\n\nNow, let ''x'' be any operator. A Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition of ''x'' is an expression of it as a sum\n:''x'' = ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>,\nwhere ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> is semisimple, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is nilpotent, and ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> commute. Over a [[perfect field]],<ref>In fact, the proof goes through if the quotient <math>k[x]/\\text{nil}</math> is a separable algebra; see [[#Short proof using abstract algebra]].</ref> such a decomposition exists (cf. [[#Proof of uniqueness and existence]]), the decomposition is unique, and the ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are polynomials in ''x'' with no constant terms.<ref name=Humphreys>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1972|loc=Prop. 4.2, p. 17}} for the algebraically closed field case.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Waterhouse|loc=Ch. 9, Exercise 1.}}</ref> In particular, for any such decomposition over a perfect field, an operator that commutes with ''x'' also commutes with ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nIf ''x'' is an invertible operator, then a multiplicative Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition expresses ''x'' as a product\n:''x'' = ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> \u00b7 ''x''<sub>u</sub>,\nwhere ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> is semisimple, ''x''<sub>u</sub> is unipotent, and ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''u''</sub>  commute. Again, over a perfect field, such a decomposition exists, the decomposition is unique, and ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>u</sub> are polynomials in ''x''. The multiplicative version of the decomposition follows from the additive one since, as <math>x_s</math> is easily seen to be invertible,\n:<math>x = x_s + x_n = x_s(1 + x_s^{-1}x_n)</math>\nand <math>1 + x_s^{-1}x_n</math> is unipotent. (Conversely, by the same type of argument, one can deduce the additive version from the multiplicative one.)\n\nIf ''x'' is written in [[Jordan normal form]] (with respect to some basis) then ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix contains just the diagonal terms of ''x'', and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix contains just the off-diagonal terms; ''x''<sub>''u''</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix is obtained from the Jordan normal form by dividing all entries of each Jordan block by its diagonal element.\n\n=== Proof of uniqueness and existence ===\nThe uniqueness follows from the fact <math>x_s, x_n</math> are polynomial in ''x'': if <math>x = x_s' + x_n'</math> is another decomposition such that <math>x'_s</math> and <math>x'_n</math> commute, then <math>x_s - x_s' = x_n' - x_n</math>, and both <math>x_s',x_n'</math> commute with ''x'', hence with  <math>x_s,x_n</math>. Now, the sum of commuting semisimple (resp. nilpotent) endomorphisms is again semisimple (resp. nilpotent). Since the only operator which is both semisimple and nilpotent is the zero operator it follows that <math>x_s = x_s'</math> and <math>x_n = x_n'</math>.\n\nWe show the existence. Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a perfect field ''k'' and <math>x : V \\to V</math> an endomorphism.\n\nFirst assume the base field ''k'' is algebraically closed. Then the vector space ''V'' has the direct sum decomposition <math>V = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^r V_i</math> where each <math>V_i</math> is the kernel of <math>(x - \\lambda_i I)^{m_i}</math>, the [[generalized eigenspace]] and ''x'' stabilizes <math>V_i</math>, meaning <math>x \\cdot V_i \\subset V_i</math>. Now, define <math>x_s : V \\to V</math> so that, on each <math>V_i</math>, it is the scalar multiplication by <math>\\lambda_i</math>. Note that, in terms of a basis respecting the direct sum decomposition, <math>x_s</math> is a diagonal matrix; hence, it is a semisimple endomorphism. Since <math>x - x_s : V_i \\to V_i</math> is then <math>x - \\lambda_i I : V_i \\to V_i</math> whose <math>m_i</math>-th power is zero, we also have that <math>x_n := x - x_s</math> is nilpotent, establishing the existence of the decomposition.\n\n(Choosing a basis carefully on each <math>V_i</math>, one can then put ''x'' in the Jordan normal form and <math>x_s, x_n</math> are the diagonal and the off-diagonal parts of the normal form. But this is not needed here.)\n\nThe fact that <math>x_s, x_n</math> are polynomials in ''x'' follows from the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. Indeed, \nlet <math>f(t) = \\operatorname{det}(t I - x)</math> be the [[characteristic polynomial]] of ''x''. Then it is the product of the characteristic polynomials of <math>x : V_i \\to V_i</math>; i.e., <math>f(t) = \\prod_{i=1}^r (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}, d_i = \\dim V_i.</math> Also, <math>d_i \\ge m_i</math> (because, in general, a nilpotent matrix is killed when raised to the size of the matrix). Now, the Chinese remainder theorem applied to the polynomial ring <math>k[t]</math> gives a polynomial <math>p(t)</math> satisfying the conditions\n:<math>p(t) \\equiv 0 \\bmod t, \\, p(t) \\equiv \\lambda_i \\bmod (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}</math> (for all i).\n(There is a redundancy in the conditions if some <math>\\lambda_i</math> is zero but that is not an issue; just remove it from the conditions.)\n\nThe condition <math>p(t) \\equiv \\lambda_i \\bmod (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}</math>, when spelled out, means that <math>p(t) - \\lambda_i = g_i(t) (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}</math> for some polynomial <math>g_i(t)</math>. Since <math>(x - \\lambda_i I)^{d_i}</math> is the zero map on <math>V_i</math>, <math>p(x)</math> and <math>x_s</math> agree on each <math>V_i</math>; i.e., <math>p(x) = x_s</math>. Also then <math>q(x) = x_n</math> with <math>q(t) = t - p(t)</math>.  The condition <math>p(t) \\equiv 0 \\bmod t</math> ensures that <math>p(t)</math> and <math>q(t)</math> have no constant terms. This completes the proof of the algebraically closed field case.\n\nIf ''k'' is an arbitrary perfect field, let <math>\\Gamma = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\overline{k}/k)</math> be the absolute Galois group of ''k''. By the first part, we can choose polynomials <math>p, q</math> over <math>\\overline{k}</math> such that <math>x = p(x) + q(x)</math> is the decomposition into the semisimple and nilpotent part. For each <math>\\sigma</math> in <math>\\Gamma</math>,\n:<math>x = \\sigma(x) = \\sigma(p(x)) + \\sigma(q(x)) = p(x) + q(x).</math>\nNow, <math>\\sigma(p(x)) = \\sigma(p)(x)</math> is a polynomial in <math>x</math>; so is <math>\\sigma(q(x))</math>. Thus, <math>\\sigma(p(x))</math> and <math>\\sigma(q(x))</math> commute. Also, the application of <math>\\sigma</math> evidently preserves semisimplicity and nilpotency. Thus, by the uniqueness of decomposition (over <math>\\overline{k}</math>), <math>\\sigma(p(x)) = p(x)</math> and <math>\\sigma(q(x)) = q(x)</math>. Hence, <math>x_s = p(x), x_n = q(x)</math> are <math>\\Gamma</math>-invariant; i.e., they are endomorphisms (represented by matrices) over ''k''. Finally, since <math>\\{ 1, x, x^2, \\dots \\}</math> contains a <math>\\overline{k}</math>-basis that spans the space containing <math>x_s, x_n</math>, by the same argument, we also see that <math>p, q</math> have coefficients in ''k''. This completes the proof. <math>\\square</math>\n\n=== Short proof using abstract algebra ===\n{{harv|Jacobson|1979}} proves the existence of a decomposition as a consequence of the [[Wedderburn principal theorem]]. (This approach is not only short but also makes the role of the assumption that the base field be perfect clearer.)\n\nLet ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a perfect field ''k'', <math>x : V \\to V</math> an endomorphism and <math>A = k[x] \\subset \\operatorname{End}(V)</math> the subalgebra generated by ''x''. Note that ''A'' is a commutative [[Artinian ring]]. The Wedderburn principal theorem states: for a finite-dimensional algebra ''A'' with the Jacobson radical ''J'', if <math>A/J</math> is separable, then the natural surjection <math>p: A \\to A/J</math> splits; i.e., <math>A</math> contains a [[semisimple algebra|semisimple subalgebra]] <math>B</math> such that <math>p|_B : B \\overset{\\sim}\\to A/J</math> is an isomorphism.<ref> https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKGq4IQHhHUC&pg=PA143&dq=wedderburn+principal+theorem&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=wedderburn%20principal%20theorem&f=false</ref> In the setup here, <math>A/J</math> is separable since the base field is perfect (so the theorem is applicable) and ''J'' is also the nilradical of ''A''. There is then the vector-space decomposition <math>A = B \\oplus J</math>. In particular, the endomorphism ''x'' can be written as <math>x = x_s + x_n</math> where <math>x_s</math> is in <math>B</math> and <math>x_n</math> in <math>J</math>. Now, the image of ''x'' generates <math>A/J \\simeq B</math>; thus <math>x_s</math> is semisimple and is a polynomial of ''x''. Also, <math>x_n</math> is nilpotent since <math>J</math> is nilpotent and is a polynomial of ''x'' since <math>x_s</math> is. <math>\\square</math>\n\n=== Nilpotency criterion ===\nThe Jordan decomposition can be used to characterize nilpotency of an endomorphism. Let ''k'' be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, <math>E = \\operatorname{End}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(k)</math> the endomorphism ring of ''k'' and ''V'' a finite-dimensional vector space over ''k''. Given an endomorphism <math>x : V \\to V</math>, let <math>x = s + n</math> be the Jordan decomposition.

Example: Let ''p'' be a prime number, let ''k'' be imperfect of characteristic ''p'', and choose ''a'' in ''k'' that is not a ''p''th power.  Let ''V = k[x]/(x<sup>p</sup>-a)<sup>2</sup>'', and let ''T'' be the ''k''-linear operator given by multiplication by ''x'' on ''V''.  This has as its stable ''k''-linear subspaces precisely the ideals of ''V'' viewed as a ring.  Suppose ''T=S+N'' for commuting ''k''-linear operators ''S'' and ''N'' that are respectively semisimple (just over ''k'', which is weaker than semisimplicity over an algebraic closure of ''k'') and nilpotent.  Since ''S'' and ''N'' commute, they each commute with ''T=S+N'' and hence each acts ''k[x]''-linearly on ''V''.  Thus, each preserves the unique nonzero proper ''k[x]''-submodule ''J=(x<sup>p</sup>-a)V'' in ''V''.  But by semisimplicity of ''S'', there would have to be an ''S''-stable ''k''-linear complement to ''J''.  However, by ''k[x]''-linearity, ''S'' and ''N'' are each given by multiplication against the respective polynomials ''s = S(1)'' and ''n =N(1)'' whose induced effects on the quotient ''V/(x<sup>p</sup>-a)'' must be respectively ''x'' and ''0'' since this quotient is a field.  Hence, ''s = x + (x<sup>p</sup>-a)h(x)'' for some polynomial ''h(x)'' (which only matters modulo ''(x<sup>p</sup>-a)''), so it is easily seen{{dubious|date=July 2016}} that ''s'' generates ''V'' as a ''k''-algebra and thus the ''S''-stable ''k''-linear subspaces of ''V'' are precisely the ''k[x]''-submodules.  It follows that an ''S''-stable complement to ''J'' is also a ''k[x]''-submodule of ''V'', contradicting that ''J'' is the only nonzero proper ''k[x]''-submodule of ''V''.  Thus, there is no decomposition of ''T'' as a sum of commuting ''k''-linear operators that are respectively semisimple and nilpotent.\n\n== Analogous decompositions ==\nThe multiplicative version of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition generalizes to a decomposition in a linear algebraic group, and the additive version of the decomposition generalizes to a decomposition in a Lie algebra.\n\n=== Lie algebras ===\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> denote the Lie algebra of the endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' over a perfect field.

The multiplicative decomposition expresses an invertible operator as the product of its commuting semisimple and unipotent parts. The decomposition is easy to describe when the [[Jordan normal form]] of the operator is given, but it exists under weaker hypotheses than the existence of a Jordan normal form. Analogues of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition exist for elements of [[linear algebraic group]]s, [[Lie algebra]]s, and [[Lie group]]s, and the decomposition is an important tool in the study of these objects.\n\n== Decomposition of a linear operator ==\nConsider linear operators on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over a field. An operator T is [[Semisimple operator|semisimple]] if every T-invariant subspace has a complementary T-invariant subspace (if the underlying field is [[algebraically closed]], this is the same as the requirement that the operator be [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]]). An operator ''x'' is ''[[nilpotent]]'' if some power ''x''<sup>''m''</sup> of it is the zero operator. An operator ''x'' is ''[[unipotent]]'' if ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is nilpotent.\n\nNow, let ''x'' be any operator. A Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition of ''x'' is an expression of it as a sum\n:''x'' = ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>,\nwhere ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> is semisimple, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is nilpotent, and ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> commute. Over a [[perfect field]],<ref>In fact, the proof goes through if the quotient <math>k[x]/\\text{nil}</math> is a separable algebra; see [[#Short proof using abstract algebra]].</ref> such a decomposition exists (cf. [[#Proof of uniqueness and existence]]), the decomposition is unique, and the ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are polynomials in ''x'' with no constant terms.<ref name=Humphreys>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1972|loc=Prop. 4.2, p. 17}} for the algebraically closed field case.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Waterhouse|loc=Ch. 9, Exercise 1.}}</ref> In particular, for any such decomposition over a perfect field, an operator that commutes with ''x'' also commutes with ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nIf ''x'' is an invertible operator, then a multiplicative Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition expresses ''x'' as a product\n:''x'' = ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> \u00b7 ''x''<sub>u</sub>,\nwhere ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> is semisimple, ''x''<sub>u</sub> is unipotent, and ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>''u''</sub>  commute. Again, over a perfect field, such a decomposition exists, the decomposition is unique, and ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> and ''x''<sub>u</sub> are polynomials in ''x''. The multiplicative version of the decomposition follows from the additive one since, as <math>x_s</math> is easily seen to be invertible,\n:<math>x = x_s + x_n = x_s(1 + x_s^{-1}x_n)</math>\nand <math>1 + x_s^{-1}x_n</math> is unipotent. (Conversely, by the same type of argument, one can deduce the additive version from the multiplicative one.)\n\nIf ''x'' is written in [[Jordan normal form]] (with respect to some basis) then ''x''<sub>''s''</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix contains just the diagonal terms of ''x'', and ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix contains just the off-diagonal terms; ''x''<sub>''u''</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix is obtained from the Jordan normal form by dividing all entries of each Jordan block by its diagonal element.\n\n=== Proof of uniqueness and existence ===\nThe uniqueness follows from the fact <math>x_s, x_n</math> are polynomial in ''x'': if <math>x = x_s' + x_n'</math> is another decomposition such that <math>x'_s</math> and <math>x'_n</math> commute, then <math>x_s - x_s' = x_n' - x_n</math>, and both <math>x_s',x_n'</math> commute with ''x'', hence with  <math>x_s,x_n</math>. Now, the sum of commuting semisimple (resp. nilpotent) endomorphisms is again semisimple (resp. nilpotent). Since the only operator which is both semisimple and nilpotent is the zero operator it follows that <math>x_s = x_s'</math> and <math>x_n = x_n'</math>.\n\nWe show the existence. Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a perfect field ''k'' and <math>x : V \\to V</math> an endomorphism.\n\nFirst assume the base field ''k'' is algebraically closed. Then the vector space ''V'' has the direct sum decomposition <math>V = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^r V_i</math> where each <math>V_i</math> is the kernel of <math>(x - \\lambda_i I)^{m_i}</math>, the [[generalized eigenspace]] and ''x'' stabilizes <math>V_i</math>, meaning <math>x \\cdot V_i \\subset V_i</math>. Now, define <math>x_s : V \\to V</math> so that, on each <math>V_i</math>, it is the scalar multiplication by <math>\\lambda_i</math>. Note that, in terms of a basis respecting the direct sum decomposition, <math>x_s</math> is a diagonal matrix; hence, it is a semisimple endomorphism. Since <math>x - x_s : V_i \\to V_i</math> is then <math>x - \\lambda_i I : V_i \\to V_i</math> whose <math>m_i</math>-th power is zero, we also have that <math>x_n := x - x_s</math> is nilpotent, establishing the existence of the decomposition.\n\n(Choosing a basis carefully on each <math>V_i</math>, one can then put ''x'' in the Jordan normal form and <math>x_s, x_n</math> are the diagonal and the off-diagonal parts of the normal form. But this is not needed here.)\n\nThe fact that <math>x_s, x_n</math> are polynomials in ''x'' follows from the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. Indeed, \nlet <math>f(t) = \\operatorname{det}(t I - x)</math> be the [[characteristic polynomial]] of ''x''. Then it is the product of the characteristic polynomials of <math>x : V_i \\to V_i</math>; i.e., <math>f(t) = \\prod_{i=1}^r (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}, d_i = \\dim V_i.</math> Also, <math>d_i \\ge m_i</math> (because, in general, a nilpotent matrix is killed when raised to the size of the matrix). Now, the Chinese remainder theorem applied to the polynomial ring <math>k[t]</math> gives a polynomial <math>p(t)</math> satisfying the conditions\n:<math>p(t) \\equiv 0 \\bmod t, \\, p(t) \\equiv \\lambda_i \\bmod (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}.</math>\n(there is a redundancy in the conditions if some <math>\\lambda_i</math> is zero but that is not an issue; just remove it from the conditions.)\n\nThe condition <math>p(t) \\equiv \\lambda_i \\bmod (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}</math>, when spelled out, means that <math>p(t) - \\lambda_i = g_i(t) (t - \\lambda_i)^{d_i}</math> for some polynomial <math>g_i(t)</math>. Since <math>(x - \\lambda_i I)^{d_i}</math> is the zero map on <math>V_i</math>, <math>p(x)</math> and <math>x_s</math> agree on each <math>V_i</math>; i.e., <math>p(x) = x_s</math>. Also then <math>q(x) = x_n</math> with <math>q(t) = t - p(t)</math>.  The condition <math>p(t) \\equiv 0 \\bmod t</math> ensures that <math>p(t)</math> and <math>q(t)</math> have no constant terms. This completes the proof of the algebraically closed field case.\n\nIf ''k'' is an arbitrary perfect field, let <math>\\Gamma = \\operatorname{Gal}(\\overline{k}/k)</math> be the absolute Galois group of ''k''. By the first part, we can choose polynomials <math>p, q</math> over <math>\\overline{k}</math> such that <math>x = p(x) + q(x)</math> is the decomposition into the semisimple and nilpotent part. For each <math>\\sigma</math> in <math>\\Gamma</math>,\n:<math>x = \\sigma(x) = \\sigma(p(x)) + \\sigma(q(x)) = p(x) + q(x).</math>\nNow, <math>\\sigma(p(x)) = \\sigma(p)(x)</math> is a polynomial in <math>x</math>; so is <math>\\sigma(q(x))</math>. Thus, <math>\\sigma(p(x))</math> and <math>\\sigma(q(x))</math> commute. Also, the application of <math>\\sigma</math> evidently preserves semisimplicity and nilpotency. Thus, by the uniqueness of decomposition (over <math>\\overline{k}</math>), <math>\\sigma(p(x)) = p(x)</math> and <math>\\sigma(q(x)) = q(x)</math>. Hence, <math>x_s = p(x), x_n = q(x)</math> are <math>\\Gamma</math>-invariant; i.e., they are endomorphisms (represented by matrices) over ''k''. Finally, since <math>\\{ 1, x, x^2, \\dots \\}</math> contains a <math>\\overline{k}</math>-basis that spans the space containing <math>x_s, x_n</math>, by the same argument, we also see that <math>p, q</math> have coefficients in ''k''. This completes the proof. <math>\\square</math>\n\n=== Short proof using abstract algebra ===\n{{harv|Jacobson|1979}} proves the existence of a decomposition as a consequence of the [[Wedderburn principal theorem]]. (This approach is not only short but also makes the role of the assumption that the base field be perfect clearer.)\n\nLet ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over a perfect field ''k'', <math>x : V \\to V</math> an endomorphism and <math>A = k[x] \\subset \\operatorname{End}(V)</math> the subalgebra generated by ''x''. Note that ''A'' is a commutative [[Artinian ring]]. The Wedderburn principal theorem states: for a finite-dimensional algebra ''A'' with the Jacobson radical ''J'', if <math>A/J</math> is separable, then the natural surjection <math>p: A \\to A/J</math> splits; i.e., <math>A</math> contains a [[semisimple algebra|semisimple subalgebra]] <math>B</math> such that <math>p|_B : B \\overset{\\sim}\\to A/J</math> is an isomorphism.<ref> https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKGq4IQHhHUC&pg=PA143&dq=wedderburn+principal+theorem&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=wedderburn%20principal%20theorem&f=false</ref> In the setup here, <math>A/J</math> is separable since the base field is perfect (so the theorem is applicable) and ''J'' is also the nilradical of ''A''. There is then the vector-space decomposition <math>A = B \\oplus J</math>. In particular, the endomorphism ''x'' can be written as <math>x = x_s + x_n</math> where <math>x_s</math> is in <math>B</math> and <math>x_n</math> in <math>J</math>. Now, the image of ''x'' generates <math>A/J \\simeq B</math>; thus <math>x_s</math> is semisimple and is a polynomial of ''x''. Also, <math>x_n</math> is nilpotent since <math>J</math> is nilpotent and is a polynomial of ''x'' since <math>x_s</math> is. <math>\\square</math>\n\n=== Nilpotency criterion ===\nThe Jordan decomposition can be used to characterize nilpotency of an endomorphism. Let ''k'' be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, <math>E = \\operatorname{End}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(k)</math> the endomorphism ring of ''k'' and ''V'' a finite-dimensional vector space over ''k''. Given an endomorphism <math>x : V \\to V</math>, let <math>x = s + n</math> be the Jordan decomposition. Then <math>s</math> is diagonalizable; i.e., <math>V = \\bigoplus V_i</math> where each <math>V_i</math> is the eigenspace for eigenvalue <math>\\lambda_i</math> with multiplicity <math>m_i</math>. Then let <math>\\varphi(s) : V \\to V</math> be the endomorphism such that <math>\\varphi(s) : V_i \\to V_i</math> is the multiplication by <math>\\varphi(\\lambda_i)</math>. Chevalley calls <math>\\varphi(s)</math> the '''replica''' of <math>s</math> given by <math>\\varphi</math>. (For example, if <math>k = \\mathbb{C}</math>, then the complex conjugate of an endomorphism is an example of a replica.) Now,\n\n{{math_theorem|name=Nilpotency criterion|math_statement|<ref>{{harvnb|Serre|loc=LA 5.17. Lemma 6.7.}} The endomorphism </ref><math>x</math> is nilpotent (i.e., <math>s = 0</math>) if and only if <math>\\operatorname{tr}(x \\varphi(s)) = 0</math> for every <math>\\varphi \\in E</math>. Also, if <math>k = \\mathbb{C}</math>, then it suffices the condition holds for <math>\\varphi = </math> complex conjugation.}}\n\n''Proof:'' First, since <math>n \\varphi(s)</math> is nilpotent,\n:<math>0 = \\operatorname{tr}(x \\varphi(s)) = \\sum_i \\operatorname{tr}(s \\varphi(s) | V_i) = \\sum_i m_i \\lambda_i \\varphi(\\lambda_i)</math>.\nIf <math>\\varphi</math> is the complex conjugation, this implies <math>\\lambda_i = 0</math> for every ''i''. Otherwise, take <math>\\varphi</math> to be a <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>-linear functional <math>\\varphi : k \\to \\mathbb{Q}</math> followed by <math>\\mathbb{Q} \\hookrightarrow k</math>. Applying that to the above equation, one gets:\n:<math>\\sum_i m_i \\varphi(\\lambda_i)^2 = 0</math>\nand, since <math>\\varphi(\\lambda_i)</math> are all real numbers, <math>\\varphi(\\lambda_i) = 0</math> for every ''i''. Varying the linear functionals then implies <math>\\lambda_i = 0</math> for every ''i''. <math>\\square</math>\n\nA typical application of the above criterion is the proof of [[Cartan's criterion for solvability]] of a Lie algebra. It says: if <math>\\mathfrak{g} \\subset \\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> is a Lie subalgebra over a field ''k'' of characteristic zero such that <math>\\operatorname{tr}(xy) = 0</math> for each <math>x \\in \\mathfrak{g}, y \\in D \\mathfrak{g} = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]</math>, then <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is solvable.\n\n''Proof:''<ref>{{harvnb|Serre|loc=LA 5.19. Theorem 7.1.}}</ref> Without loss of generality, assume ''k'' is algebraically closed. By [[Lie's theorem]] and [[Engel's theorem]], it suffices to show for each <math>x \\in D \\mathfrak g</math>, <math>x</math> is a nilpotent endomorphism of ''V''. Write <math>x = \\sum_i [x_i, y_i]</math>. Then we need to show:\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}(x \\varphi(s)) = \\sum_i \\operatorname{tr}([x_i, y_i] \\varphi(s)) = \\sum_i \\operatorname{tr}(x_i [y_i, \\varphi(s)])</math>\nis zero. Let <math>\\mathfrak{g}' = \\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math>. Note we have: <math>\\operatorname{ad}_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) : \\mathfrak{g} \\to D \\mathfrak{g}</math> and, since <math>\\operatorname{ad}_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(s)</math> is the semisimple part of the Jordan decomposition of <math>\\operatorname{ad}_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x)</math>, it follows that <math>\\operatorname{ad}_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(s)</math> is a polynomial without constant term in <math>\\operatorname{ad}_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x)</math>; hence, <math>\\operatorname{ad}_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(s) : \\mathfrak{g} \\to D \\mathfrak{g}</math> and the same is true with <math>\\varphi(s)</math> in place of <math>s</math>. That is, <math>[\\varphi(s), \\mathfrak{g}] \\subset D \\mathfrak{g}</math>, which implies the claim given the assumption. <math>\\square</math>\n\n===Counterexample to existence over an imperfect field ===\nIf the ground field is not [[perfect field|perfect]], then a Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition may not exist. Example: Let ''p'' be a prime number, let ''k'' be imperfect of characteristic ''p'', and choose ''a'' in ''k'' that is not a ''p''th power.  Let ''V = k[x]/(x<sup>p</sup>-a)<sup>2</sup>'', and let ''T'' be the ''k''-linear operator given by multiplication by ''x'' on ''V''.  This has as its stable ''k''-linear subspaces precisely the ideals of ''V'' viewed as a ring.  Suppose ''T=S+N'' for commuting ''k''-linear operators ''S'' and ''N'' that are respectively semisimple (just over ''k'', which is weaker than semisimplicity over an algebraic closure of ''k'') and nilpotent.  Since ''S'' and ''N'' commute, they each commute with ''T=S+N'' and hence each acts ''k[x]''-linearly on ''V''.  Thus, each preserves the unique nonzero proper ''k[x]''-submodule ''J=(x<sup>p</sup>-a)V'' in ''V''.  But by semisimplicity of ''S'', there would have to be an ''S''-stable ''k''-linear complement to ''J''.  However, by ''k[x]''-linearity, ''S'' and ''N'' are each given by multiplication against the respective polynomials ''s = S(1)'' and ''n =N(1)'' whose induced effects on the quotient ''V/(x<sup>p</sup>-a)'' must be respectively ''x'' and ''0'' since this quotient is a field.  Hence, ''s = x + (x<sup>p</sup>-a)h(x)'' for some polynomial ''h(x)'' (which only matters modulo ''(x<sup>p</sup>-a)''), so it is easily seen{{dubious|date=July 2016}} that ''s'' generates ''V'' as a ''k''-algebra and thus the ''S''-stable ''k''-linear subspaces of ''V'' are precisely the ''k[x]''-submodules.  It follows that an ''S''-stable complement to ''J'' is also a ''k[x]''-submodule of ''V'', contradicting that ''J'' is the only nonzero proper ''k[x]''-submodule of ''V''.  Thus, there is no decomposition of ''T'' as a sum of commuting ''k''-linear operators that are respectively semisimple and nilpotent.\n\n== Analogous decompositions ==\nThe multiplicative version of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition generalizes to a decomposition in a linear algebraic group, and the additive version of the decomposition generalizes to a decomposition in a Lie algebra.\n\n=== Lie algebras ===\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> denote the Lie algebra of the endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' over a perfect field. If <math>x = x_s + x_n</math> is the Jordan decomposition, then <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x) = \\operatorname{ad}(x_s) + \\operatorname{ad}(x_n)</math> is the Jordan decomposition of <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)</math> on the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math>. Indeed, first, <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x_s)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x_n)</math> commute since <math>[\\operatorname{ad}(x_s), \\operatorname{ad}(x_n)] = \\operatorname{ad}([x_s, x_n]) = 0</math>. Second, in general, for each endomorphism <math>y \\in \\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math>, we have:\n# If <math>y^m = 0</math>, then <math>\\operatorname{ad}(y)^{2m-1} = 0</math>, since <math>\\operatorname{ad}(y)</math> is the difference of the left and right multiplications by ''y''.\n# If <math>y</math> is semisimple, then <math>\\operatorname{ad}(y)</math> is semisimple.<ref>This is not easy to see but is shown in the proof of {{harv|Jacobson|loc=Ch. III, \u00a7 7, Theorem 11.}}. Editorial note: we need to add a discussion of this matter to \u201c[[semisimple operator]]\u201d.</ref>\nHence, by uniqueness, <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)_s = \\operatorname{ad}(x_s)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)_n = \\operatorname{ad}(x_n)</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\pi: \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> is a finite-dimensional representation of a [[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] finite-dimensional complex<!-- need a ref for a non-complex base --> Lie algebra, then <math>\\pi</math> preserves the Jordan decomposition in the sense: if <math>x = x_s + x_n</math>, then <math>\\pi(x_s) = \\pi(x)_s</math> and <math>\\pi(x_n) = \\pi(x)_n</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Fulton|Harris|Theorem 9.20.}}</ref>\n\n==== Real semisimple Lie algebras ====\nIn the formulation of Chevalley and [[George Mostow|Mostow]], the additive decomposition states that an element ''X'' in a real [[semisimple Lie algebra]] '''g''' with [[Iwasawa decomposition]] '''g''' = '''k''' \u2295 '''a''' \u2295 '''n'''   can be written as the sum of three commuting elements of the Lie algebra ''X'' = ''S'' + ''D'' + ''N'', with ''S'', ''D'' and ''N'' conjugate to elements in '''k''', '''a''' and '''n''' respectively. In general the terms in the Iwasawa decomposition do not commute.\n\n=== Linear algebraic groups ===\nLet <math>G</math> be a linear algebraic group over a perfect field. Then, essentially by definition, there is a closed embedding <math>G \\hookrightarrow \\mathbf{GL}_n</math>. Now, to each element <math>g \\in G</math>, by the multiplicative Jordan decomposition, there are a pair of a semisimple element <math>g_s</math> and a unipotent element <math>g_u</math> ''a priori'' in <math>\\mathbf{GL}_n</math> such that <math>g = g_s g_u = g_u g_s</math>. But, as it turns out,<ref>{{harvnb|Waterhouse|loc=Theorem 9.2.}}</ref> the elements <math>g_s, g_u</math> can be shown to be in <math>G</math> (i.e., they satisfy the defining equations of ''G'') and that they are independent of the embedding into <math>\\mathbf{GL}_n</math>; i.e., the decomposition is intrinsic.\n\nWhen ''G'' is abelian, <math>G</math> is then the direct product of the closed subgroup of the semisimple elements in ''G'' and that of unipotent elements.<ref>{{harvnb|Waterhouse|loc=Theorem 9.3.}}</ref>\n\n==== Real semisimple Lie groups ====\nThe multiplicative decomposition states that if ''g'' is an element of the corresponding connected semisimple Lie group ''G'' with corresponding Iwasawa decomposition ''G'' = ''KAN'', then ''g'' can be written as the product of three commuting elements ''g'' = ''sdu'' with ''s'', ''d'' and ''u'' conjugate to elements of ''K'', ''A'' and ''N'' respectively. In general the terms in the Iwasawa decomposition ''g'' = ''kan'' do not commute.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{citation|last=Chevalley|first= Claude|title= Th\u00e9orie des groupes de Lie.
