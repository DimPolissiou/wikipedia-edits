The squadron flew in China until Christmas, when the squadron was inactivated after operating more than 20 months in Asia. The squadron earned battle streamers and won citations during [[World War II|WWII]].<ref name=913AGref />  \n\nThe squadron remained inactive until the spring of 1947, when it was reactivated at [[Dobbins Air Reserve Base|Marietta Army Air Field]], Ga., and equipped with [[C-46]]s. It was assigned to the 514th Troop Carrier Wing for two and half years.<ref name=913AGref /> \n\nIn 1949, the 327th moved to [[Reading Municipal Airport]], [[Pennsylvania]] and joined the 512th Troop Carrier Wing.<ref name=913AGref /> \n\nThe 512th moved to [[Wilmington Airport (Delaware)|New Castle County Airport]], Del. in April 1950, leaving the 327th behind at Reading. By August 1951, the 916th Air Force Reserve Training Wing was activated at Reading Municipal Airport to fill the empty support role left by the 512th.<ref name=913AGref /> \n\nThe start of the Cold War saw tensions rise in Korea and March 15, 1951 the 512th activated to support the military actions in the Korean conflict. Shortly thereafter, the 512th was inactivated at New Castle.<ref name=913AGref />   \n\n===Need for reserve troop carrier groups===\nDuring the first half of 1955, the Air Force began detaching Air Force Reserve squadrons from their parent wing locations to separate sites. The concept offered several advantages.  Communities were more likely to accept the smaller [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] than the large [[wing (military aviation unit)|wings]] and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning.  [[Continental Air Command]] (ConAC)'s plan called for placing Air Force Reserve units at fifty-nine installations located throughout the United States.  When these relocations were completed in 1959, reserve wing headquarters and wing support elements would typically be on one base, along with one (or in some cases two) of the wing's flying squadrons, while the remaining flying squadrons were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 156, 169</ref>\n\nAlthough this dispersal was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.  This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing [[group (military aviation unit)|groups]] with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons.  This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the [[Cuban missile crisis]], with the units being released on 22 November 1962.  The formation of troop carrier groups occurred in January 1963 for units that had not been mobilized, but was delayed until February for those that had been.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Activation of 913th Troop Carrier Group===\nAs a result, the '''913th Troop Carrier Group''' was established at [[Willow Grove Naval Air Station]], Pennsylvania on 11 February 1963,<ref name=913AWfacts/> as the headquarters for the [[327th Troop Carrier Squadron]], which had been stationed there since July 1958.<ref>Maurer, pp. 12\u201313</ref> Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 327th.\n\nThe group's mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems.   The group was equipped with [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s for [[Tactical Air Command]] airlift operations.\n\nThe 913th was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the [[512th Troop Carrier Wing]] in 1963, the others being the [[912th Troop Carrier Group]] also at Willow Grove, and the [[914th Troop Carrier Group]] at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station|Niagara Falls International Airport]], New York.\n\n===Redesignation as 913th Tactical Airlift Group===\n\nThe 913th was redesignated as the 913th Tactical Airlift Group (913 TAG) and performed air transportation for [[airborne forces]], [[airdrop]]s, {{not a typo|[[airlanding]]s}}, and extraction delivery of equipment and supplies, as well as airlift of personnel and cargo.  During the [[Vietnam War]] the group also helped train [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] C-119 aircrews in 1967 and ferried aircraft to Southeast Asia in March 1968 and to [[Taiwan]] in January 1969.\n\nIn 1970, the 913th transitioned from the C-119 to the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]].  Beginning in 1977 the 913th participated in rotational \"Coronet Oak\" [[Military operation|operations]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] flying airlift in support of [[U.S. Southern Command]] (USSOUTHCOM) at [[Howard AFB]].  In addition, it has performed [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] airlift and supported contingency operations worldwide, including operations in Southwest Asia and the [[Balkans]].\n\n===Redesignation as 913th Airlift Group and 913th Airlift Wing===\n\nWith the disestablishment of the 913th's active duty gaining command, the [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) in 1992, the 913th was redesignated as 913th Airlift Group (913 AG), with the [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).  From 1993 to 1997, the 913th's gaining command was temporarily changed to [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC), until a USAF reorganization returned the unit back to AMC.  In 1994, the 913 AG was redesignated as the 913th Airlift Wing (913 AW) as part of an Air Force-wide initiative to redesignate all Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard flying units with unit-assigned aircraft as wings.\n\nThe 913 AW was inactivated on 1 October 2007 under budget considerations.

The group replaced Detachment 1, [[Twenty-Second Air Force]], which had been established at Little Rock in March 2011.  The 913th Airlift Group is the first C-130 classic associate unit in the U.S. Air Force.  Upon activation, it was associated with the [[314th Airlift Wing]] of the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC) and the [[189th Airlift Wing]] (180 AW) of the [[Arkansas Air National Guard]] in performing the crew training mission for the C-130.

Shortly thereafter, the 512th was inactivated at New Castle.<ref name=913AGref />   \n\n===Need for reserve troop carrier groups===\nDuring the first half of 1955, the Air Force began detaching Air Force Reserve squadrons from their parent wing locations to separate sites. The concept offered several advantages.  Communities were more likely to accept the smaller [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] than the large [[wing (military aviation unit)|wings]] and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning.  [[Continental Air Command]] (ConAC)'s plan called for placing Air Force Reserve units at fifty-nine installations located throughout the United States.  When these relocations were completed in 1959, reserve wing headquarters and wing support elements would typically be on one base, along with one (or in some cases two) of the wing's flying squadrons, while the remaining flying squadrons were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 156, 169</ref>\n\nAlthough this dispersal was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.  This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing [[group (military aviation unit)|groups]] with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons.  This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the [[Cuban missile crisis]], with the units being released on 22 November 1962.  The formation of troop carrier groups occurred in January 1963 for units that had not been mobilized, but was delayed until February for those that had been.<ref>Cantwell, pp. 189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Activation of 913th Troop Carrier Group===\nAs a result, the '''913th Troop Carrier Group''' was established at [[Willow Grove Naval Air Station]], Pennsylvania on 11 February 1963,<ref name=913AWfacts/> as the headquarters for the [[327th Troop Carrier Squadron]], which had been stationed there since July 1958.<ref>Maurer, pp. 12\u201313</ref> Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 327th.\n\nThe group's mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems.   The group was equipped with [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s for [[Tactical Air Command]] airlift operations.\n\nThe 913th was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the [[512th Troop Carrier Wing]] in 1963, the others being the [[912th Troop Carrier Group]] also at Willow Grove, and the [[914th Troop Carrier Group]] at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station|Niagara Falls International Airport]], New York.\n\n===Redesignation as 913th Tactical Airlift Group===\n\nThe 913th was redesignated as the 913th Tactical Airlift Group (913 TAG) and performed air transportation for [[airborne forces]], [[airdrop]]s, {{not a typo|[[airlanding]]s}}, and extraction delivery of equipment and supplies, as well as airlift of personnel and cargo.  During the [[Vietnam War]] the group also helped train [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] C-119 aircrews in 1967 and ferried aircraft to Southeast Asia in March 1968 and to [[Taiwan]] in January 1969.\n\nIn 1970, the 913th transitioned from the C-119 to the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]].  Beginning in 1977 the 913th participated in rotational \"Coronet Oak\" [[Military operation|operations]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] flying airlift in support of [[U.S. Southern Command]] (USSOUTHCOM) at [[Howard AFB]].  In addition, it has performed [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] airlift and supported contingency operations worldwide, including operations in Southwest Asia and the [[Balkans]].\n\n===Redesignation as 913th Airlift Group and 913th Airlift Wing===\n\nWith the disestablishment of the 913th's active duty gaining command, the [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) in 1992, the 913th was redesignated as 913th Airlift Group (913 AG), with the [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).  From 1993 to 1997, the 913th's gaining command was temporarily changed to [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC), until a USAF reorganization returned the unit back to AMC.  In 1994, the 913 AG was redesignated as the 913th Airlift Wing (913 AW) as part of an Air Force-wide initiative to redesignate all Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard flying units with unit-assigned aircraft as wings.\n\nThe 913 AW was inactivated on 1 October 2007 pursuant to [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) 2005 action, with its Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft redistributed to other active duty Air Force and Air Force Reserve airlift units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afrc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/158600/hugs-teary-eyed-smiles-at-913th-aw-inactivation-ceremony/|accessdate=17 March 2020|title=Hugs, teary eyed smiles at 913th AW inactivation ceremony}}</ref>\n\n===Associate unit===\nThe unit was reactivated as the '''913th Airlift Group''' at [[Little Rock Air Force Base]], Arkansas and an activation ceremony was held on 13 July 2014.  The group replaced Detachment 1, [[Twenty-Second Air Force]], which had been established at Little Rock in March 2011.  The 913th Airlift Group is the first C-130 classic associate unit in the U.S. Air Force.  Upon activation, it was associated with the [[314th Airlift Wing]] of the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC) and the [[189th Airlift Wing]] (180 AW) of the [[Arkansas Air National Guard]] in performing the crew training mission for the C-130.  In October 2013, however, its predecessor had already begun transitioning to the combat airlift mission in association with the [[19th Airlift Wing]] (19 AW) of the [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/news/new-designation-for-lrafb-reserve-unit |title=New Designation for LRAFB Reserve Unit|publisher=Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.|date=7 July 2014|url-status=live |accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The 913th currently flies active duty Lockheed C-130J Hercules assigned to the 19th Operations Group, 19th Airlift Wing, at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas to accomplish all operational and training missions.<ref name=913AWfacts />\n\nLate February 2018, the unit returned home from a six-month [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] deployment to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.913ag.afrc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1453221/af-reservist-returns-home-from-afghanistan/|accessdate=17 March 2020|title=AF Reservist returns home from Afghanistan}}</ref>\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''913th Troop Carrier Group''', Medium and activated on 15 January 1963 (not organized)\n: Organized in the reserve on 11 February 1963\n: Redesignated '''913th Tactical Airlift Group''' on 1 July 1967\n: Redesignated '''913th Airlift Group''' on 1 February 1992\n: Redesignated '''913th Airlift Wing''' on 1 October 1994\n: Inactivated on 1 October 2007<ref name=913AWfacts/>\n* Redesignated '''913th Airlift Group'''\n: Activated c. 13 July 2014<ref name=913GroupActivated/>\n\n===Assignments===\n* Continental Air Command, 15 January 1963 (not organized)\n* [[512th Troop Carrier Wing]], 11 February 1963\n* [[302d Troop Carrier Wing]], 8 January 1965\n* [[514th Troop Carrier Wing]], (later 514th Tactical Airlift Wing, 514th Military Airlift Wing), 1 July 1966 (attached to 302d Special Operations Wing after 1 July 1970)\n* 302d Special Operations Wing, 16 September 1970 (attached to 403d Composite Wing after 1 April 1971)\n* [[403d Composite Wing]] (later 403d Tactical Airlift Wing), 21 April 1971\n* [[459th Tactical Airlift Wing]] (later 459th Airlift Wing), 8 January 1976\n* 403d Airlift Wing (later 403d Wing), 1 August 1992\n* [[Tenth Air Force]], 1 October 1994\n* [[Twenty-Second Air Force]], 1 April 1997 \u2013 1 October 2007<ref name=913AWfacts/>\n* Twenty-Second Air Force, c. 13 July 2014 \u2013 present\n\n===Components===\n: Groups\n* 913th Maintenance Group: 1 August 1992 \u2013 30 September 2007\n* 913th Operations Group: 1 August 1992 \u2013 30 September 2007\n* 913th Support Group (later 913th Mission Support Group): 1 August 1992 \u2013 30 September 2007\n\n;

The disease-causing bacteria ''Theileria taurotragi'' has caused many eland deaths. ''[[Clostridium chauvoei]]'', another bacterium, can be harmful as well. Eland are also hosts to several kinds of [[tick]]s. In one study an eland was found to be host to the ''[[Amblyomma]]'' species ''A. gemma'' and ''A. variegatum'', and ''[[Rhipicephalus]]'' species ''R. decoloratus'', ''R. appendiculatus'', ''R. evertsi'', ''[[Rhipicephalus pulchellus|R. pulchellus]]'' and ''R. pravus''. Elands produce [[antibody|antibodies]] for [[Brucella]] bacteria, but none for ''[[Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis|Mycobacterium paratuberculosis]]'' or various types of [[pneumonia]] like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.<ref name=Pappas/>\n\n==Interaction with humans==\n===Conservation===\n[[File:Taurotragus.oryx-01-Krakow.jpg|thumb|left|Common eland in a zoo in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]].]]\nCurrently, common elands are not endangered.

This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from [[cattle]] to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the [[coat of arms]] of [[Grootfontein]], [[Namibia]].\n\n===Husbandry===\nCommon elands have a mild [[temperament]] and have been successfully [[Domestication|domesticated]] for meat and milk production in [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]].<ref name=\"rafferty\"/> Their need for water is quite low because they produce [[urine]] with a high-[[urea]] content, but they require a substantial grazing area, along with [[Mineral lick|salt licks]] and large amounts of supplementary foods like [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[melon]]s and [[bean]]s which can be expensive. A female can produce up to {{convert|7|kg|lbs}} of milk per day that is richer in [[milkfat]] than cow milk. The pleasant-tasting milk has a [[butterfat]] content of 11-17% and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared, versus several days for cow milk.<ref name=Pappas/>\n\nHousing common elands is difficult due to their ability to jump over fences as high as {{convert|3|m}} or simply break through using their substantial mass. Sometimes, wild eland will break through enclosures to mix with domesticated ones. Common elands can reproduce in captivity, but calf survival is low and the young may need to be separated from their mothers to ensure health and adequate feeding.<ref name = Pappas/> [[Animal husbandry|Husbandry]] requires care because the generally placid animals startle easily and require large amounts of space.<ref name=Harris/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Africa|Mammals|Animals}}\n* Information at [https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=625126 ITIS]\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Taurotragus oryx|Common Eland}}\n* {{Commons-inline|Category:Taurotragus oryx|Common Eland}}\n{{Artiodactyla|R.4}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q216815}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:eland, common}}\n[[Category:Taurotragus|common eland]]\n[[Category:Fauna of East Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southern Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Burundi]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Botswana]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Angola]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Kenya]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Lesotho]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malawi]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Namibia]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Rwanda]]\n[[Category:Mammals of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals of South Sudan]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Eswatini]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Tanzania]]\n[[Category:Mammals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Uganda]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Animals in mythology]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1766|common eland]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Peter Simon Pallas]]\n[[Category:Bovids of Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Tom Radulovich", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHabitat and distribution:fix link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_eland"}
