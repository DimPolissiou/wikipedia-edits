One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke.

The university was moved from Mondov\u00ec, where it had retreated during the French occupation.

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy.

A diploma of Emperor Henry III of 1047 attributes them to Bishop Regimir in the mid-ninth century.<ref>Savio, p. 320. Semeria, pp. 406-407. Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor). In addition there were five officials called ''Trinitatis''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1021.</ref> The earliest known Provost was Walpert in 890.<ref>Bosio, p. 1775, who labels Walpert a 'diacono cardinale'.</ref> The earliest known Archdeacon was Ansprand, who signed a document in 863.<ref>Bosio, p. 1784.</ref> The earliest known Archpriest was Erchempert, ''Sanctae Taurinensis Ecclesiae Archipresbyter Cardinalis''.<ref>Bosio, p. 1800.</ref> The earliest known Primicerius (Cantor) was Adalwert, who signed a document in 890 ''Sancte Taurinensis Ecclesie Diaconus Cardinalis Cantor.''<ref>Bosio, p. 1805.</ref> The Provost and Primicerius subscribe a document of Bishop Milo in 1185.<ref>Chiuso, p. 435.</ref> The office of Treasurer was established by a bull of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] of 15 January 1472.<ref>Bosio, p. 1794.</ref> In 1690, there were twenty-nine Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 370 note 1.</ref> In 1744, there were six dignities and twenty Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 395 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Cathedral Chapter, there were seven Collegiate Churches in the diocese, which had Chapters of Canons. At Carmagnola there was a Chapter of an Archpriest and nine Canons. At Chieri, at S. Maria della Scala there were an Archpriest, a Cantor, and ten canons. In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].

On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83.

On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from the metropolitan obedience of Milan, and created Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism.

A diploma of Emperor Henry III of 1047 attributes them to Bishop Regimir in the mid-ninth century.<ref>Savio, p. 320. Semeria, pp. 406-407. Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor). In addition there were five officials called ''Trinitatis''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1021.</ref> The earliest known Provost was Walpert in 890.<ref>Bosio, p. 1775, who labels Walpert a 'diacono cardinale'.</ref> The earliest known Archdeacon was Ansprand, who signed a document in 863.<ref>Bosio, p. 1784.</ref> The earliest known Archpriest was Erchempert, ''Sanctae Taurinensis Ecclesiae Archipresbyter Cardinalis''.<ref>Bosio, p. 1800.</ref> The earliest known Primicerius (Cantor) was Adalwert, who signed a document in 890 ''Sancte Taurinensis Ecclesie Diaconus Cardinalis Cantor.''<ref>Bosio, p. 1805.</ref> The Provost and Primicerius subscribe a document of Bishop Milo in 1185.<ref>Chiuso, p. 435.</ref> The office of Treasurer was established by a bull of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] of 15 January 1472.<ref>Bosio, p. 1794.</ref> In 1690, there were twenty-nine Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 370 note 1.</ref> In 1744, there were six dignities and twenty Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 395 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Cathedral Chapter, there were seven Collegiate Churches in the diocese, which had Chapters of Canons. At Carmagnola there was a Chapter of an Archpriest and nine Canons. At Chieri, at S. Maria della Scala there were an Archpriest, a Cantor, and ten canons. In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].

The Browns defense held and Detroit was forced to settle for a 36-yard field goal by Doak Walker.<ref name=1954game />\n\nBilly Reynolds returned the subsequent kickoff 46 yards, crossing midfield to the Lions' 41 yard line. Cleveland was forced to punt but a roughing penalty gave the Browns new life and Graham hit Ray Renfro with a 35-yard pass for a touchdown. Following the Lou Groza conversion, the score stood at Cleveland 7, Detroit 3.<ref name=1954game />\n\nOn the next possession another Layne interception by defensive back Paul was run back 33 yards, setting up Cleveland in the red zone on the Detroit 8 yard line, with Graham hitting left end Darrell Brewster for the score. Following Groza's kick the score was Browns 14, Lions 3.<ref name=1954game />\n\n'''Second quarter'''\n\nDetroit was again stopped on their next possession and its punt was taken by Cleveland's Billy Reynolds and returned 46 yards to the Detroit 10 yard line. Grinding the ball to the 1 yard line, Graham ran a quarterback sneak and hit paydirt. Following the Groza conversion the score stood at Browns 21, Lions 3.<ref name=1954game />\n\nLion running back Lewis Carpenter tore up a 52-yard run in Detroit's next possession, setting up Detroit for its only touchdown of the day when fullback Bill Bowman scored from five yards out. Following the conversion by Lions kicker Doak Walker, it was Browns 21, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\nCleveland was forced to punt, but on the next Detroit possession defensive lineman McCormack ripped the ball from Layne, with the Browns recovering on the Detroit 31. Four plays later Graham ran for another touchdown, reaching the end zone standing up. With the conversion the score was Browns 28, Lions 10, and the route was on.<ref name=1954game />\n\nYet another Bobby Layne pass was intercepted by Cleveland's Michaels, who was listed as a substitute fullback and was thus probably playing the modern equivalent of the safety position. With the ball on the Lions' 31, Otto Graham launched a pass to halfback Ray Renfro, who made a great catch at the five yard line and took the ball over the score. With Groza's conversion, the halftime score was Browns 35, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\n'''Third quarter'''\n\nThe Browns opened the second half with a six play drive, highlighted by a 43-yard strike from Otto Graham to Darrell Brewster, who was stopped just short of the goal line. Graham scored his third touchdown of the day with a quarterback sneak, with Groza converting to make the score Browns 42, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\nKenny Konz grabbed the first of his two interceptions, running the ball back to the Detroit 13. Two plays later substitute fullback [[Fred \"Curly\" Morrison|Curly Morrison]] scored on a 12-yard run. Following the Groza extra point, the third quarter score stood at Browns 49, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n\nYet another pick by Konz set up the final touchdown of the day, when substitute halfback [[Chet Hanulak]] scored from the 10.

The Browns defense held and Detroit was forced to settle for a 36-yard field goal by Doak Walker.<ref name=1954game />\n\nBilly Reynolds returned the subsequent kickoff 46 yards, crossing midfield to the Lions' 41 yard line. Cleveland was forced to punt but a roughing penalty gave the Browns new life and Graham hit Ray Renfro with a 35-yard pass for a touchdown. Following the Lou Groza conversion, the score stood at Cleveland 7, Detroit 3.<ref name=1954game />\n\nOn the next possession another Layne interception by defensive back Paul was run back 33 yards, setting up Cleveland in the red zone on the Detroit 8 yard line, with Graham hitting left end Darrell Brewster for the score. Following Groza's kick the score was Browns 14, Lions 3.<ref name=1954game />\n\n'''Second quarter'''\n\nDetroit was again stopped on their next possession and its punt was taken by Cleveland's Billy Reynolds and returned 46 yards to the Detroit 10 yard line. Grinding the ball to the 1 yard line, Graham ran a quarterback sneak and hit paydirt. Following the Groza conversion the score stood at Browns 21, Lions 3.<ref name=1954game />\n\nLion running back Lewis Carpenter tore up a 52-yard run in Detroit's next possession, setting up Detroit for its only touchdown of the day when fullback Bill Bowman scored from five yards out. Following the conversion by Lions kicker Doak Walker, it was Browns 21, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\nCleveland was forced to punt, but on the next Detroit possession defensive lineman McCormack ripped the ball from Layne, with the Browns recovering on the Detroit 31. Four plays later Graham ran for another touchdown, reaching the end zone standing up. With the conversion the score was Browns 28, Lions 10, and the route was on.<ref name=1954game />\n\nYet another Bobby Layne pass was intercepted by Cleveland's Michaels, who was listed as a substitute fullback and was thus probably playing the modern equivalent of the safety position. With the ball on the Lions' 31, Otto Graham launched a pass to halfback Ray Renfro, who made a great catch at the five yard line and took the ball over the score. With Groza's conversion, the halftime score was Browns 35, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\n'''Third quarter'''\n\nThe Browns opened the second half with a six play drive, highlighted by a 43-yard strike from Otto Graham to Darrell Brewster, who was stopped just short of the goal line. Graham scored his third touchdown of the day with a quarterback sneak, with Groza converting to make the score Browns 42, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\nKenny Konz grabbed the first of his two interceptions, running the ball back to the Detroit 13. Two plays later substitute fullback [[Fred \"Curly\" Morrison|Curly Morrison]] scored on a 12-yard run. Following the Groza extra point, the third quarter score stood at Browns 49, Lions 10.<ref name=1954game />\n\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n\nYet another pick by Konz set up the final touchdown of the day, when substitute halfback [[Chet Hanulak]] scored from the 10.

Some [[intersex]] people also take this form of therapy, according to their personal needs and preferences.\n\nThe purpose of the therapy is to cause the development of the secondary sex characteristics of the desired [[sex]], such as [[breast]]s and a feminine pattern of [[body hair|hair]], [[fat distribution|fat]], and [[skeletal muscle|muscle]] distribution. It cannot undo many of the changes produced by naturally occurring [[puberty]], which may necessitate [[surgery]] and other treatments to reverse (see [[transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)#Unaffected characteristics|below]]). The medications used for the MTF therapy include [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulator]]s (GnRH modulators).\n\nWhile the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first [[puberty]], developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different gender can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with [[gender dysphoria]], and can help the person to \"pass\" or be seen as the gender they identify with. Introducing exogenous hormones into the body impacts it at every level and many patients report changes in energy levels, mood, appetite, etc. The goal of the therapy is to provide patients with a more satisfying body that is more congruent with their [[gender identity]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Medical uses==\n* To produce [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and/or [[wikt:demasculinization|demasculinization]] in transgender women and [[transfeminine]] [[non-binary]] individuals.\n* To produce feminization and/or demasculinization in intersex people.\n\n==Requirements==\n{{Main|Transgender hormone therapy#Requirements|Transgender hormone therapy#Accessibility}}\n\nMany physicians operate by the [[World Professional Association of Transgender Health]] (WPATH) [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SoC) model and require [[psychotherapy]] and a [[letter of recommendation]] from a [[psychotherapist]] in order for a transgender person to obtain hormone therapy.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Other physicians operate by an [[informed consent]] model and have no requirements for transgender hormone therapy aside from consent.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Medications used in transgender hormone therapy are also sold without a prescription on the [[Internet]] by unregulated [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]], and some transgender women purchase these medications and treat themselves using a [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) or [[self-medication]] approach.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\">{{cite web | last = Branstetter | first = Gillian | title = Sketchy Pharmacies Are Selling Hormones to Transgender People: Burdened by cost and medical discrimination, many people are taking a do-it-yourself approach to transitioning | website = [[The Atlantic]] | date = 31 August 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/diy-hormone-replacement-therapy/498044/}}</ref><ref name=\"Newman2016\">{{cite web | last1 = Newman | first1 = Rosalind | last2 = Jeory | first2 = Ted | title = Fears of 'DIY transitioning' as hormone drugs sold to transgender women without checks | website = [[The Independent]] | date = 16 November 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/female-hormone-drug-transgender-online-pharmacy-progynova-asset-chemist-gmc-cqc-a7403366.html}}</ref> Many transgender individuals discuss and share information on DIY hormone therapy on [[Reddit]] communities such as /r/TransDIY and /r/MtFHRT.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" /><ref name=\"Reddit-TransDIY\">{{cite web | title = r/TransDIY | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/}}</ref><ref name=\"Reddit-MtFHRT\">{{cite web | title = r/MtFHRT | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/MtFHRT/}}</ref> One reason that many transgender people turn to DIY hormone therapy is due to long waiting lists of up to years for standard physician-based hormone therapy in some parts of the world such as the [[United Kingdom]], as well as due to the often high costs of seeing a physician.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" />\n\nThe accessibility of transgender hormone therapy differs throughout the world and throughout individual countries.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" />\n\n==Contraindications==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome medical conditions may be a reason to not to take feminizing hormone therapy because of the harm it could cause to the individual.

Sex steroids have important functions in addition to their role in puberty, and some skeletal changes (such as increased height) that may be considered masculine are not hindered by GnRH modulators.\n\n====5\u03b1-Reductase inhibitors====\n{{See also|Finasteride#Transgender hormone therapy|Dutasteride#Transgender hormone therapy}}\n\n[[5\u03b1-Reductase inhibitor]]s are [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s of the [[enzyme]] [[5\u03b1-reductase]], and are a type of specific [[androgen synthesis inhibitor]].<ref name=\"pmid28472278\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Swerdloff RS, Dudley RE, Page ST, Wang C, Salameh WA | title = Dihydrotestosterone: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Clinical Implications of Elevated Blood Levels | journal = Endocr.

Transgender patients opting for [[breast reduction]] are rare. Shoulder width and the size of the rib cage also play a role in the perceivable size of the breasts; both are usually larger in transgender women, causing the breasts to appear proportionally smaller. Thus, when a transgender woman opts to have breast augmentation, the [[Breast implant|implant]]s used tend to be larger than those used by cisgender women.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nIn [[clinical trial]]s, cisgender women have used [[stem cell]]s from fat to regrow their breasts after [[Mastectomy|mastectomies]].

HRT causes the body to accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, and breasts. (Fat on the hips, thighs, and buttocks has a higher concentration of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and is meant to be used for [[lactation]].) The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nSubcutaneous fat increases in the [[cheek]]s and [[lip]]s, making the face appear rounder, with slightly less emphasis on the [[jaw]] as the lower portion of the cheeks fills in.\n\n====Muscle changes====\nHRT causes a reduction in [[muscle]] [[lean body mass|mass]] and distribution towards female proportions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====Bone/skeletal changes====\nMale-to-female hormone therapy causes the hips to rotate slightly forward because of changes in the [[tendon]]s. Hip discomfort is common.  This can cause a reduction in total body height.\n\nIf estrogen therapy is begun prior to pelvis ossification, which occurs around the age of 25, the pelvic outlet and inlet open slightly. The [[Femur|femora]] also widen, because they are connected to the pelvis. The pelvis retains some masculine characteristics, but the end result of HRT is wider hips than a cisgender man and closer to those of a cisgender woman.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Unaffected characteristics====\nHRT does not reverse bone changes that have already been established by puberty. Consequently, it does not affect height; the length of the arms, legs, hands, and feet; or the width of the [[shoulder]]s and [[rib cage]]. However, details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens, and HRT does prevent such changes from progressing further.\n\nThe width of the hips is not affected in individuals for whom [[Epiphysis|epiphyseal closure]] (fusion and closure of the ends of bones, which prevents any further lengthening) has taken place. This occurs in most people between 18 and 25 years of age. {{citation needed|reason=Supporting evidence for age range required |date=January 2016}} Already-established changes to the shape of the hips cannot be reversed by HRT whether epiphyseal closure has taken place or not.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEstablished changes to the bone structure of the face are also unaffected by HRT.

Some [[intersex]] people also take this form of therapy, according to their personal needs and preferences.\n\nThe purpose of the therapy is to cause the development of the secondary sex characteristics of the desired [[sex]], such as [[breast]]s and a feminine pattern of [[body hair|hair]], [[fat distribution|fat]], and [[skeletal muscle|muscle]] distribution. It cannot undo many of the changes produced by naturally occurring [[puberty]], which may necessitate [[surgery]] and other treatments to reverse (see [[transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)#Unaffected characteristics|below]]). The medications used for the MTF therapy include [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulator]]s (GnRH modulators).\n\nWhile the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first [[puberty]], developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different gender can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with [[gender dysphoria]], and can help the person to \"pass\" or be seen as the gender they identify with. Introducing exogenous hormones into the body impacts it at every level and many patients report changes in energy levels, mood, appetite, etc. The goal of the therapy is to provide patients with a more satisfying body that is more congruent with their [[gender identity]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Medical uses==\n* To produce [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and/or [[wikt:demasculinization|demasculinization]] in transgender women and [[transfeminine]] [[non-binary]] individuals.\n* To produce feminization and/or demasculinization in intersex people.\n\n==Requirements==\n{{Main|Transgender hormone therapy#Requirements|Transgender hormone therapy#Accessibility}}\n\nMany physicians operate by the [[World Professional Association of Transgender Health]] (WPATH) [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SoC) model and require [[psychotherapy]] and a [[letter of recommendation]] from a [[psychotherapist]] in order for a transgender person to obtain hormone therapy.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Other physicians operate by an [[informed consent]] model and have no requirements for transgender hormone therapy aside from consent.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" /> Medications used in transgender hormone therapy are also sold without a prescription on the [[Internet]] by unregulated [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]], and some transgender women purchase these medications and treat themselves using a [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) or [[self-medication]] approach.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\">{{cite web | last = Branstetter | first = Gillian | title = Sketchy Pharmacies Are Selling Hormones to Transgender People: Burdened by cost and medical discrimination, many people are taking a do-it-yourself approach to transitioning | website = [[The Atlantic]] | date = 31 August 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/diy-hormone-replacement-therapy/498044/}}</ref><ref name=\"Newman2016\">{{cite web | last1 = Newman | first1 = Rosalind | last2 = Jeory | first2 = Ted | title = Fears of 'DIY transitioning' as hormone drugs sold to transgender women without checks | website = [[The Independent]] | date = 16 November 2016 | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/female-hormone-drug-transgender-online-pharmacy-progynova-asset-chemist-gmc-cqc-a7403366.html}}</ref> Many transgender individuals discuss and share information on DIY hormone therapy on [[Reddit]] communities such as /r/TransDIY and /r/MtFHRT.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" /><ref name=\"Reddit-TransDIY\">{{cite web | title = r/TransDIY | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/}}</ref><ref name=\"Reddit-MtFHRT\">{{cite web | title = r/MtFHRT | website = [[Reddit]] | accessdate = 29 December 2018 | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/MtFHRT/}}</ref> One reason that many transgender people turn to DIY hormone therapy is due to long waiting lists of up to years for standard physician-based hormone therapy in some parts of the world such as the [[United Kingdom]], as well as due to the often high costs of seeing a physician.<ref name=\"Branstetter2016\" /><ref name=\"Newman2016\" />\n\nThe accessibility of transgender hormone therapy differs throughout the world and throughout individual countries.<ref name=\"ColemanBockting2012\" />\n\n==Contraindications==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome medical conditions may be a reason to not to take feminizing hormone therapy because of the harm it could cause to the individual.

The sixth edition of the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]]'s Standards of Care permit it from Tanner stage 2 but do not allow the addition of hormones until age 16, which could be five or more years later.

As a result, [[enzyme inducer|inducer]]s of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], [[rifampin]], [[rifampicin]], and [[St. John's wort]], among others, may decrease circulating levels of these medications and thereby decrease their effects. Conversely, [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[cimetidine]], [[clotrimazole]], [[grapefruit juice]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], and [[ritonavir]], among others, may increase circulating levels of these medications and thereby increase their effects. The concomitant use of a cytochrome P450 inducer or inhibitor with feminizing hormone therapy may necessitate medication dosage adjustments.\n\n==Effects==\nThe spectrum of effects of hormone therapy in transgender women depend on the specific medications and dosages used. In any case, the main effects of hormone therapy in transgender women are [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and [[demasculinization]], and are as follows:\n\n{{Effects of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women}}\n\n===Physical changes===\n\n====Breast development====\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Breast development in a transgender woman.png\n| width1 = 220\n| image2 = Breast development in a transgender woman 2.png\n| width2 = 220\n| footer = Breast development induced by hormone therapy in transgender women.\n<ref name=\"BaggishKarram2011\">{{cite book|author1=Michael S.

Development can take a couple years to nearly a decade for some. However, many transgender women report there is often a \"stall\" in breast growth during transition, or significant [[Breast#Asymmetry|breast asymmetry]]. Transgender women on HRT often experience less breast development than cisgender women (especially if started after young adulthood). For this reason, many seek [[breast augmentation]]. Transgender patients opting for [[breast reduction]] are rare. Shoulder width and the size of the rib cage also play a role in the perceivable size of the breasts; both are usually larger in transgender women, causing the breasts to appear proportionally smaller. Thus, when a transgender woman opts to have breast augmentation, the [[Breast implant|implant]]s used tend to be larger than those used by cisgender women.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nIn [[clinical trial]]s, cisgender women have used [[stem cell]]s from fat to regrow their breasts after [[Mastectomy|mastectomies]].

HRT causes the body to accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, and breasts. (Fat on the hips, thighs, and buttocks has a higher concentration of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and is meant to be used for [[lactation]].) The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.<ref name=\"Gooren1992\" />\n\nSubcutaneous fat increases in the [[cheek]]s and [[lip]]s, making the face appear rounder, with slightly less emphasis on the [[jaw]] as the lower portion of the cheeks fills in.\n\n====Muscle changes====\nHRT causes a reduction in [[muscle]] [[lean body mass|mass]] and distribution towards female proportions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====Bone/skeletal changes====\nMale-to-female hormone therapy causes the hips to rotate slightly forward because of changes in the [[tendon]]s. Hip discomfort is common.  This can cause a reduction in total body height.\n\nIf estrogen therapy is begun prior to pelvis ossification, which occurs around the age of 25, the pelvic outlet and inlet open slightly. The [[Femur|femora]] also widen, because they are connected to the pelvis. The pelvis retains some masculine characteristics, but the end result of HRT is wider hips than a cisgender man and closer to those of a cisgender woman.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Unaffected characteristics====\nHRT does not reverse bone changes that have already been established by puberty. Consequently, it does not affect height; the length of the arms, legs, hands, and feet; or the width of the [[shoulder]]s and [[rib cage]]. However, details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens, and HRT does prevent such changes from progressing further.\n\nThe width of the hips is not affected in individuals for whom [[Epiphysis|epiphyseal closure]] (fusion and closure of the ends of bones, which prevents any further lengthening) has taken place. This occurs in most people between 18 and 25 years of age. {{citation needed|reason=Supporting evidence for age range required |date=January 2016}} Already-established changes to the shape of the hips cannot be reversed by HRT whether epiphyseal closure has taken place or not.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEstablished changes to the bone structure of the face are also unaffected by HRT.

These changes may be reversed by surgery ([[facial feminization surgery]] and [[tracheal shave]], respectively).\n\nDuring puberty, the voice deepens in [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and becomes more [[vocal resonation|resonant]]. These changes are permanent and are not affected by HRT. [[Voice therapy (transgender)|Voice therapy]] and/or surgery may be used instead to achieve a more female-sounding voice.\n\nFacial hair develops during puberty and is only slightly affected by HRT. It may, however, be eliminated nearly permanently with [[laser hair removal]], or permanently with [[Electrology|electrolysis]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Mental changes===\nThe psychological effects of feminizing hormone therapy are harder to define than physical changes.

As the ice melted, [[Lake Stowe]] was formed. When the ice melted completely, the water from the lake ran out through the [[Lamoille River]] valley.\n\nThis area was long occupied by the Algonquian-speaking indigenous [[Abenaki]] people and their ancestors. During French colonization of what is now Canada, fur traders began to trade with the Abenaki. There were also French who settled here, coming down from the settlements in Quebec, and named the Lamoille River. The French later enlisted the Abenaki as allies in the frontier raiding and wars with English colonists in the lower New England colonies. For decades there was no border and peoples passed freely through this area.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and Vermont's admission as a separate state, the county was settled in the 19th century by American migrants from other parts of New England and French-Canadian immigrants from across the border. Some developed small farms. Some came to work in the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain, which operated into the 20th century. Some gradually moved to other counties where there were cotton mills, weaving cotton from the South both before and after the Civil War. In the United States, many of the French immigrants were forced to accept anglicization of their names, such as New City for Villeneuve, or Senton for St. Onge. Some of their descendants have reclaimed their family's original names.\n\n==20th century to present==\nMining continued through the 20th century. By the late 20th century, environmental hazards were better understood, but many of the miners contracted [[asbestosis]] and other diseases of the lungs from their work.\n\nIn 1972, the Lamoille Community College was the fifth of the several community colleges that became part of the Vermont State Colleges system.

As the ice melted, [[Lake Stowe]] was formed. When the ice melted completely, the water from the lake ran out through the [[Lamoille River]] valley.\n\nThis area was long occupied by the Algonquian-speaking indigenous [[Abenaki]] people and their ancestors. During French colonization of what is now Canada, fur traders began to trade with the Abenaki. There were also French who settled here, coming down from the settlements in Quebec, and named the Lamoille River. The French later enlisted the Abenaki as allies in the frontier raiding and wars with English colonists in the lower New England colonies. For decades there was no border and peoples passed freely through this area.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and Vermont's admission as a separate state, the county was settled in the 19th century by American migrants from other parts of New England and French-Canadian immigrants from across the border. Some developed small farms. Some came to work in the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain, which operated into the 20th century. Some gradually moved to other counties where there were cotton mills, weaving cotton from the South both before and after the Civil War. In the United States, many of the French immigrants were forced to accept anglicization of their names, such as New City for Villeneuve, or Senton for St. Onge. Some of their descendants have reclaimed their family's original names.\n\n==20th century to present==\nMining continued through the 20th century. By the late 20th century, environmental hazards were better understood, but many of the miners contracted [[asbestosis]] and other diseases of the lungs from their work.\n\nIn 1972, the Lamoille Community College was the fifth of the several community colleges that became part of the Vermont State Colleges system. At the time, they were renamed as Community College of Vermont.\n\nIn 2008, the state notified residents of Belvidere, Eden, Hyde Park, Johnson, Waterville and eight towns in the adjacent counties of Orleans and Franklin, that a review of health records from 1995 to 2006 had revealed that residents within {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} of the former asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain had higher than normal rates of contracting [[asbestosis]]. The state and federal government continued to study this problem.<ref>{{cite book| author = Rathke, Lisa |title = Neighbors worry about mine's impact on health | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = December 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009 the Vermont Department of health released a revised study which found that all of deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by individual occupational exposure. The report concluded that people living near the mines had no more increased risk of asbestos-related illness than people living anywhere else in Vermont.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthvermont.gov/health-environment/asbestos-lead-buildings/asbestos|title=Overview: Asbestos in Buildings|date=2016-07-18|work=Vermont Department of Health|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the county appeared to have disproportionate power in the legislature with the House Speaker, [[Shap Smith]], from Morrisville, [[Floyd Nease (politician)|Floyd Nease]], house majority leader, Senator [[Susan Bartlett]], from Hyde Park, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Richard Westman, chair of the House Transportation Committee and the sole Republican.<ref>{{cite book | author = Remsen, Nancy |title = Quartet hold power positions in 2009 Legislature | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = January 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|464|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|459|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_50.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> It is the second-smallest county in Vermont by area, as well as one of only two Vermont counties that does not share a border with another state or with Quebec.\n\nLamoille County is the only county in Vermont that does not have at least one of Vermont's five U.S. Routes passing through it, although all ten of the Lamoille County towns are served by Vermont state routes.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans County]] \u2014 northeast\n* [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] \u2014 east\n* [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]] \u2014 south\n* [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]] \u2014 west\n* [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]] \u2014 northwest\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 10475\n|1850= 10872\n|1860= 12311\n|1870= 12448\n|1880= 12684\n|1890= 12831\n|1900= 12289\n|1910= 12585\n|1920= 11858\n|1930= 10947\n|1940= 11028\n|1950= 11388\n|1960= 11027\n|1970= 13309\n|1980= 16767\n|1990= 19735\n|2000= 23233\n|2010= 24475\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=25300\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/vt190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|editor-last=Forstall|editor-first=Richard L.|date=March 27, 1995|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

It was marketed in the [[United Kingdom]] as the '''Vauxhall Royale Coup\u00e9''' by [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]].<ref>[http://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/reviews/vauxhall/royale/ Vauxhall Royale and Royale Coupe (1978 - 1984)], Honest John, 22 August 2013</ref>\n\n== Monza A1 (1978\u20131982) ==\n\nThe Monza was planned as a successor for the [[Opel Commodore|Commodore Coup\u00e9]]. In the late 70's the Commodore C model was made as a 2-door version (as was the Rekord E1), but still as a sedan type car. The first model of the Commodore the \"A\" series had a regular coup\u00e9 in the production line and Opel desired to make a newer version of their large luxury coup\u00e9. Work began in 1976 and in 1978 the first Monzas were available to buy. The cars to compete with would be the Mercedes W126 coup\u00e9 and the [[BMW]] 6 series C models (coupe models), and any other large luxury coupe. But what Opel hadn't realized was that the old ways were too old. The car was big without being hugely luxurious. This did not mean that the Monza was not comfortable. There was plenty of space inside the car, and the enormous seats left you with a feeling of sitting in a much more upmarket brand than Opel.\n[[File:1979 Opel Monza Automatic 3.0 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Opel Monza coupe rear (1978\u20131982)]]\n[[File:Vauxhall Royale coupe aka Monza A for UK market 2784cc registered April 1979.JPG|thumb|right|Vauxhall Royale coupe]]\n\nThe internals consisted of parts mainly borrowed from the Rekord E1 and later the E2, which meant cloth seats, and lots and lots of plastic on the dashboard and inner doors. Even the rev counter and the tachometer was taken directly from the Rekord E models, so that when you sat in one, the feeling was not that you drove a Monza, but more that you where driving a Rekord. If that wasn't enough trouble for Opel, they also experienced gearbox problems. The engine range for the Monza A1 was the 3.0S, the 2.8S, the newly developed 3.0E and later the 2.5E (the 3.0 had 180&nbsp;bhp and 248 Nm with fuel injection), gave a wide range. The 3-speed Borg Warner automatic transmission from the Commodore range needed to be modified to cope with the new and improved power outputs. Opel's own 4-speed manual gearboxes were not up to the job and, instead of putting in a more modern 5-speed manual gearbox, Opel turned to gearbox and transmission producer [[Getrag]], and installed the Getrag 264 4-speed manual gearbox in the early Monzas. But when people bought a big, luxurious coup\u00e9 they wanted modern products as well, and Opel obliged, as soon the Getrag 240 (for the 2.5  engines) and the Getrag 265 (for the 3.0E), both 5-speed manual gearboxes, replaced the old 4-speed gearbox.\n\nThe Monza, however, sharing the same layout as the Senator A1, had very good driving abilities. It handled quite well, thanks to the newly developed [[MacPherson strut]] system for the front of the car, as used on the Rekord E1 and E2, and the new (previously Opel had always used a non-independent rear axle on the Rekord E1 and E2, Manta, Ascona etc.) independent rear suspension gave the car soft, yet firm and capable, driving characteristics and excellent stability for such a big car. The engine range, however non-economical, was also very good, and few problems with the extremely reliable engines, even today, some 30 years later. The 6-cylinder engines were all of the CIH type (camshaft in head) and were in reality a 2.0-litre straight 4 with just 2 more cylinders. Many parts on the engine, such as the water pump and drive train, are in fact the same parts as used on the 4-cylinder version. This meant that this was an engine not only tested for many years in the Commodore, Admiral and Diplomat range, but also very reliable. Although the first generation of 3.0E engines in the Monza A1 had overheating problems when standing still, this could easily be fixed by fitting an oil-cooler.\n\nWhen Opel realized that the public disliked the Rekord interior, they introduced the \"C\" package. The \"C\" cars were fitted with extra instruments (oil pressure, voltmeter etc.) and the interior was either red, dark blue, green, or brown. As all parts of the interior were coloured, it seemed more luxurious than it did previously.\n\nThe A1 also came with a sports package or \"S\" package. The cars all where marked as \"S\" models on the front wings, and came with 15-inch Ronal alloy wheels and a 45% limited slip differential.\n\nHowever, being a coupe, it was rather large, and four well-sized adults had plenty of space. Even the boot was extremely large, and if that was not enough people had the possibility to flip down the rear seats to make even more space. The A1 was not a great hit at the customers even though it was fairly cheap to buy, the class of the car taken in consideration, and the fact that it actually got some good reviews by the press.\n\nWith the 3.0-litre engine, the Monza was at that time the fastest car Opel had ever built. Being capable of speeds as high as 215&nbsp;km/h, and the 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h mark went in just 8.5 seconds.\n\n== Monza A2 (1982\u20131986) ==\n[[File:OPEL-VAUX-MONZA-A-FACELIFT.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza (1982\u20131986)]]\n[[File:Opel monza h sst.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza rear (1982\u20131986)]]\nIn 1982, the Monza, [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] and [[Opel Senator|Senator]] all got a face-lift and were named the A2 (E2 for the Rekord). The A2 looked similar to the A1 overall but with some small changes to the front end. The headlights noticeably increased in size, and the front was more streamlined than the A1. The car was much more slippery, with drag resistance down by around ten percent (from 0.40 to 0.35 <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm x\\,</math>).<ref name=\"Mon813\">{{cite journal | ref= ED1 | journal=Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 107 | title= Essai detaill\u00e9: Opel Senator 2.2i| trans-title = Detailed Test | last= Pirotte | first= Marcel | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume=36 | number=813 | date=1985-01-24 | publisher=Editions Auto-Magazine }}</ref> Also the chrome parts like bumpers etc. were changed to a matt black finish, or with plastic parts. The bumpers were now made of plastic and gave the Monza the look of a sports car in appearance, and actually did look similar to the Opel Manta, despite the ample size difference. The rear lights were the same and the orange front indicators were now clear glass, giving a much more modern look to the car. Overall the update was regarded as successful although retrospectively some of the purity of the lines of the early car were lost.\n\nAt a time of rising fuel prices, the need for fuel efficiency was becoming paramount, and Opel decided to change the engine specifications of the Monza. This meant introducing both the inline four-cylinder CIH 2.0E engine from the Rekord E2 (replaced by the torquier 2.2 in October 1984).<ref name=\"Mon813\"/> However, as the Monza weighs almost 1400&nbsp;kg, given the 115&nbsp;PS of the two engines, the cars were underpowered and thus unpopular. The 2.5E was given a new Bosch injection system so between 136 and 140&nbsp;PS was available. The 2.8S was taken out of production. The 3.0E engine stayed the top of the range. The 3.0E was given an upgraded Bosch fuel injection and fuel consumption improved somewhat.\n\nThe cars now came with more luxurious interior, electrically controlled side mirrors and even an on-board computer, recording fuel consumption, speed and range.\n\n=== Monza GSE ===\n\n[[File:Opel Monza GSE vl white TCE.jpg|thumb|left|Opel Monza ''GSE'' (1983\u20131986)]]\n[[File:Keinath C5.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza convertible:<br>Keinath C5]]\nThe last incarnation of the Monza was the GSE edition in mid-1983;<ref name=\"Mon813\"/> basically the A2 car, but a high-specification model which had [[Recaro]] sports seats, digital [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] instruments, firmer suspension, the Getrag five-speed manual transmission, and an enhanced all-black interior. It also featured a large rear spoiler on the boot. Also GSE models are equipped with a 40% limited slip differential, an addition that had to be ordered separately on earlier 3.0E cars when purchasing.\n\nBy the time the Senator was updated to the new Senator B and the Monza cancelled, 43,812 Monzas had been built. There was no direct Monza replacement, although the idea of a large [[Opel]]/[[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] sporting car was carried on in the [[Lotus Carlton]]/Lotus Omega saloon. Bitter Cars put a 4.0 engine under the hood as a prototype. Three were built; two left hand drive and one right hand drive, one left hand drive burned out on a motorway in Germany and the other is in a museum, but the right hand drive one is in [[Somerset]], UK.\n\n==Holden Monza==\nIn [[Australia]], local racing legend [[Peter Brock]] had plans to import, modify and market the Opel Monza Coup\u00e9 as the Holden Monza with the [[Holden V8 engine|Holden 5 Litre]] [[V8 engine|V8]] fitted, through his own '''HDT''' ([[Holden Dealer Team]]) business, but the plans eventually fell through.<ref>[http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/news/1506/monaro-or-monza-holden-faces-a-coupe-conundrum/ Monaro or Monza?

It was marketed in the [[United Kingdom]] as the '''Vauxhall Royale Coup\u00e9''' by [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]].<ref>[http://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/reviews/vauxhall/royale/ Vauxhall Royale and Royale Coupe (1978 - 1984)], Honest John, 22 August 2013</ref>\n\n== Monza A1 (1978\u20131982) ==\n\nThe Monza was planned as a successor for the [[Opel Commodore|Commodore Coup\u00e9]]. In the late 70's the Commodore C model was made as a 2-door version (as was the Rekord E1), but still as a sedan type car. The first model of the Commodore the \"A\" series had a regular coup\u00e9 in the production line and Opel desired to make a newer version of their large luxury coup\u00e9. Work began in 1976 and in 1978 the first Monzas were available to buy. The cars to compete with would be the Mercedes W126 coup\u00e9 and the [[BMW]] 6 series C models (coupe models), and any other large luxury coupe. But what Opel hadn't realized was that the old ways were too old. The car was big without being hugely luxurious. This did not mean that the Monza was not comfortable. There was plenty of space inside the car, and the enormous seats left you with a feeling of sitting in a much more upmarket brand than Opel.\n[[File:1979 Opel Monza Automatic 3.0 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Opel Monza coupe rear (1978\u20131982)]]\n[[File:Vauxhall Royale coupe aka Monza A for UK market 2784cc registered April 1979.JPG|thumb|right|Vauxhall Royale coupe]]\n\nThe internals consisted of parts mainly borrowed from the Rekord E1 and later the E2, which meant cloth seats, and lots and lots of plastic on the dashboard and inner doors. Even the rev counter and the tachometer was taken directly from the Rekord E models, so that when you sat in one, the feeling was not that you drove a Monza, but more that you where driving a Rekord. If that wasn't enough trouble for Opel, they also experienced gearbox problems. The engine range for the Monza A1 was the 3.0S, the 2.8S, the newly developed 3.0E and later the 2.5E (the 3.0 had 180&nbsp;bhp and 248 Nm with fuel injection), gave a wide range. The 3-speed Borg Warner automatic transmission from the Commodore range needed to be modified to cope with the new and improved power outputs. Opel's own 4-speed manual gearboxes were not up to the job and, instead of putting in a more modern 5-speed manual gearbox, Opel turned to gearbox and transmission producer [[Getrag]], and installed the Getrag 264 4-speed manual gearbox in the early Monzas. But when people bought a big, luxurious coup\u00e9 they wanted modern products as well, and Opel obliged, as soon the Getrag 240 (for the 2.5  engines) and the Getrag 265 (for the 3.0E), both 5-speed manual gearboxes, replaced the old 4-speed gearbox.\n\nThe Monza, however, sharing the same layout as the Senator A1, had very good driving abilities. It handled quite well, thanks to the newly developed [[MacPherson strut]] system for the front of the car, as used on the Rekord E1 and E2, and the new (previously Opel had always used a non-independent rear axle on the Rekord E1 and E2, Manta, Ascona etc.) independent rear suspension gave the car soft, yet firm and capable, driving characteristics and excellent stability for such a big car. The engine range, however non-economical, was also very good, and few problems with the extremely reliable engines, even today, some 30 years later. The 6-cylinder engines were all of the CIH type (camshaft in head) and were in reality a 2.0-litre straight 4 with just 2 more cylinders. Many parts on the engine, such as the water pump and drive train, are in fact the same parts as used on the 4-cylinder version. This meant that this was an engine not only tested for many years in the Commodore, Admiral and Diplomat range, but also very reliable. Although the first generation of 3.0E engines in the Monza A1 had overheating problems when standing still, this could easily be fixed by fitting an oil-cooler.\n\nWhen Opel realized that the public disliked the Rekord interior, they introduced the \"C\" package. The \"C\" cars were fitted with extra instruments (oil pressure, voltmeter etc.) and the interior was either red, dark blue, green, or brown. As all parts of the interior were coloured, it seemed more luxurious than it did previously.\n\nThe A1 also came with a sports package or \"S\" package. The cars all where marked as \"S\" models on the front wings, and came with 15-inch Ronal alloy wheels and a 45% limited slip differential.\n\nHowever, being a coupe, it was rather large, and four well-sized adults had plenty of space. Even the boot was extremely large, and if that was not enough people had the possibility to flip down the rear seats to make even more space. The A1 was not a great hit at the customers even though it was fairly cheap to buy, the class of the car taken in consideration, and the fact that it actually got some good reviews by the press.\n\nWith the 3.0-litre engine, the Monza was at that time the fastest car Opel had ever built. Being capable of speeds as high as 215&nbsp;km/h, and the 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h mark went in just 8.5 seconds.\n\n== Monza A2 (1982\u20131986) ==\n[[File:OPEL-VAUX-MONZA-A-FACELIFT.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza (1982\u20131986)]]\n[[File:Opel monza h sst.jpg|thumb|right|Opel Monza rear (1982\u20131986)]]\nIn 1982, the Monza, [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] and [[Opel Senator|Senator]] all got a face-lift and were named the A2 (E2 for the Rekord). The A2 looked similar to the A1 overall but with some meagre changes to the front end. The headlights noticeably increased in size, and the front was more streamlined than that of the A1. The car was much more slippery, with drag resistance down by around ten percent (from 0.40 to 0.35 <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm x\\,</math>).<ref name=\"Mon813\">{{cite journal | ref= ED1 | journal=Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 107 | title= Essai detaill\u00e9: Opel Senator 2.2i| trans-title = Detailed Test | last= Pirotte | first= Marcel | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume=36 | number=813 | date=1985-01-24 | publisher=Editions Auto-Magazine }}</ref> Also the chrome parts like bumpers etc. were changed to a matt black finish, or with plastic parts.

For the same reason, the title \"corpse flower\" is also attributed to the genus ''[[Rafflesia]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' derives its name from [[Ancient Greek]] ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|amorphos}}, \"without form, misshapen\" + {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|phallos}}, \"[[phallus]]\", and ''[[Titan (mythology)|titan]]'', \"giant\").\nThe popular name \"titan arum\" was coined by W.H. Hodge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ahsgardening.org/uploads/pdfs/1962-01r.pdf|title=A Titan Arum Flowers|last=Hodge|first=W.H.|date=1962|website=ahsgardening.org|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische mannen poseren bij twee verschillende soorten Amorphophallus planten waaronder een in bloei staande Amorphophallus Titanum TMnr 60042790.jpg|thumb|left|Two titan arum in Sumatra, Indonesia (ca. 1900\u201340); one in leaf, which can reach up to {{Convert|6|m}} tall, and one in bloom]]\n\nThe titan arum's [[inflorescence]] can reach over {{convert|3|m|4=0}} in height. Like the related [[arum maculatum|cuckoo pint]] and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lily]], it consists of a fragrant [[spadix (botany)|spadix]] of flowers wrapped by a [[spathe]], which looks like a large petal. In the case of the titan arum, the spathe is a deep green on the outside and dark burgundy red on the inside, with a deeply furrowed texture. The spadix is hollow and resembles a large [[baguette]]. Near the bottom of the spadix, hidden from view inside the sheath of the spathe, the spadix bears two rings of small flowers. The upper ring bears the male flowers, the lower ring is spangled with bright red-orange [[carpel]]s. The \"fragrance\" of the titan arum resembles rotting meat, attracting [[carrion]]-eating [[beetle]]s and flesh flies (family [[Sarcophagidae]]) that [[pollination|pollinate]] it. The inflorescence's deep red color and texture contribute to the illusion that the spathe is a piece of meat. During bloom, the tip of the spadix is approximately human body temperature, which helps the perfume volatilize; this heat is also believed to assist in the illusion that attracts carcass-eating insects.\n\nBoth male and female flowers grow in the same [[inflorescence]]. The female flowers open first, then a day or two following, the male flowers open. This usually prevents the flower from [[self-pollination|self-pollinating]].\n\nAfter the flower dies back, a single leaf, which reaches the size of a small tree, grows from the underground [[corm]]. The leaf grows on a somewhat green stalk that branches into three sections at the top, each containing many leaflets. The leaf structure can reach up to {{convert|6|m}} tall and {{convert|5|m}} across. Each year, the old leaf dies and a new one grows in its place. When the corm has stored enough energy, it becomes dormant for about four months. Then the process repeats.\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Corm 0136a.jpg|thumb|Small corm of ''A. titanum'', [[Muttart Conservatory]], Edmonton, Canada]]\nThe corm is the largest known, typically weighing around {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"UNCC\">{{cite web|url=https://gardens.uncc.edu/plant-and-gardening-information/titan-arum/|title=Titan Arum Blooming|year=2007|website= Events|publisher=UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> When a specimen at the Princess of Wales Conservatory, [[Kew Gardens]], was repotted after its dormant period, the weight was recorded as {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Kew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |title=About titan arum Amorphophallus titanum |year=2006 |website=Information sheetO10 |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142257/http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-15 }}</ref> In 2006, a corm in the Botanical Garden of Bonn, Germany was recorded at {{convert|117|kg|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"botgabn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/titan/titanevents.php|title=Titanenwurz \u2014 Bonner Bl\u00fctenst\u00e4nde|year=2013|accessdate=2013-06-23}}</ref> and an ''A. titanum'' grown in Gilford, New Hampshire by Dr. Louis Ricciardiello in 2010 weighed {{convert|305|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gilford Steamer (newspaper) July 1, 2010 pp. A1 & A9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/tallest-bloom/|title=Tallest bloom|publisher=}}</ref> However, the current record is held by a corm grown at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, weighing {{convert|153.9|kg|abbr=on}} after 7 years' growth from an initial corm the size of an orange.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/titan-arum/the-story-of-our-corm|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh \u2013 The story of our corm|last=McDonald|first=Charlotte|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2017-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' is native solely to western [[Sumatra]], and western [[Java]] where it grows in openings in rainforests on limestone hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |title=Amorphophallus titanum |author=University of Connecticut |date=14 Feb 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502024600/http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |archive-date=2012-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the plant is cultivated by [[botanical garden]]s and private collectors around the world.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe titan arum grows in the wild only in the [[equator]]ial [[rainforest]]s of [[Sumatra]], Indonesia. It was first scientifically described in 1878 by Italian [[botanist]] [[Odoardo Beccari]]. The plant flowers only infrequently in the wild and even more rarely when cultivated. It first flowered in cultivation at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], London, UK in 1889, with over one hundred cultivated blossoms since then. The first documented flowerings in the United States were at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1937 and 1939. This flowering also inspired the designation of the titan arum as the official flower of the [[Bronx]] in 1939, only to be replaced in 2000 by the [[day lily]]. The number of cultivated plants has increased in recent years, and it is not uncommon for there to be five or more flowering events in gardens around the world in a single year. Advanced pollination techniques mean that this plant is rarely cultivated by amateur gardeners. However In 2011, [[Roseville High School (Roseville, California)]] became the first high school in the world to successfully bring a titan arum to bloom.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rjuhsd.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=200&ModuleInstanceID=2483&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=14723&PageID=412 | title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/species/201811/fin-whale-mountain-gorilla-recovering-thanks-conservation-action-iucn-red-list|title=Fin Whale, Mountain Gorilla recovering thanks to conservation action \u2013 IUCN Red List|date=2018-11-14|website=IUCN|language=en|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Titanum Inside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The pollen area as seen from the inside (UC Davis, California)]]\n\nIn 2003, the tallest bloom in cultivation, some {{convert|2.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, was achieved at the Botanical Garden of the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany.

After its initial blooming, there can be considerable variation in blooming frequency. Some plants may not bloom again for another 7 to 10 years while others may bloom every two to three years.<ref>Eastern Illinois University's [http://www.eiu.edu/grnhouse/titan_arum.php Three Titan Arum Blooms] 2012 Retrieved 2013-08-11</ref> There have also been documented cases of back-to-back blooms occurring within a year<ref>'Big Bucky' 5/2009 and 6/2009, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison</ref> and corms simultaneously sending up both a leaf (or two) and an inflorescence.<ref>'Big Bucky' 5/2012 and 'Little Stinker' 9/2009, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison</ref> There has also been an occasion when a corm produced multiple simultaneous blooms.<ref>University of Bonn Botanic Garden, Bonn, Germany [http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/docs/sibbaldia5.pdf Three blooms from one corm] Retrieved 2013-08-11</ref>\n\nThe [[spathe]] generally begins to open between mid-afternoon<ref>Eastern Illinois University's [http://www.eiu.edu/grnhouse/titan_arum.php Three Titan Arum blooms] 2012.

Although most spathes begin to wilt within twelve hours, some have been known to remain open for 24 to 48 hours. As the spathe wilts, the female flowers lose receptivity to pollination.\n\nSelf-pollination is normally considered impossible, but in 1999, Huntington Botanical Garden botanists hand-pollinated their plant with its own pollen from ground-up male flowers. The procedure was successful, resulting in fruit and ten fertile seeds from which several seedlings eventually were produced.<ref>Huntington Botanical Gardens, California [http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 Self-pollination] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810221200/http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 |date=August 10, 2013 }}.

The talipot palm, ''[[Corypha umbraculifera]]'', has a larger inflorescence, but it is branched rather than unbranched. ''A. titanum'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Sumatra]].\n\nDue to its odor, like that of a rotting corpse, the titan arum is characterized as a [[carrion flower]], and is also known as the '''corpse flower''' or '''corpse plant''' ({{lang-id|bunga bangkai}}\u2014''bunga'' means flower, while ''bangkai'' can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion). For the same reason, the title \"corpse flower\" is also attributed to the genus ''[[Rafflesia]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' derives its name from [[Ancient Greek]] ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|amorphos}}, \"without form, misshapen\" + {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}} \u2013 {{transl|grc|phallos}}, \"[[phallus]]\", and ''[[Titan (mythology)|titan]]'', \"giant\").\nThe popular name \"titan arum\" was coined by W.H. Hodge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ahsgardening.org/uploads/pdfs/1962-01r.pdf|title=A Titan Arum Flowers|last=Hodge|first=W.H.|date=1962|website=ahsgardening.org|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische mannen poseren bij twee verschillende soorten Amorphophallus planten waaronder een in bloei staande Amorphophallus Titanum TMnr 60042790.jpg|thumb|left|Two titan arum in Sumatra, Indonesia (ca. 1900\u201340); one in leaf, which can reach up to {{Convert|6|m}} tall, and one in bloom]]\n\nThe titan arum's [[inflorescence]] can reach over {{convert|3|m|4=0}} in height. Like the related [[arum maculatum|cuckoo pint]] and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lily]], it consists of a fragrant [[spadix (botany)|spadix]] of flowers wrapped by a [[spathe]], which looks like a large petal. In the case of the titan arum, the spathe is a deep green on the outside and dark burgundy red on the inside, with a deeply furrowed texture. The spadix is hollow and resembles a large [[baguette]]. Near the bottom of the spadix, hidden from view inside the sheath of the spathe, the spadix bears two rings of small flowers. The upper ring bears the male flowers, the lower ring is spangled with bright red-orange [[carpel]]s. The \"fragrance\" of the titan arum resembles rotting meat, attracting [[carrion]]-eating [[beetle]]s and flesh flies (family [[Sarcophagidae]]) that [[pollination|pollinate]] it. The inflorescence's deep red color and texture contribute to the illusion that the spathe is a piece of meat. During bloom, the tip of the spadix is approximately human body temperature, which helps the perfume volatilize; this heat is also believed to assist in the illusion that attracts carcass-eating insects.\n\nBoth male and female flowers grow in the same [[inflorescence]]. The female flowers open first, then a day or two following, the male flowers open. This usually prevents the flower from [[self-pollination|self-pollinating]].\n\nAfter the flower dies back, a single leaf, which reaches the size of a small tree, grows from the underground [[corm]]. The leaf grows on a somewhat green stalk that branches into three sections at the top, each containing many leaflets. The leaf structure can reach up to {{convert|6|m}} tall and {{convert|5|m}} across. Each year, the old leaf dies and a new one grows in its place. When the corm has stored enough energy, it becomes dormant for about four months. Then the process repeats.\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Corm 0136a.jpg|thumb|Small corm of ''A. titanum'', [[Muttart Conservatory]], Edmonton, Canada]]\nThe corm is the largest known, typically weighing around {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"UNCC\">{{cite web|url=https://gardens.uncc.edu/plant-and-gardening-information/titan-arum/|title=Titan Arum Blooming|year=2007|website= Events|publisher=UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> When a specimen at the Princess of Wales Conservatory, [[Kew Gardens]], was repotted after its dormant period, the weight was recorded as {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Kew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |title=About titan arum Amorphophallus titanum |year=2006 |website=Information sheetO10 |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142257/http://www.kew.org/ksheets/pdfs/o10titanarum.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-15 }}</ref> In 2006, a corm in the Botanical Garden of Bonn, Germany was recorded at {{convert|117|kg|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"botgabn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/titan/titanevents.php|title=Titanenwurz \u2014 Bonner Bl\u00fctenst\u00e4nde|year=2013|accessdate=2013-06-23}}</ref> and an ''A. titanum'' grown in Gilford, New Hampshire by Dr. Louis Ricciardiello in 2010 weighed {{convert|305|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gilford Steamer (newspaper) July 1, 2010 pp. A1 & A9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/tallest-bloom/|title=Tallest bloom|publisher=}}</ref> However, the current record is held by a corm grown at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, weighing {{convert|153.9|kg|abbr=on}} after 7 years' growth from an initial corm the size of an orange.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/the-gardens/edinburgh/titan-arum/the-story-of-our-corm|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh \u2013 The story of our corm|last=McDonald|first=Charlotte|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2017-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Amorphophallus titanum'' is native solely to western [[Sumatra]], and western [[Java]] where it grows in openings in rainforests on limestone hills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |title=Amorphophallus titanum |author=University of Connecticut |date=14 Feb 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502024600/http://titanarum.uconn.edu/199500115.html |archive-date=2012-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the plant is cultivated by [[botanical garden]]s and private collectors around the world.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe titan arum grows in the wild only in the [[equator]]ial [[rainforest]]s of [[Sumatra]], Indonesia. It was first scientifically described in 1878 by Italian [[botanist]] [[Odoardo Beccari]]. The plant flowers only infrequently in the wild and even more rarely when cultivated. It first flowered in cultivation at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], London, UK in 1889, with over one hundred cultivated blossoms since then. The first documented flowerings in the United States were at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1937 and 1939. This flowering also inspired the designation of the titan arum as the official flower of the [[Bronx]] in 1939, only to be replaced in 2000 by the [[day lily]]. The number of cultivated plants has increased in recent years, and it is not uncommon for there to be five or more flowering events in gardens around the world in a single year. Advanced pollination techniques mean that this plant is rarely cultivated by amateur gardeners. However In 2011, [[Roseville High School (Roseville, California)]] became the first high school in the world to successfully bring a titan arum to bloom.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rjuhsd.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=200&ModuleInstanceID=2483&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=14723&PageID=412 | title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/species/201811/fin-whale-mountain-gorilla-recovering-thanks-conservation-action-iucn-red-list|title=Fin Whale, Mountain Gorilla recovering thanks to conservation action \u2013 IUCN Red List|date=2018-11-14|website=IUCN|language=en|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Amorphophallus Titanum Inside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The pollen area as seen from the inside (UC Davis, California)]]\n\nIn 2003, the tallest bloom in cultivation, some {{convert|2.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, was achieved at the Botanical Garden of the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany.

After its initial blooming, there can be considerable variation in blooming frequency. Some plants may not bloom again for another 7 to 10 years while others may bloom every two to three years.<ref>Eastern Illinois University's [http://www.eiu.edu/grnhouse/titan_arum.php Three Titan Arum Blooms] 2012 Retrieved 2013-08-11</ref> There have also been documented cases of back-to-back blooms occurring within a year<ref>'Big Bucky' 5/2009 and 6/2009, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison</ref> and corms simultaneously sending up both a leaf (or two) and an inflorescence.<ref>'Big Bucky' 5/2012 and 'Little Stinker' 9/2009, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison</ref> There has also been an occasion when a corm produced multiple simultaneous blooms.<ref>University of Bonn Botanic Garden, Bonn, Germany [http://www.botgart.uni-bonn.de/o_samm/docs/sibbaldia5.pdf Three blooms from one corm] Retrieved 2013-08-11</ref>\n\nThe [[spathe]] generally begins to open between mid-afternoon<ref>Eastern Illinois University's [http://www.eiu.edu/grnhouse/titan_arum.php Three Titan Arum blooms] 2012.

Although most spathes begin to wilt within twelve hours, some have been known to remain open for 24 to 48 hours. As the spathe wilts, the female flowers lose receptivity to pollination.\n\nSelf-pollination is normally considered impossible, but in 1999, Huntington Botanical Garden botanists hand-pollinated their plant with its own pollen from ground-up male flowers. The procedure was successful, resulting in fruit and ten fertile seeds from which several seedlings eventually were produced.<ref>Huntington Botanical Gardens, California [http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 Self-pollination] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810221200/http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=4132 |date=August 10, 2013 }}.

Jock Ewing founded [[Ewing family (television)#Ewing Oil|Ewing Oil]] in 1930 and was the patriarch of the [[Ewing family (television)|Ewing family]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early life and career===\nJohn Ross \"Jock\" Ewing Sr. was born in 1909, the younger of two sons born to Leander Ewing and his wife. Through his older brother Jason, Jock got a job in an oil field in [[east Texas]]. While riding in a train [[boxcar]] he met [[Willard \"Digger\" Barnes]], and the two became friends. Jock, Digger, and Jason all became [[wildcatter]]s and began drilling their own fields. Digger had a unique ability to smell oil underground, and with Jock's business skills they began making a fortune.\n\nJason and Digger didn't get on much, while Jock stood up for Digger in those days. Jason eventually left [[Texas]] to wildcat in [[Alaska]], marrying a woman named Nancy Shaw, with whom he had a son Jack (played by [[Dack Rambo]]) and a daughter Jamie (played by [[Jenilee Harrison]]). Jock and Digger returned to Texas, where Jock met Digger's girlfriend, [[Miss Ellie Ewing|Ellie Southworth]]. In the long run, Digger's drinking and undependability made Miss Ellie see that Digger would never change, and that Digger was not the type of man to marry, and she left Digger for Jock. Digger started to wander across the country after Ellie left him, but Jock and Digger continued with their oil business ventures for a few more years. Even as late as 1939, Jock and Digger both signed a deal to share the profits of Ewing 23 between themselves and their heirs in perpetuity. However, when Ewing 6 came in, Jock put the field in his name only, to prevent Digger from gambling and drinking his half away. Digger was furious and he claimed that Jock had stolen the wells for himself, ending their friendship and business relationship.\n\n===Marriages and children===\nEllie Southworth was desperate to save Southfork, which was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but Jock was reluctant to marry, even after Miss Ellie chose him over Digger, because unbeknownst to Miss Ellie, Jock was previously married to a woman named Amanda Lewis and looked after her psychiatric needs. Amanda had suffered a mental breakdown shortly after she and Jock were married, and Jock put her in a mental hospital. The doctor told Jock that Amanda would never recover and advised Jock to divorce her, which he eventually did in 1930. In 1936, Jock and Miss Ellie married on the day that her family was to lose Southfork, and it was well known that Jock was the only man in Dallas with the money to save the ranch. Jock had a fragile and stormy relationship with Miss Ellie's father, Aaron Southworth, and with her brother Garrison; however, Barbara Southworth seemed to accept her new son-in-law, if only for Miss Ellie's sake. On his deathbed, Aaron accepted Jock as part of his family by giving him his favorite gun.\n\nJock and Miss Ellie had three sons together, [[J. R. Ewing|J.R.]], [[Gary Ewing|Gary]] and [[Bobby Ewing|Bobby]]. Jock served in [[World War II]], where he and an old army buddy, Tom Mallory, were shot down in a mission in [[Holland]]. They later returned to save the families who sheltered them. During his term in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Jock had an affair with an Army nurse from [[Emporia, Kansas]], named Margaret Hunter. Jock was shipped off to [[France]], and Margaret returned to the [[United States]]. She married her fianc\u00e9, Amos Krebbs, and soon thereafter gave birth to Jock's illegitimate son, [[Ray Krebbs]].\n\nAfter the war, Jock returned to Southfork and confessed to Miss Ellie about his affair with Margaret Hunter. She forgave him and they moved on. In 1948, Amos Krebbs left Margaret Hunter, leaving her to raise Ray as a single parent. In 1960, a 15-year-old Ray Krebbs showed up at Southfork with a note from his mother asking Jock to help Ray. Jock made Ray a hand on Southfork. Neither Jock, Miss Ellie nor Ray knew that Jock was Ray's father until 20 years later, when Amos Krebbs came to Dallas and revealed that Jock was Ray's father, bringing proof to back up his claim. Jock then welcomed Ray into the Ewing family, and personally explained it all to his family.\n\nAs the years passed from the 1930s onwards, Jock built Ewing Oil into one of the most powerful independent oil companies in Texas, much to the bitterness and jealousy of his former friend and business partner, Digger Barnes. Jock also became a successful rancher. Jock \"took over raising\" his eldest son J.R., showing him \"tough love\" and made him one of the most cunning and ruthless oil barons in the oil business. Jock came to heavily rely on J.R. in the management of Ewing Oil giving J.R. \"the fever for big business\" but \"never taught him when to stop\". Jock, for the most part, ignored his second son Gary, whom Jock considered weak and lacking the Ewing character, as Gary ran away from responsibility, began drinking excessively to handle the pressures of being a teenage husband and father, and couldn't stand up to J.R.'s bullying. Jock generally spoiled his youngest son, Bobby, who Jock considered to be \"the best of the lot\". Bobby had the morals that J.R. lacked and embraced Jock's favoritism. However, Bobby was often emotional, short-tempered and lacked the intelligence, drive, and focus to succeed in the oil business preferring football, women, ranching, and enjoying the social benefits of being a Ewing, which was earned by the hard work of Jock and J.R.\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1977, Jock retired as president of Ewing Oil. He made J.R. his successor and took a more active role in running Southfork with foreman Ray Krebbs.\n\n===Death===\nJock and Ellie briefly separated in 1981 after Miss Ellie learned that Jock was the power behind Takapa, a land development deal that she was fighting against on the grounds of conservationism.  After Ellie refused his order to back down and stay out of the matter, he left Southfork.  However, they quickly reconciled and went on a second honeymoon to [[Paris]]. Upon returning to the United States, Jock and Miss Ellie arrived in Washington. D.C., where they were met by the U.S. State Department with a request for Jock to lead the development of the oil industry in South America. Ellie returned to Southfork alone, while Jock had conferences in Washington. Jock briefly returned to Dallas for a few hours before leaving for South America. While flying back from [[Venezuela]] to [[Texas]], the helicopter he was in collided with a small plane and crashed into a lake. Jock's body was never found, but he was [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] in the fall of 1982. The storyline involving Jock's death was necessitated by the death of actor Jim Davis. A tribute to Davis was shown at the end of the episode \"The Search\"; a picture of Davis and the words \"Jim Davis 1909-1981\" was displayed for some moments as the final seconds of musical score played out before the final commercial break. A memorial headstone to Jock stands on Southfork Ranch, beside Miss Ellie's headstone and grave.\n\n==Wes Parmalee storyline==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\nIn a storyline during the 1986\u201387 season of the show, a man named Wes Parmalee (portrayed by [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]) came to Dallas, where Clayton and Ray hired him as ranch foreman on Southfork. One day, Miss Ellie found Jock's belt buckle, knife, letters, and photo of a young Miss Ellie in Parmalee's room. Wes then claimed to be Jock Ewing, and that he had survived the helicopter accident, which necessitated plastic surgery and rehab in a South American hospital. After passing a series of tests set by J.R. and Bobby, including [[X-ray]] tests, a [[polygraph]] test and knowledge about the Ewing family, including Jock's first wife Amanda and Ray being Jock's son, Wes convinced many in Dallas, in addition to Miss Ellie, Ray, and several other members of the Ewing family, that he could be Jock. However, Clayton, Bobby and J.R. utterly refused to believe any suggestion that Wes was Jock.\n\nBobby flew down and talked with the doctor who had treated Jock for a severe fever while he was in South America. Bobby returned to Southfork and revealed this information at a Ewing barbecue, where Jock's best friend Punk Anderson said that while he had the fever, Jock was telling the history of the Ewing family. This small piece of evidence against Wes Parmalee being Jock Ewing was seized upon. By then, Ray had told Wes that his presence was causing a lot of trouble to the family, just before Wes went to see Miss Ellie. Miss Ellie told her family that Wes had told her that he wasn't Jock.  However the scene where this supposedly happened was never filmed & occurred off screen. Additionally with hindsight the fact that his X-ray tests showed he had identical bone breakage scarring identical to Jock's X-rays would seem to support his claim that he was actually Jock. The Producer's left Wes's departure deliberately ambiguous \n\nThe storyline was an experiment to gauge an attempt to restore the late Jim Davis' character to the show, after efforts to recast proved futile after no suitable actor could initially be found to replace Davis. The intentions by the Producers was for Wes to actually be revealed as Jock.  Ultimately, viewer reaction was mixed, but not favorable, as Miss Ellie had found happiness with her remarriage to Clayton Farlow, and that actor Steve Forrest, then at 61, was 16 years younger than his predecessor.  Producers finally yielded to viewers and reneged on the original outcome of the storyline, leaving Jock supposedly dead for good by the end of the tenth season.  Since the tenth season was broadcast & with the ambiguous ending to Wes's departure, some fans have speculated that Wes may have been Jock but left to spare the family any more pain.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Ewingcar.jpg|right|thumb|Jock Ewing's Lincoln Mark V in a Southfork gift shop]]\nAfter Jim Davis' death, artist Ro Kim painted a portrait of the actor in his role as Jock Ewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosgallery.com/clients|title=Ro's Gallery: Clients - Celebrities|accessdate=July 15, 2006}}</ref> The portrait became a focal point of the ''Dallas'' set and was featured in a number of episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077000/trivia|title=Trivia for \"Dallas\"|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|accessdate=July 15, 2007|quote=After Jim Davis died, a portrait of him hung above the fireplace at Southfork as a memorial to the actor.

Jason eventually left [[Texas]] to wildcat in [[Alaska]], marrying a woman named Nancy Shaw, with whom he had a son Jack (played by [[Dack Rambo]]) and a daughter Jamie (played by [[Jenilee Harrison]]). Jock and Digger returned to Texas, where Jock met Digger's girlfriend, [[Miss Ellie Ewing|Ellie Southworth]]. In the long run, Digger's drinking and undependability made Miss Ellie see that Digger would never change, and that Digger was not the type of man to marry, and she left Digger for Jock. Digger started to wander across the country after Ellie left him, but Jock and Digger continued with their oil business ventures for a few more years. Even as late as 1939, Jock and Digger both signed a deal to share the profits of Ewing 23 between themselves and their heirs in perpetuity. However, when Ewing 6 came in, Jock put the field in his name only, to prevent Digger from gambling and drinking his half away. Digger was furious and he claimed that Jock had stolen the wells for himself, ending their friendship and business relationship.\n\n===Marriages and children===\nEllie Southworth was desperate to save Southfork, which was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but Jock was reluctant to marry, even after Miss Ellie chose him over Digger, because unbeknownst to Miss Ellie, Jock was previously married to a woman named Amanda Lewis and looked after her psychiatric needs. Amanda had suffered a mental breakdown shortly after she and Jock were married, and Jock put her in a mental hospital. The doctor told Jock that Amanda would never recover and advised Jock to divorce her, which he eventually did in 1930. In 1936, Jock and Miss Ellie married on the day that her family was to lose Southfork, and it was well known that Jock was the only man in Dallas with the money to save the ranch. Jock had a fragile and stormy relationship with Miss Ellie's father, Aaron Southworth, and with her brother Garrison; however, Barbara Southworth seemed to accept her new son-in-law, if only for Miss Ellie's sake. On his deathbed, Aaron accepted Jock as part of his family by giving him his favorite gun.\n\nJock and Miss Ellie had three sons together, [[J. R. Ewing|J.R.]], [[Gary Ewing|Gary]] and [[Bobby Ewing|Bobby]]. Jock served in [[World War II]], where he and an old army buddy, Tom Mallory, were shot down in a mission in [[Holland]]. They later returned to save the families who sheltered them. During his term in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Jock had an affair with an Army nurse from [[Emporia, Kansas]], named Margaret Hunter. Jock was shipped off to [[France]], and Margaret returned to the [[United States]]. She married her fianc\u00e9, Amos Krebbs, and soon thereafter gave birth to Jock's illegitimate son, [[Ray Krebbs]].\n\nAfter the war, Jock returned to Southfork and confessed to Miss Ellie about his affair with Margaret Hunter. She forgave him and they moved on. In 1948, Amos Krebbs left Margaret Hunter, leaving her to raise Ray as a single parent. In 1960, a 15-year-old Ray Krebbs showed up at Southfork with a note from his mother asking Jock to help Ray. Jock made Ray a hand on Southfork. Neither Jock, Miss Ellie nor Ray knew that Jock was Ray's father until 20 years later, when Amos Krebbs came to Dallas and revealed that Jock was Ray's father, bringing proof to back up his claim. Jock then welcomed Ray into the Ewing family, and personally explained it all to his family.\n\nAs the years passed from the 1930s onwards, Jock built Ewing Oil into one of the most powerful independent oil companies in Texas, much to the bitterness and jealousy of his former friend and business partner, Digger Barnes. Jock also became a successful rancher. Jock \"took over raising\" his eldest son J.R., showing him \"tough love\" and made him one of the most cunning and ruthless oil barons in the oil business. Jock came to heavily rely on J.R. in the management of Ewing Oil giving J.R. \"the fever for big business\" but \"never taught him when to stop\". Jock, for the most part, ignored his second son Gary, whom Jock considered weak and lacking the Ewing character, as Gary ran away from responsibility, began drinking excessively to handle the pressures of being a teenage husband and father, and couldn't stand up to J.R.'s bullying. Jock generally spoiled his youngest son, Bobby, who Jock considered to be \"the best of the lot\". Bobby had the morals that J.R. lacked and embraced Jock's favoritism. However, Bobby was often emotional, short-tempered and lacked the intelligence, drive, and focus to succeed in the oil business preferring football, women, ranching, and enjoying the social benefits of being a Ewing, which was earned by the hard work of Jock and J.R.\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1977, Jock retired as president of Ewing Oil. He made J.R. his successor and took a more active role in running Southfork with foreman Ray Krebbs.\n\n===Death===\nJock and Ellie briefly separated in 1981 after Miss Ellie learned that Jock was the power behind Takapa, a land development deal that she was fighting against on the grounds of conservationism.  After Ellie refused his order to back down and stay out of the matter, he left Southfork.  However, they quickly reconciled and went on a second honeymoon to [[Paris]]. Upon returning to the United States, Jock and Miss Ellie arrived in Washington. D.C., where they were met by the U.S. State Department with a request for Jock to lead the development of the oil industry in South America. Ellie returned to Southfork alone, while Jock had conferences in Washington. Jock briefly returned to Dallas for a few hours before leaving for South America. While flying back from [[Venezuela]] to [[Texas]], the helicopter he was in collided with a small plane and crashed into a lake. Jock's body was never found, but he was [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] in the fall of 1982. The storyline involving Jock's death was necessitated by the death of actor Jim Davis. A tribute to Davis was shown at the end of the episode \"The Search\"; a picture of Davis and the words \"Jim Davis 1909-1981\" was displayed for some moments as the final seconds of musical score played out before the final commercial break. A memorial headstone to Jock stands on Southfork Ranch, beside Miss Ellie's headstone and grave.\n\n==Wes Parmalee storyline==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\nIn a storyline during the 1986\u201387 season of the show, a man named Wes Parmalee (portrayed by [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]) came to Dallas, where Clayton and Ray hired him as ranch foreman on Southfork. One day, Miss Ellie found Jock's belt buckle, knife, letters, and photo of a young Miss Ellie in Parmalee's room. Wes then claimed to be Jock Ewing, and that he had survived the helicopter accident, which necessitated plastic surgery and rehab in a South American hospital. After passing a series of tests set by J.R. and Bobby, including [[X-ray]] tests, a [[polygraph]] test and knowledge about the Ewing family, including Jock's first wife Amanda and Ray being Jock's son, Wes convinced many in Dallas, in addition to Miss Ellie, Ray, and several other members of the Ewing family, that he could be Jock. However, Clayton, Bobby and J.R. utterly refused to believe any suggestion that Wes was Jock.\n\nBobby flew down and talked with the doctor who had treated Jock for a severe fever while he was in South America. Bobby returned to Southfork and revealed this information at a Ewing barbecue, where Jock's best friend Punk Anderson said that while he had the fever, Jock was telling the history of the Ewing family. This small piece of evidence against Wes Parmalee being Jock Ewing was seized on. By then, Ray had told Wes that his presence was causing a lot of trouble to the family, just before Wes went to see Miss Ellie. Miss Ellie told her family that Wes had told her that he wasn't Jock, that he had met Jock while working in South America and was on the helicopter with Jock, where he took Jock's things and learned about the Ewings. Wes wanted to have such a wonderful family again since he had lost his wife and children years ago. Miss Ellie claimed that Wes had apologized for the pain he'd caused, and had left Dallas for good.\n\nThe storyline was an experiment to gauge an attempt to restore the late Jim Davis' character to the show, after efforts to recast proved futile after no suitable actor could be found to replace Davis. Ultimately, viewer reaction was mixed, but not favorable, as Miss Ellie had found happiness with her remarriage to Clayton Farlow, and that actor Steve Forrest, then at 61, was 16 years younger than his predecessor.  Producers finally yielded to viewers and ended the storyline, leaving Jock dead for good by the end of the tenth season.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Ewingcar.jpg|right|thumb|Jock Ewing's Lincoln Mark V in a Southfork gift shop]]\nAfter Jim Davis' death, artist Ro Kim painted a portrait of the actor in his role as Jock Ewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosgallery.com/clients|title=Ro's Gallery: Clients - Celebrities|accessdate=July 15, 2006}}</ref> The portrait became a focal point of the ''Dallas'' set and was featured in a number of episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077000/trivia|title=Trivia for \"Dallas\"|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|accessdate=July 15, 2007|quote=After Jim Davis died, a portrait of him hung above the fireplace at Southfork as a memorial to the actor.
