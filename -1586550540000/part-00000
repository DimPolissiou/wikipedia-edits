Originally a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], Bergkamp was moved to main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and then to [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], where he remained throughout his playing career. Nicknamed the \"Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]\" by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters due to his [[fear of flying]], Bergkamp is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nThe son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in [[Amsterdam]] and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club [[Inter Milan]] in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]] trophies, and reach the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]], which marked his last appearance as a player.\n\nWith the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], where he impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which has been regarded as one of the greatest [[FIFA World Cup]] goals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bergkamp surpassed [[Faas Wilkes]]'s record to become the country's top goalscorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Robin van Persie]] and [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]].\n\nBergkamp has been described by [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] as having \"the finest technique\" of any Dutch international<ref name=\"Burgcamp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp|title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=28 April 2006|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> and a \"dream for a striker\" by teammate [[Thierry Henry]].<ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html|title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=22 July 2006|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London}}</ref> Bergkamp finished third twice in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100]] greatest living players.

Originally a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], Bergkamp was moved to main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and then to [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], where he remained throughout his playing career. Nicknamed the \"Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]\" by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters due to his [[fear of flying]], Bergkamp is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nThe son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in [[Amsterdam]] and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club [[Inter Milan]] in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]] trophies, and reach the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]], which marked his last appearance as a player.\n\nWith the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], where he impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which has been regarded as one of the greatest [[FIFA World Cup]] goals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bergkamp surpassed [[Faas Wilkes]]'s record to become the country's top goalscorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Robin van Persie]] and [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]].\n\nBergkamp has been described by [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] as having \"the finest technique\" of any Dutch international<ref name=\"Burgcamp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp|title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=28 April 2006|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> and a \"dream for a striker\" by teammate [[Thierry Henry]].<ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html|title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=22 July 2006|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London}}</ref> Bergkamp finished third twice in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100]] greatest living players.
