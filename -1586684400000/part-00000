The use of hyphens is called '''hyphenation'''.<ref>2009,</ref> ''Non-hyphenated'' is an example of a hyphenated word. The hyphen should not be confused with [[dash]]es ([[figure dash|\u2012]], [[en dash|\u2013]], [[em dash|\u2014]], [[Horizontal bar (punctuation)|\u2015]]), which are longer and have different uses, or with the [[minus sign]] ([[\u2212]]), which is also longer in some contexts.\n\nAs an [[Orthography|orthographic]] concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In terms of [[character encoding]] and display, that entity is represented by any of several [[character (computing)|characters]] and [[glyph]]s (including '''hard hyphens''', '''soft''' or '''optional hyphens''', and '''nonbreaking hyphens'''), depending on the context of use ([[#In computing|discussed below]]).\n\nAlthough hyphens are not to be confused with [[Dash#En dash|en dashes]] and minus signs, there are some overlaps in [[#Use in English|usage]] (in which either a hyphen or an en dash may be acceptable, depending on user preference; [[#En dash, hyphen, or either one|discussed below]]) and in character encoding (which often uses the same character, called a \"[[hyphen-minus]]\", to represent both the hyphen and the minus sign entities; [[#In computing|discussed below]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word is derived from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c6\u1fbd \u1f15\u03bd}} (''hyph' h\u00e9n''), contracted from {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03cc \u1f15\u03bd}} (''hyp\u00f3 h\u00e9n''), \"in one\" (literally \"under one\").<ref>{{LSJ|u%28fe%2Fn|\u1f51\u03c6\u03ad\u03bd|ref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|hyphen}}</ref> The word {{lang|grc|(\u1f21) \u1f51\u03c6\u03ad\u03bd}} ((''he'') ''hyph\u00e9n'') was used for a tie-like (\u203f) sign written below two consecutive letters to indicate that they belong to the same word when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity, before the ''space'' was in regular use.\n\n== Use in English ==\n\n{{Selfref|For Wikipedia's own standards for hyphen use, see {{slink|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Hyphens}}.}}\n{{original research section|date=January 2016|reason=Almost nothing in this section is tied to reliable sources, and there's a great deal of prescriptivist punditry about \"codification\" of various \"rules\".}}\n\nThe [[English language]] does not have definitive hyphenation rules,<ref name=\"Economist intro\">{{cite book |title=The Economist Style Guide |edition=11th |date=2015 |editor-first=Ann |editor-last=Wroe |location=London / New York |publisher=Profile Books / PublicAffairs |page=74 |quote='''hyphens'''&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no firm rule to help you decide which words are run together, hyphenated or left separate.}}</ref> though various [[style guide]]s provide detailed usage recommendations, and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise. Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts, or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or \"hanging\" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., ''nineteenth- and {{nowrap|twentieth-century}} writers''). Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.\n\nThe use of the hyphen in [[English compound]] nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' removed the hyphens from 16,000&nbsp;entries, such as ''fig-leaf'' (now ''fig leaf''), ''pot-belly'' (now ''pot belly'') and ''pigeon-hole'' (now ''pigeonhole'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7004661.stm |title=Small object of grammatical desire |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |date=20 September 2007}}.</ref> The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g. \"[[toolbar]]\", \"[[hyperlink]]\", \"[[pastebin]]\").\n\nDespite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of [[syllabification]] in [[typographic alignment#Justified|justified]] texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in [[column (typography)|columns]] with narrow measure, as when used with [[newspaper]]s).\n\n=== Separating ===\n==== Justification and line-wrapping ====\n\nWhen flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word in half so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables ([[syllabification]]), and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins ([[typographic alignment#Justified|justification]]) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of [[river (typography)|rivers]]. This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the [[column (typography)|column]] (called the measure in typography) is very narrow. For example:\n\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''Justified text<br />without hyphenation''\n|\n| ''Justified text<br />with hyphenation''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-family: monospace; text-align: justify\"|\nWe,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br />\nrepresentatives of the United<br />\nStates of America ...\n| style=width:3em;|&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| style=\"font-family: monospace; text-align: justify;\"|\nWe,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;the&nbsp;{{not a typo|represen-}}<br />\ntatives of&nbsp;the United States <br />\nof America ...\n|}\n\nThe details of doing this properly are complex and language-dependent, and can interact with other [[Orthography|orthographic]] and [[typesetting]] practices. [[Hyphenation algorithm]]s, when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts.\n\nIt may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word [[use\u2013mention distinction|being mentioned]] (as when used in a [[dictionary]]) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a [[critical edition]])\u2014not only to control its [[word wrap]] behavior (which [[character encoding|encoding]] handles with [[#Hard and soft hyphens|hard and soft hyphens]] having the same [[glyph]]) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph).

(The unhyphenated style is also called ''closed up'' or ''solid''.) A rule of thumb is that they are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen hurts clarity\u2014specifically, clarity at first glance rather than clarity upon a second look or a moment's pause. The clear\u2013unclear distinction involves some subjectivity, because what is instantly clear to one reader may not be to another (depending on, for example, subject matter familiarity). Nonetheless, consensus among users of a language often reduces that subjectivity for many words. This is explained further below.\n\nMany long-established words, such as ''disgusted'', ''degrade'', and ''refresh'', do not require a hyphen because they are fully fused to the point that their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as ''prewashed'' or ''repainted'', may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the [[syllable]]s, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.\n\nIn contrast, for some other words, the closed-up style may not be as clear, and the hyphen can ensure clarity and avoid awkwardness, including odd appearance or misguided parsing of syllables. An example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word ''{{nowrap |co-worker}}'' (versus ''coworker'') to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group ''cow'' (which might suggest ''[[cattle|cow]]'' ({{IPAc-en|k|a\u028a}}) before backtracking and reparsing occurred). In such cases, styling varies depending on individual preference, regional preference, occupational specialty, or [[style guide]] preference, because the definition of awkwardness for any given word depends on who is judging it.\n\nWords for which prefix hyphenation is least subjective, to the point that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that require a hyphen to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be [[homograph]]s, such as ''[[recreation]]'' (fun or sport) versus ''{{nowrap|re-creation}}'' (the act of creating again), ''retreat'' (turn back) versus ''{{nowrap|re-treat}}'' (give [[therapy]] again), and ''{{nowrap|un-ionized}}'' (not in [[ion]] form) versus ''unionized'' (organized into [[trade union]]s). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a [[proper noun|proper]] (capitalized) noun or adjective (''{{nowrap|un-American}}'', ''{{nowrap|de-Stalinisation}}'');<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.grammarmudge.cityslide.com/articles/article/426348/2805.htm | contribution = Hyphenated Words: A Guide | title = The Grammar Curmudgeon | publisher = City slide}}.</ref><ref name=\"Grammar book\">{{Citation | url = http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/hyphens.asp | title = Punctuation | publisher = Grammar book | contribution = Hyphens}}.</ref> (2) an [[acronym]] (''{{nowrap|anti-TNF antibody}}'', ''{{nowrap|non-SI units}}''); or (3) a number (''{{nowrap|pre-1949 diplomacy}}'', ''{{nowrap|pre-1492 cartography}}'').\n\nStyle guides codify rules to minimize inconsistency, the ultimate goal of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and inter-document consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the \"follow dictionary X\" rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary'' thus closes up ''preempt'', ''reexamine'', ''deemphasize'', ''nonnegotiable'', ''posttransfusion'', and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of \"awkwardness\" for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, ''reexamine'' and ''deemphasize'' are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to prefer the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the ''{{nowrap|co-worker}}''/''coworker'' example (mentioned earlier) or with ''antiinflammatory''/''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}'', many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas many others do not, and in such cases, dictionary styles vary (''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland's]]'', ''antiinflammatory''; ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary'', ''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}''). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus ''{{nowrap|shell-like}}'', not ''shelllike'').\n\nThere is a trend that words that once were hyphenated for clarity lose the hyphen as their familiarity grows. An excellent example is ''[[email]]''/''{{nowrap|e-mail}}''; the number of people who find ''email'' awkward dropped from the 1990s to the 2010s, and thus the hyphen has been dropped increasingly. For some instances, the consensus depends on occupational speciality or subspecialty. Although ''{{nowrap|[[proto-oncogene]]}}'' is still hyphenated by most users (and by both ''Dorland's'' and ''Merriam-Webster's Medical''), the solid styling (''protooncogene'') is gaining popularity, with oncologists and geneticists (for whom the term is most familiar) leading the way.\n\nA hyphen can clarify that two adjacent vowels\u2014whether two of the same letter (e.g., ''oo'', ''ee'') or two different letters (e.g., ''ae'', ''ei'')\u2014are pronounced separately rather than being merged in a [[diphthong]]. The question is how necessary the clarification is. Thus, hyphenated ''{{nowrap|de-escalate}}'' and ''{{nowrap|co-operation}}'' have plenty of support, consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous), although solid ''deescalate'' and ''cooperation'' have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous). Consensus for styling varies by class, subclass, and even by individual word, with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it. As classes, there are doubling (namely, ''aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, yy'') and nondoubling (for example, ''a+e, a+i, a+o; e+e, e+i, e+o''). Several subclasses exist. There are combinations that are not rare in English as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as ''ee'' and ''ei''); regarding ''de+e/re+e/pre+e'' and ''de+i/re+i/pre+i'', nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as ''reiterate'' and ''reinforce'') need no hyphen, but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as ''reexamine''/''{{nowrap|re-examine}}'' or ''deemphasize''/''{{nowrap|de-emphasize}}''). There are combinations that are rare in English as diphthongs (for example, ''aa'' and ''ii'') but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly; and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument; thus ''intraarterial'' and ''antiinflammatory'') or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs, which are \"odd-looking\" because rare (the hyphenation argument, thus ''{{nowrap|intra-arterial}}'' and ''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}'').\n\nA [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] can also sometimes be used, either to indicate nondiphthong status (e.g., ''co\u00f6peration'' and ''na\u00efve'') or to indicate non-silent terminal -e (e.g., ''[[Bront\u00eb family|Bront\u00eb]]''), but there are several implicit boundaries on this style's use; it is now rare (its peak of popularity was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and it was never applied extensively across the language (only a handful of examples, including ''co\u00f6peration'', ''na\u00efve'', and ''Bront\u00eb'', are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; for whatever reason, it never had any popularity in the ''de+e/re+e/pre+e'' or ''de+i/re+i/pre+i'' subclasses\u2014thus never ''*re\u00ebxamine'', ''*re\u00efterate'', ''*de\u00ebmphasize'', or others, although they might have been useful). Many users (and various dictionaries) consider the diaeresis optional in ''naive''/''na\u00efve'' (because not necessary for the reader to recognize the word), and ''*na-ive'' draws attention to itself as a style that is simply never used (although comprehensible). For ''deity'' and ''deify'', only solid styling (no hyphen or diaeresis) is normative.\n\n==== Syllabification and spelling ====\n\nHyphens are occasionally used to denote [[syllabification]], as in ''syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion''. Various British and North American dictionaries use an [[interpunct]], sometimes called a \"middle dot\" or \"hyphenation point\", for this purpose, as in ''syl\u00b7la\u00b7bi\u00b7fi\u00b7ca\u00b7tion''. This allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a hard hyphen is intended (for example, ''{{nowrap|self-con\u00b7scious}}'', ''{{nowrap|un\u00b7self-con\u00b7scious}}'', ''{{nowrap|long-stand\u00b7ing}}''). Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate a word is being or should be spelled. For example, ''W-O-R-D spells \"word\"''.\n\n=== Joining ===\n==== Compound modifiers ====\n\n{{further|Compound modifier|English compound#Hyphenated compound modifiers}}\n\n[[Compound modifier]]s are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an [[adverb]]\u2013[[adjective]] combination appears ''before'' a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in ''{{nowrap|American-football}} player'' or ''{{nowrap|little-celebrated}} paintings''. Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a \"player of American football\" or an \"American player of football\" and whether the writer means paintings that are \"little celebrated\" or \"celebrated paintings\" that are little.<ref>[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', p. 48. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}</ref> Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in ''{{nowrap|ice-cream-flavored}} candy'', and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (''{{nowrap|spine-tinglingly}} frightening''). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated. For example, some style guides prefer the construction ''high school students'', to ''{{nowrap|high-school}} students''.<ref>E.g. {{cite web |url= https://www.jhsph.edu/news/style_manual/h.html |title=H |work=Bloomberg School Style Manual |publisher=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"IU Style Guide\" /> Although the expression is technically ambiguous (\"students of a high school\"/\"school students who are high\"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun\u2013noun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: ''grade point average'' and ''department store manager''.<ref name=\"IU Style Guide\" />\n\nWhen a compound modifier ''follows'' the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, \"that gentleman is well respected\", not \"that gentleman is well-respected\"; or \"a patient-centered approach was used\" but \"the approach was patient centered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uhv.edu/ac/newsletters/writing/grammartip2004.11.30.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109235952/http://www.uhv.edu/ac/newsletters/writing/grammartip2004.11.30.htm |url-status = dead|archive-date=9 January 2010 |publisher=UHV |type=Grammar tip |date=2004-11-30 |title=Using Hyphens in Compound Adjectives (and Exceptions to the Rule) |first=John |last=Davis |accessdate=2010-01-05 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions. For example, \"A cost-effective method was used\" and \"The method was cost-effective\" (''cost-effective'' is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries). When one of the parts of the modifier is a [[proper noun]] or a [[proper adjective]], there is no hyphen (e.g., \"a South American actor\").<ref name=\"Hyphenated Compound Words\">{{cite web|url = http://englishplus.com/grammar/00000127.htm|title = Hyphenated Compound Words|accessdate = 2014-11-18|website = englishplus.com}}</ref>\n\nWhen the first modifier in a compound is an adverb ending in ''-ly'' (e.g., \"a poorly written novel\"), various style guides advise no hyphen.<ref name=\"Hyphenated Compound Words\" />{{additional citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, some do allow for this use. For example, ''[[The Economist]] Style Guide'' advises: \"Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions{{nbsp}}... Less common adverbs, including all those that end ''-ly'', are less likely to need hyphens.\"<ref name=\"Economist 12\">{{cite book |title=The Economist Style Guide |edition=11th |date=2015 |editor-first=Ann |editor-last=Wroe |location=London / New York |publisher=Profile Books / PublicAffairs |pages=77\u201378 |quote='''hyphens'''&nbsp;&nbsp; ... 12. Adverbs: Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions [examples elided]. But if the adverb is one of two words together being used adjectivally, a hyphen may be needed [examples elided]. The hyphen is especially likely to be needed if the adverb is short and common, such as ''ill'', ''little'', ''much'' and ''well''. Less common adverbs, including all those that end ''-ly'', are less likely to need hyphens [example elided].}}</ref>\nIn the 19th century, it was common to hyphenate adverb\u2013adjective modifiers with the adverb ending in ''-ly'' (e.g., \"a craftily-constructed chair\"). However, this has become rare. For example, ''wholly owned subsidiary'' and ''quickly moving vehicle'' are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: \"quickly\" cannot modify \"vehicle\".\n\nHowever, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide.<ref name=\"Grammar book\" /> For example, the phrase ''{{nowrap|more-important}} reasons'' (\"reasons that are more important\") is distinguished from ''more important reasons'' (\"additional important reasons\"), where ''more'' is an adjective. Similarly, ''{{nowrap|more-beautiful}} scenery'' (with a [[mass noun|mass-noun]]) is distinct from ''more beautiful scenery''. (In contrast, the hyphen in \"a {{nowrap|more-important}} reason\" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words\u2014such as ''well'', ''ill'', ''little'', and ''much''\u2014attract special attention in this category.<ref name=\"Economist 12\" /> The hyphen in \"well-[past_participled] noun\", such as in \"[[Cellular differentiation|well-differentiated cells]]\", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because ''early'' has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with ''advanced-stage disease'' and ''adult-onset disease'', like the parallelism of ''early-stage disease'' and ''early-onset disease''. Similarly, the hyphen in ''little-celebrated paintings'' clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings.\n\nHyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun),<ref name=\"AMA10section8.3.1\">{{cite book |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |section=8.3.1 |url=https://archive.org/details/amamanualofstyle0000unse }}</ref> although not in predicative position (after the modified noun). This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus ''{{nowrap|28-year-old}} woman'' and ''{{nowrap|twenty-eight-year-old}} woman'' or ''{{nowrap|32-foot}} wingspan'' and ''{{nowrap|thirty-two-foot}} wingspan'', but ''the woman is 28 years old'' and ''a wingspan of 32 feet''.{{efn|name=Plural nouns|With numbers greater than two, where a plural noun would normally be used in an unhyphenated predicative position, the singular form of the noun is generally used in the hyphenated form used attributively. Thus ''a woman who is 28 years old'' becomes ''a {{nowrap|28-year-old}} woman''. There are occasional exceptions to this general rule, for instance with fractions (''a two-thirds majority'') and irregular plurals (''a two-criteria review'', ''a two-teeth bridge'').}} However, with symbols for [[SI]] units (such as ''[[metre|m]]'' or ''[[kilogram|kg]]'')\u2014as opposed to the ''names'' of these units (such as ''[[metre]]'' or ''[[kilogram]]'')\u2014both the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] recommend use without a hyphen: ''a 25&nbsp;kg sphere''. When the units are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: ''a {{nowrap|25-kilogram}} sphere'', ''a roll of {{nowrap|35-millimeter}} film''.<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf \"The International System of Units (SI)\"], [[BIPM|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]], 2006</ref><ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf \"Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)\"], NIST Special Publication 811, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], March 2008</ref>\n\nIn spelled-out [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus ''{{nowrap|two-thirds}} majority''{{efn|name=Plural nouns}} and ''{{nowrap|one-eighth}} portion'' but ''I drank two thirds of the bottle'' or ''I kept three quarters of it for myself''.<ref name=\"APA6section4.13\">{{Citation |author=American Psychological Association (APA) |authorlink=American Psychological Association |year=2010 |title=The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association |edition=6th |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-4338-0562-2 |url=http://apastyle.org/ |postscript=.}}</ref> However, at least one major style guide<ref name=\"AMA10section8.3.1\" /> hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).\n\nIn English, {{Anchor|En dash, hyphen, or either one}} an [[en dash]] ( \u2013 ) sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, ''San Francisco\u2013area residents'', ''hormone receptor\u2013positive cells'', ''cell cycle\u2013related factors'', and ''public-school\u2013private-school rivalries'').<ref name=\"LutzStevenson2005\">{{cite book|author1=Gary Lutz|author2=Diane Stevenson|title=The Writer's Digest grammar desk reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsQ9ugnMcpUC&pg=PA296|year=2005|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-335-7|page=296}}</ref> A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (''hormone-receptor-positive cells'', ''cell-cycle-related factors''). (For other aspects of en dash\u2013versus\u2013hyphen use, see ''[[Dash#En dash|Dash > En dash]]''.)\n\n==== Object\u2013verbal-noun compounds ====\n\n{{anchor|Object\u2013verbal noun compounds||reason=Old section name; lots of redirs point here.}}\n\nWhen an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as ''[[Mixer (cooking)|egg-beater]]'' (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, ''egg-beater, egg beater,'' and ''eggbeater'' are all common.\n\nAn example of an ambiguous phrase appears in ''they stood near a group of alien lovers'', which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; ''they stood near a group of alien-lovers'' clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as \"alien\" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase ''a hungry pizza-lover'', the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as \"pizza\" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous.\n\nSimilarly, ''there's a man-eating shark in these waters'' is nearly the opposite of ''there's a man eating shark at table 6''; the first is a shark, and the second a man. ''A government-monitoring program'' is a program that monitors the government, whereas ''a government monitoring program'' is a government program that monitors something else.\n\n==== Personal names ====\n{{See also|Spanish naming customs#Hyphenation|Portuguese name#Hyphenation}}\n\nSome married couples compose a new [[surname]] (sometimes referred to as a [[double-barrelled name]]) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname.\n\nWith already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped. For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] and [[Sam Taylor-Johnson]]. Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] is a descendant of Louis Leml\u00e9 Dreyfus whose son was L\u00e9opold Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n==== Other compounds ====\n\nConnecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in ''lily-of-the-valley'', ''cock-a-hoop'', ''clever-clever'', ''tittle-tattle'' and ''orang-utan''. Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, ''orang-utan'' is also written as ''orangutan'' or ''orang utan'', and ''lily-of-the-valley'' may be hyphenated or not.\n\n==== Suspended hyphens ====\n<!-- Section header used as link target in redirects -->\n\nA '''suspended hyphen''' (also called a '''suspensive hyphen''' or '''hanging hyphen''', or less commonly a '''dangling''' or '''floating hyphen''') may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words that are connected by \"and\", \"or\", or \"to\". For example, ''nineteenth-century and twentieth-century'' may be written as ''nineteenth- and twentieth-century.'' This usage is now common and specifically recommended in some style guides.<ref name=\"IU Style Guide\">E.g. {{cite web |url= https://brand.iu.edu/messaging-strategy/editorial-style/style-guide/h.html |title=H |work=The IU editorial style guide |publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref> Suspended hyphens are also used, though less commonly, when the base word comes first, such as in \"investor-owned and {{nowrap|-operated}}\". Uses such as \"applied and sociolinguistics\" (instead of \"applied linguistics and sociolinguistics\") are frowned upon; the Indiana University style guide uses this example and says \"Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open\" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words).<ref name=\"IU Style Guide\" /> This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, ''{{nowrap|preoperative and postoperative}}'' becomes ''{{nowrap|pre- and postoperative}}'' (not ''{{nowrap|pre- and post-operative}}'') when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.<ref name=\"AMA10section8.3.1\" />\n\n=== Other uses ===\n\nA hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in dates (see below), telephone numbers or sports scores. It can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an [[en dash]] (see examples at {{mslink|Dash|En dash|Ranges of values}}).\n\nThe hyphen is sometimes used to hide letters in words ([[fillet (redaction)|filleting for redaction or censoring]]), as in [[G-d]], although an en dash can be used as well (\"G\u2013d\").\n\nThe hyphen is often used in [[Reduplication|reduplicatives]].\n\n== Varied meanings ==\n\nSome stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens to mark attributive phrases:\n* ''Disease-causing poor nutrition'' is poor nutrition that causes disease.\n* ''Disease causing poor nutrition'' is a disease that causes poor nutrition.\n* A ''hard-working man'' is a man who works hard.\n* A ''hard working man'' is a working man who is tough.\n* A ''man-eating shark'' is a shark that eats humans.\n* A ''man eating shark'' is a man who is eating shark meat.\n* ''Three-hundred-year-old trees'' are an indeterminate number of trees that are each 300 years old.\n* ''Three hundred-year-old trees'' are three trees that are each 100 years old.\n* ''Three hundred year-old trees'' are 300 trees that are each a year old.\n\n== Origin and history ==\n\nThe first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of [[Dionysius Thrax]]. At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low [[tie (typography)|tie mark]] between the two words.<ref name=\"nicky\">Nicolas, Nick. \"[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |date=6 August 2012 }}\". 2005.

Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines.<ref name=\"Houston2013\">{{cite book|author=Keith Houston|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA132|year= 2013|publisher=W.W.

Library of Congress]] shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing rigid frame. Gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His hyphen appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.\n\n== In computing ==\n=== Hyphen-minus ===\n\n{{Main|Hyphen-minus}}\n\nIn the [[ASCII]] [[character encoding]], the hyphen is encoded as character 45. This character is sometimes called the [[hyphen-minus]], as it is also used as the minus sign and even sometimes for [[dash]]es. In [[Unicode]], the hyphen-minus is encoded as {{U+|002D}} (-) so that Unicode remains compatible with ASCII. However, Unicode also encodes the hyphen and minus separately, as U+2010 (\u2010) and U+2212 (\u2212) respectively, along with the em dash U+2014 (\u2014), en dash U+2013 (\u2013) and other related characters. On Android, the Unicode hyphen and the hyphen-minus are similar but not identical (compare:\u2010-). The hyphen-minus is a general-purpose character that attempts to fulfill several roles, and wherever optimal typography is desired, the preferred hyphen, minus, or other symbol should be used instead. For example, compare 4+3\u22122=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus); in most fonts the hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character will not.\n\nHowever, the Unicode hyphen is awkward to enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus character remains very common. It is often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via [[dialog box]]es or multi-key, unmemorable [[keyboard shortcut]]s), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.\n\nThe ASCII hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying [[command-line option]]s. The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the [[getopt]] function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters (&nbsp;--&nbsp;) to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipelining]] in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized [[wikt:in lieu|in lieu]] of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a [[standard streams|standard stream]], instead of a file, is to be worked with.\n\n=== Hard and soft hyphens ===\n\n{{Further|Soft hyphen}}\n\nAlthough software ([[hyphenation algorithm]]s) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a [[soft hyphen]] (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is ''allowed'' but not ''forced''. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.\n\nIn contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a {{Anchor|hard hyphen}}'''hard hyphen''' (although some use this term to refer to a non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation ''may'' occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using [[hyphenation algorithm]]s are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.\n\n=== Nonbreaking hyphens ===\n<!-- Section header used as link target in redirects -->\n\nThe '''nonbreaking hyphen''', '''non-breaking hyphen''', or '''no-break hyphen''' looks identical to the regular hyphen, but word processors treat it as a letter, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what would be the end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The [[non-breaking space]] exists for similar reasons.\n\nThe [[word segmentation]] rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a [[word boundary (linguistics)|word boundary]] and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. However, this is not always desirable behavior, especially when it could lead to ambiguity (such as in the examples given before, where ''recreation'' and ''re\u2011creation'' would be indistinguishable), or in languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|an t\u2011athair}} or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|s\u2011a}} would be undesirable). {{Anchor|non-breaking hyphen}}In Unicode it is defined as {{unichar|2011|NON-BREAKING HYPHEN|html=}}.\n\n== Usage in date notation ==\n\n{{Further|Date and time representation by country}}\n\nIn parts of [[Europe]], the hyphen is used to delineate parts within a written date. Germans{{cn|date=February 2020}} and Slavs also used [[Roman numerals]] for the month; ''14\u2011VII\u20111789'' (14 July 1789), for example, is one way of writing the first [[Bastille Day]], though this usage is rapidly falling out of favour. Plaques on the wall of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] are written this way. Use of hyphens, as opposed to the slashes used in the [[English language]], is specified for international standards.\n\n[[International standard]] [[ISO 8601]], which was accepted as European Standard EN 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g., [[DIN]] 5008 in Germany), brought about a new standard using the hyphen. Now all official European governmental documents use this. These norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens: 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first Bastille Day. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.\n\nThis method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer filesystems make the use of slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \\ and / as directory separators, but / is also used to introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \\ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches.

The hyphen should not be confused with [[dash]]es ([[figure dash|\u2012]], [[en dash|\u2013]], [[em dash|\u2014]], [[Horizontal bar (punctuation)|\u2015]]), which are longer and have different uses, or with the [[minus sign]] ([[\u2212]]), which is also longer in some contexts.\n\nAs an [[Orthography|orthographic]] concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In terms of [[character encoding]] and display, that entity is represented by any of several [[character (computing)|characters]] and [[glyph]]s (including '''hard hyphens''', '''soft''' or '''optional hyphens''', and '''nonbreaking hyphens'''), depending on the context of use ([[#In computing|discussed below]]).\n\nAlthough hyphens are not to be confused with [[Dash#En dash|en dashes]] and minus signs, there are some overlaps in [[#Use in English|usage]] (in which either a hyphen or an en dash may be acceptable, depending on user preference; [[#En dash, hyphen, or either one|discussed below]]) and in character encoding (which often uses the same character, called a \"[[hyphen-minus]]\", to represent both the hyphen and the minus sign entities; [[#In computing|discussed below]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word is derived from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c6\u1fbd \u1f15\u03bd}} (''hyph' h\u00e9n''), contracted from {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03cc \u1f15\u03bd}} (''hyp\u00f3 h\u00e9n''), \"in one\" (literally \"under one\").<ref>{{LSJ|u%28fe%2Fn|\u1f51\u03c6\u03ad\u03bd|ref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|hyphen}}</ref> The word {{lang|grc|(\u1f21) \u1f51\u03c6\u03ad\u03bd}} ((''he'') ''hyph\u00e9n'') was used for a tie-like (\u203f) sign written below two consecutive letters to indicate that they belong to the same word when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity, before the ''space'' was in regular use.\n\n== Use in English ==\n\n{{Selfref|For Wikipedia's own standards for hyphen use, see {{slink|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Hyphens}}.}}\n{{original research section|date=January 2016|reason=Almost nothing in this section is tied to reliable sources, and there's a great deal of prescriptivist punditry about \"codification\" of various \"rules\".}}\n\nThe [[English language]] does not have definitive hyphenation rules,<ref name=\"Economist intro\">{{cite book |title=The Economist Style Guide |edition=11th |date=2015 |editor-first=Ann |editor-last=Wroe |location=London / New York |publisher=Profile Books / PublicAffairs |page=74 |quote='''hyphens'''&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no firm rule to help you decide which words are run together, hyphenated or left separate.}}</ref> though various [[style guide]]s provide detailed usage recommendations, and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise. Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts, or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or \"hanging\" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., ''nineteenth- and {{nowrap|twentieth-century}} writers''). Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.\n\nThe use of the hyphen in [[English compound]] nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' removed the hyphens from 16,000&nbsp;entries, such as ''fig-leaf'' (now ''fig leaf''), ''pot-belly'' (now ''pot belly'') and ''pigeon-hole'' (now ''pigeonhole'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7004661.stm |title=Small object of grammatical desire |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |date=20 September 2007}}.</ref> The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g. \"[[toolbar]]\", \"[[hyperlink]]\", \"[[pastebin]]\").\n\nDespite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of [[syllabification]] in [[typographic alignment#Justified|justified]] texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in [[column (typography)|columns]] with narrow measure, as when used with [[newspaper]]s).\n\n=== Separating ===\n==== Justification and line-wrapping ====\n\nWhen flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word in half so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables ([[syllabification]]), and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins ([[typographic alignment#Justified|justification]]) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of [[river (typography)|rivers]]. This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the [[column (typography)|column]] (called the measure in typography) is very narrow. For example:\n\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''Justified text<br />without hyphenation''\n|\n| ''Justified text<br />with hyphenation''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-family: monospace; text-align: justify\"|\nWe,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br />\nrepresentatives of the United<br />\nStates of America ...\n| style=width:3em;|&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| style=\"font-family: monospace; text-align: justify;\"|\nWe,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;the&nbsp;{{not a typo|represen-}}<br />\ntatives of&nbsp;the United States <br />\nof America ...\n|}\n\nThe details of doing this properly are complex and language-dependent, and can interact with other [[Orthography|orthographic]] and [[typesetting]] practices. [[Hyphenation algorithm]]s, when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts.\n\nIt may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word [[use\u2013mention distinction|being mentioned]] (as when used in a [[dictionary]]) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a [[critical edition]])\u2014not only to control its [[word wrap]] behavior (which [[character encoding|encoding]] handles with [[#Hard and soft hyphens|hard and soft hyphens]] having the same [[glyph]]) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph).

(The unhyphenated style is also called ''closed up'' or ''solid''.) A rule of thumb is that they are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen hurts clarity\u2014specifically, clarity at first glance rather than clarity upon a second look or a moment's pause. The clear\u2013unclear distinction involves some subjectivity, because what is instantly clear to one reader may not be to another (depending on, for example, subject matter familiarity). Nonetheless, consensus among users of a language often reduces that subjectivity for many words. This is explained further below.\n\nMany long-established words, such as ''disgusted'', ''degrade'', and ''refresh'', do not require a hyphen because they are fully fused to the point that their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as ''prewashed'' or ''repainted'', may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the [[syllable]]s, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.\n\nIn contrast, for some other words, the closed-up style may not be as clear, and the hyphen can ensure clarity and avoid awkwardness, including odd appearance or misguided parsing of syllables. An example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word ''{{nowrap |co-worker}}'' (versus ''coworker'') to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group ''cow'' (which might suggest ''[[cattle|cow]]'' ({{IPAc-en|k|a\u028a}}) before backtracking and reparsing occurred). In such cases, styling varies depending on individual preference, regional preference, occupational specialty, or [[style guide]] preference, because the definition of awkwardness for any given word depends on who is judging it.\n\nWords for which prefix hyphenation is least subjective, to the point that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that require a hyphen to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be [[homograph]]s, such as ''[[recreation]]'' (fun or sport) versus ''{{nowrap|re-creation}}'' (the act of creating again), ''retreat'' (turn back) versus ''{{nowrap|re-treat}}'' (give [[therapy]] again), and ''{{nowrap|un-ionized}}'' (not in [[ion]] form) versus ''unionized'' (organized into [[trade union]]s). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a [[proper noun|proper]] (capitalized) noun or adjective (''{{nowrap|un-American}}'', ''{{nowrap|de-Stalinisation}}'');<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.grammarmudge.cityslide.com/articles/article/426348/2805.htm | contribution = Hyphenated Words: A Guide | title = The Grammar Curmudgeon | publisher = City slide}}.</ref><ref name=\"Grammar book\">{{Citation | url = http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/hyphens.asp | title = Punctuation | publisher = Grammar book | contribution = Hyphens}}.</ref> (2) an [[acronym]] (''{{nowrap|anti-TNF antibody}}'', ''{{nowrap|non-SI units}}''); or (3) a number (''{{nowrap|pre-1949 diplomacy}}'', ''{{nowrap|pre-1492 cartography}}'').\n\nStyle guides codify rules to minimize inconsistency, the ultimate goal of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and inter-document consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the \"follow dictionary X\" rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary'' thus closes up ''preempt'', ''reexamine'', ''deemphasize'', ''nonnegotiable'', ''posttransfusion'', and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of \"awkwardness\" for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, ''reexamine'' and ''deemphasize'' are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to prefer the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the ''{{nowrap|co-worker}}''/''coworker'' example (mentioned earlier) or with ''antiinflammatory''/''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}'', many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas many others do not, and in such cases, dictionary styles vary (''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland's]]'', ''antiinflammatory''; ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary'', ''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}''). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus ''{{nowrap|shell-like}}'', not ''shelllike'').\n\nThere is a trend that words that once were hyphenated for clarity lose the hyphen as their familiarity grows. An excellent example is ''[[email]]''/''{{nowrap|e-mail}}''; the number of people who find ''email'' awkward dropped from the 1990s to the 2010s, and thus the hyphen has been dropped increasingly. For some instances, the consensus depends on occupational speciality or subspecialty. Although ''{{nowrap|[[proto-oncogene]]}}'' is still hyphenated by most users (and by both ''Dorland's'' and ''Merriam-Webster's Medical''), the solid styling (''protooncogene'') is gaining popularity, with oncologists and geneticists (for whom the term is most familiar) leading the way.\n\nA hyphen can clarify that two adjacent vowels\u2014whether two of the same letter (e.g., ''oo'', ''ee'') or two different letters (e.g., ''ae'', ''ei'')\u2014are pronounced separately rather than being merged in a [[diphthong]]. The question is how necessary the clarification is. Thus, hyphenated ''{{nowrap|de-escalate}}'' and ''{{nowrap|co-operation}}'' have plenty of support, consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous), although solid ''deescalate'' and ''cooperation'' have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous). Consensus for styling varies by class, subclass, and even by individual word, with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it. As classes, there are doubling (namely, ''aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, yy'') and nondoubling (for example, ''a+e, a+i, a+o; e+e, e+i, e+o''). Several subclasses exist. There are combinations that are not rare in English as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as ''ee'' and ''ei''); regarding ''de+e/re+e/pre+e'' and ''de+i/re+i/pre+i'', nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as ''reiterate'' and ''reinforce'') need no hyphen, but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as ''reexamine''/''{{nowrap|re-examine}}'' or ''deemphasize''/''{{nowrap|de-emphasize}}''). There are combinations that are rare in English as diphthongs (for example, ''aa'' and ''ii'') but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly; and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument; thus ''intraarterial'' and ''antiinflammatory'') or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs, which are \"odd-looking\" because rare (the hyphenation argument, thus ''{{nowrap|intra-arterial}}'' and ''{{nowrap|anti-inflammatory}}'').\n\nA [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] can also sometimes be used, either to indicate nondiphthong status (e.g., ''co\u00f6peration'' and ''na\u00efve'') or to indicate non-silent terminal -e (e.g., ''[[Bront\u00eb family|Bront\u00eb]]''), but there are several implicit boundaries on this style's use; it is now rare (its peak of popularity was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and it was never applied extensively across the language (only a handful of examples, including ''co\u00f6peration'', ''na\u00efve'', and ''Bront\u00eb'', are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; for whatever reason, it never had any popularity in the ''de+e/re+e/pre+e'' or ''de+i/re+i/pre+i'' subclasses\u2014thus never ''*re\u00ebxamine'', ''*re\u00efterate'', ''*de\u00ebmphasize'', or others, although they might have been useful). Many users (and various dictionaries) consider the diaeresis optional in ''naive''/''na\u00efve'' (because not necessary for the reader to recognize the word), and ''*na-ive'' draws attention to itself as a style that is simply never used (although comprehensible). For ''deity'' and ''deify'', only solid styling (no hyphen or diaeresis) is normative.\n\n==== Syllabification and spelling ====\n\nHyphens are occasionally used to denote [[syllabification]], as in ''syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion''. Various British and North American dictionaries use an [[interpunct]], sometimes called a \"middle dot\" or \"hyphenation point\", for this purpose, as in ''syl\u00b7la\u00b7bi\u00b7fi\u00b7ca\u00b7tion''. This allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a hard hyphen is intended (for example, ''{{nowrap|self-con\u00b7scious}}'', ''{{nowrap|un\u00b7self-con\u00b7scious}}'', ''{{nowrap|long-stand\u00b7ing}}''). Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate a word is being or should be spelled. For example, ''W-O-R-D spells \"word\"''.\n\n=== Joining ===\n==== Compound modifiers ====\n\n{{further|Compound modifier|English compound#Hyphenated compound modifiers}}\n\n[[Compound modifier]]s are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an [[adverb]]\u2013[[adjective]] combination appears ''before'' a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in ''{{nowrap|American-football}} player'' or ''{{nowrap|little-celebrated}} paintings''. Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a \"player of American football\" or an \"American player of football\" and whether the writer means paintings that are \"little celebrated\" or \"celebrated paintings\" that are little.<ref>[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', p. 48. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}</ref> Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in ''{{nowrap|ice-cream-flavored}} candy'', and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (''{{nowrap|spine-tinglingly}} frightening''). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated. For example, some style guides prefer the construction ''high school students'', to ''{{nowrap|high-school}} students''.<ref>E.g. {{cite web |url= https://www.jhsph.edu/news/style_manual/h.html |title=H |work=Bloomberg School Style Manual |publisher=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"IU Style Guide\" /> Although the expression is technically ambiguous (\"students of a high school\"/\"school students who are high\"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun\u2013noun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: ''grade point average'' and ''department store manager''.<ref name=\"IU Style Guide\" />\n\nWhen a compound modifier ''follows'' the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, \"that gentleman is well respected\", not \"that gentleman is well-respected\"; or \"a patient-centered approach was used\" but \"the approach was patient centered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uhv.edu/ac/newsletters/writing/grammartip2004.11.30.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109235952/http://www.uhv.edu/ac/newsletters/writing/grammartip2004.11.30.htm |url-status = dead|archive-date=9 January 2010 |publisher=UHV |type=Grammar tip |date=2004-11-30 |title=Using Hyphens in Compound Adjectives (and Exceptions to the Rule) |first=John |last=Davis |accessdate=2010-01-05 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions.

For example, ''wholly owned subsidiary'' and ''quickly moving vehicle'' are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: \"quickly\" cannot modify \"vehicle\".\n\nHowever, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide.<ref name=\"Grammar book\" /> For example, the phrase ''{{nowrap|more-important}} reasons'' (\"reasons that are more important\") is distinguished from ''more important reasons'' (\"additional important reasons\"), where ''more'' is an adjective. Similarly, ''{{nowrap|more-beautiful}} scenery'' (with a [[mass noun|mass-noun]]) is distinct from ''more beautiful scenery''. (In contrast, the hyphen in \"a {{nowrap|more-important}} reason\" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words\u2014such as ''well'', ''ill'', ''little'', and ''much''\u2014attract special attention in this category.<ref name=\"Economist 12\" /> The hyphen in \"well-[past_participled] noun\", such as in \"[[Cellular differentiation|well-differentiated cells]]\", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because ''early'' has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with ''advanced-stage disease'' and ''adult-onset disease'', like the parallelism of ''early-stage disease'' and ''early-onset disease''. Similarly, the hyphen in ''little-celebrated paintings'' clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings.\n\nHyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun),<ref name=\"AMA10section8.3.1\">{{cite book |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al.

This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus ''{{nowrap|28-year-old}} woman'' and ''{{nowrap|twenty-eight-year-old}} woman'' or ''{{nowrap|32-foot}} wingspan'' and ''{{nowrap|thirty-two-foot}} wingspan'', but ''the woman is 28 years old'' and ''a wingspan of 32 feet''.{{efn|name=Plural nouns|With numbers greater than two, where a plural noun would normally be used in an unhyphenated predicative position, the singular form of the noun is generally used in the hyphenated form used attributively. Thus ''a woman who is 28 years old'' becomes ''a {{nowrap|28-year-old}} woman''. There are occasional exceptions to this general rule, for instance with fractions (''a two-thirds majority'') and irregular plurals (''a two-criteria review'', ''a two-teeth bridge'').}} However, with symbols for [[SI]] units (such as ''[[metre|m]]'' or ''[[kilogram|kg]]'')\u2014as opposed to the ''names'' of these units (such as ''[[metre]]'' or ''[[kilogram]]'')\u2014both the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] recommend use without a hyphen: ''a 25&nbsp;kg sphere''. When the units are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: ''a {{nowrap|25-kilogram}} sphere'', ''a roll of {{nowrap|35-millimeter}} film''.<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf \"The International System of Units (SI)\"], [[BIPM|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]], 2006</ref><ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf \"Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)\"], NIST Special Publication 811, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], March 2008</ref>\n\nIn spelled-out [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus ''{{nowrap|two-thirds}} majority''{{efn|name=Plural nouns}} and ''{{nowrap|one-eighth}} portion'' but ''I drank two thirds of the bottle'' or ''I kept three quarters of it for myself''.<ref name=\"APA6section4.13\">{{Citation |author=American Psychological Association (APA) |authorlink=American Psychological Association |year=2010 |title=The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association |edition=6th |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-4338-0562-2 |url=http://apastyle.org/ |postscript=.}}</ref> However, at least one major style guide<ref name=\"AMA10section8.3.1\" /> hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).\n\nIn English, {{Anchor|En dash, hyphen, or either one}} an [[en dash]] ( \u2013 ) sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, ''San Francisco\u2013area residents'', ''hormone receptor\u2013positive cells'', ''cell cycle\u2013related factors'', and ''public-school\u2013private-school rivalries'').<ref name=\"LutzStevenson2005\">{{cite book|author1=Gary Lutz|author2=Diane Stevenson|title=The Writer's Digest grammar desk reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsQ9ugnMcpUC&pg=PA296|year=2005|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-335-7|page=296}}</ref> A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (''hormone-receptor-positive cells'', ''cell-cycle-related factors''). (For other aspects of en dash\u2013versus\u2013hyphen use, see ''[[Dash#En dash|Dash > En dash]]''.)\n\n==== Object\u2013verbal-noun compounds ====\n\n{{anchor|Object\u2013verbal noun compounds||reason=Old section name; lots of redirs point here.}}\n\nWhen an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as ''[[Mixer (cooking)|egg-beater]]'' (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, ''egg-beater, egg beater,'' and ''eggbeater'' are all common.\n\nAn example of an ambiguous phrase appears in ''they stood near a group of alien lovers'', which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; ''they stood near a group of alien-lovers'' clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as \"alien\" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase ''a hungry pizza-lover'', the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as \"pizza\" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous.\n\nSimilarly, ''there's a man-eating shark in these waters'' is nearly the opposite of ''there's a man eating shark at table 6''; the first is a shark, and the second a man. ''A government-monitoring program'' is a program that monitors the government, whereas ''a government monitoring program'' is a government program that monitors something else.\n\n==== Personal names ====\n{{See also|Spanish naming customs#Hyphenation|Portuguese name#Hyphenation}}\n\nSome married couples compose a new [[surname]] (sometimes referred to as a [[double-barrelled name]]) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname.\n\nWith already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped. For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] and [[Sam Taylor-Johnson]]. Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] is a descendant of Louis Leml\u00e9 Dreyfus whose son was L\u00e9opold Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n==== Other compounds ====\n\nConnecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in ''lily-of-the-valley'', ''cock-a-hoop'', ''clever-clever'', ''tittle-tattle'' and ''orang-utan''. Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, ''orang-utan'' is also written as ''orangutan'' or ''orang utan'', and ''lily-of-the-valley'' may be hyphenated or not.\n\n==== Suspended hyphens ====\n<!-- Section header used as link target in redirects -->\n\nA '''suspended hyphen''' (also called a '''suspensive hyphen''' or '''hanging hyphen''', or less commonly a '''dangling''' or '''floating hyphen''') may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words that are connected by \"and\", \"or\", or \"to\". For example, ''nineteenth-century and twentieth-century'' may be written as ''nineteenth- and twentieth-century.'' This usage is now common and specifically recommended in some style guides.<ref name=\"IU Style Guide\">E.g. {{cite web |url= https://brand.iu.edu/messaging-strategy/editorial-style/style-guide/h.html |title=H |work=The IU editorial style guide |publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref> Suspended hyphens are also used, though less commonly, when the base word comes first, such as in \"investor-owned and {{nowrap|-operated}}\". Uses such as \"applied and sociolinguistics\" (instead of \"applied linguistics and sociolinguistics\") are frowned upon; the Indiana University style guide uses this example and says \"Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open\" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words).<ref name=\"IU Style Guide\" /> This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, ''{{nowrap|preoperative and postoperative}}'' becomes ''{{nowrap|pre- and postoperative}}'' (not ''{{nowrap|pre- and post-operative}}'') when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.<ref name=\"AMA10section8.3.1\" />\n\n=== Other uses ===\n\nA hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in dates (see below), telephone numbers or sports scores. It can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an [[en dash]] (see examples at {{mslink|Dash|En dash|Ranges of values}}).\n\nThe hyphen is sometimes used to hide letters in words ([[fillet (redaction)|filleting for redaction or censoring]]), as in [[G-d]], although an en dash can be used as well (\"G\u2013d\").\n\nThe hyphen is often used in [[Reduplication|reduplicatives]].\n\n== Varied meanings ==\n\nSome stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens to mark attributive phrases:\n* ''Disease-causing poor nutrition'' is poor nutrition that causes disease.\n* ''Disease causing poor nutrition'' is a disease that causes poor nutrition.\n* A ''hard-working man'' is a man who works hard.\n* A ''hard working man'' is a working man who is tough.\n* A ''man-eating shark'' is a shark that eats humans.\n* A ''man eating shark'' is a man who is eating shark meat.\n* ''Three-hundred-year-old trees'' are an indeterminate number of trees that are each 300 years old.\n* ''Three hundred-year-old trees'' are three trees that are each 100 years old.\n* ''Three hundred year-old trees'' are 300 trees that are each a year old.\n\n== Origin and history ==\n\nThe first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of [[Dionysius Thrax]]. At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low [[tie (typography)|tie mark]] between the two words.<ref name=\"nicky\">Nicolas, Nick. \"[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |date=6 August 2012 }}\". 2005.

Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines.<ref name=\"Houston2013\">{{cite book|author=Keith Houston|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA132|year= 2013|publisher=W.W.

Library of Congress]] shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing rigid frame. Gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His hyphen appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.\n\n== In computing ==\n=== Hyphen-minus ===\n\n{{Main|Hyphen-minus}}\n\nIn the [[ASCII]] [[character encoding]], the hyphen is encoded as character 45. This character is sometimes called the [[hyphen-minus]], as it is also used as the minus sign and even sometimes for [[dash]]es. In [[Unicode]], the hyphen-minus is encoded as {{U+|002D}} (-) so that Unicode remains compatible with ASCII. However, Unicode also encodes the hyphen and minus separately, as U+2010 (\u2010) and U+2212 (\u2212) respectively, along with the em dash U+2014 (\u2014), en dash U+2013 (\u2013) and other related characters. On Android, the Unicode hyphen and the hyphen-minus are similar but not identical (compare:\u2010-). The hyphen-minus is a general-purpose character that attempts to fulfill several roles, and wherever optimal typography is desired, the preferred hyphen, minus, or other symbol should be used instead. For example, compare 4+3\u22122=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus); in most fonts the hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character will not.\n\nHowever, the Unicode hyphen is awkward to enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus character remains very common. It is often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via [[dialog box]]es or multi-key, unmemorable [[keyboard shortcut]]s), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.\n\nThe ASCII hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying [[command-line option]]s. The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the [[getopt]] function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters (&nbsp;--&nbsp;) to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipelining]] in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized [[wikt:in lieu|in lieu]] of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a [[standard streams|standard stream]], instead of a file, is to be worked with.\n\n=== Hard and soft hyphens ===\n\n{{Further|Soft hyphen}}\n\nAlthough software ([[hyphenation algorithm]]s) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a [[soft hyphen]] (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is ''allowed'' but not ''forced''. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.\n\nIn contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a {{Anchor|hard hyphen}}'''hard hyphen''' (although some use this term to refer to a non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation ''may'' occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using [[hyphenation algorithm]]s are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.\n\n=== Nonbreaking hyphens ===\n<!-- Section header used as link target in redirects -->\n\nThe '''nonbreaking hyphen''', '''non-breaking hyphen''', or '''no-break hyphen''' looks identical to the regular hyphen, but word processors treat it as a letter, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what would be the end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The [[non-breaking space]] exists for similar reasons.\n\nThe [[word segmentation]] rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a [[word boundary (linguistics)|word boundary]] and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. However, this is not always desirable behavior, especially when it could lead to ambiguity (such as in the examples given before, where ''recreation'' and ''re\u2011creation'' would be indistinguishable), or in languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|an t\u2011athair}} or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|s\u2011a}} would be undesirable). {{Anchor|non-breaking hyphen}}In Unicode it is defined as {{unichar|2011|NON-BREAKING HYPHEN|html=}}.\n\n== Usage in date notation ==\n\n{{Further|Date and time representation by country}}\n\nIn parts of [[Europe]], the hyphen is used to delineate parts within a written date. Germans{{cn|date=February 2020}} and Slavs also used [[Roman numerals]] for the month; ''14\u2011VII\u20111789'' (14 July 1789), for example, is one way of writing the first [[Bastille Day]], though this usage is rapidly falling out of favour. Plaques on the wall of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] are written this way. Use of hyphens, as opposed to the slashes used in the [[English language]], is specified for international standards.\n\n[[International standard]] [[ISO 8601]], which was accepted as European Standard EN 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g., [[DIN]] 5008 in Germany), brought about a new standard using the hyphen. Now all official European governmental documents use this. These norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens: 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first Bastille Day. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.\n\nThis method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer filesystems make the use of slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \\ and / as directory separators, but / is also used to introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \\ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard American representation.\n\n== Unicode ==\n\nApart from dash and minus sign, Unicode has multiple hyphen characters:<ref name=\"PropList\">{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt|title=Unicode 13.0 UCD: PropList.txt|date=2019-11-27|accessdate=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n* {{unichar|002D|HYPHEN-MINUS|html=y|nlink=hyphen-minus}}, a character of multiple uses\n* {{unichar|00AD|SOFT HYPHEN|html=y}} (see '''[[#SHY-note|note]]''')\n* {{unichar|2010|HYPHEN|html=y}}\n* {{unichar|2011|NON-BREAKING HYPHEN|html=y}}\n{{anchor|SHY-note}}'''Note''': The [[Soft hyphen#Text to be formatted by the recipient|{{sc|soft hyphen}}]] serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed.

[[Incidental music]] for the original production was written by [[Darius Milhaud]].<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGaston, a veteran of [[World War I]], suffers from [[amnesia]] and has spent the last 18 years in a hospital trying to regain his memories. Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was first presented on 16 February 1937 and was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.

[[grand final]] weekend for the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) to determine the champion teams of the Women's SBL and Men's SBL. The current format of the WSBL championship game on the Friday night and the MSBL championship game on the Saturday night has been in place since 2001. All grand finals have been played in a one-game championship decider, except in 1995 when a best-of-three series was introduced for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbl.asn.au/past-champions/|title=PAST CHAMPIONS|work=SBL.asn.au|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nUp until 1990, the event was held at [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. In 1991, the event was moved to the much larger [[Perth Superdrome]], where it remained until returning to Perry Lakes in 2000. In 2010, the [[WA Basketball Centre]] replaced Perry Lakes as the home of basketball and as the SBL Grand Finals host venue.<ref>{{cite

They are mostly common in [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], though this does not exclude other [[video game genres]], such as some [[platformers]] and [[strategy game]]s.\n\nOverworlds generally feature a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] view or a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] of the [[Imaginary world|fictional world]] within the game. It often contains varied terrain (including caves, mountains, forests, and bodies of water) and a collection of towns and other locations (most commonly [[Dungeon crawl|dungeons]] or [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]). When the party enters one of these locations the world map display may remain on the screen, be replaced by the local geography, or be hidden until the party exits the location. In many games, the player is able to travel on the world map; in other games, the player uses the world map to select their next location. Typically, a dungeon houses a host of enemies, while a town usually is safe. In some games, there are a series of world maps.{{efn|In some ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, for example, the player can travel between the earth and the moon, each of which has its own world map. Additionally, in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', once the player obtains an airship, they may leave their current world to find themselves in a larger world map with a selection representing the first world.}} Some games allow the player to view only a portion of the world map at the beginning of the game, with new locations becoming visible as the game progresses, whereas other games show the entire world map from the beginning. The opposite term \"underworld\" refers to the world underneath the ground.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Role-playing video games===\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth httt world map.png|thumb|right|Overworld map from the video game ''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]''.]]\nThe [[Ultima (series)|Ultima series]] of [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] marks one of the first uses of an overworld. Many games have emulated ''Ultima''{{'}}s overworlds, especially fantasy-based ones. The most prominent example in this category is the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]]. In each of this type of overworld game, most of the action (or at least most of the plot-advancing action) takes place in towns, forests, dungeons, caves, castles (and the surrounding area), camps, fortresses, mass transportation systems, celestial bodies (e.g. the moon), and other locations. In the ''Dragon Quest'' series, the overworld is used as a \"travel map\", and changes to a closer perspective for direct gameplay or confrontation. The overworlds featured in most of the 2D adventures of this genre commonly depict the character(s)' proportions as larger than they actually would be in the world being travelled, thus lending necessary visibility to the player. The characters' animation in this type of overworld is often simpler than that found in the game's menus and other areas, while more complicated movement such as combat, climbing or visibly handling objects sometimes happens at closer perspectives, and often involves [[cutscene]]s.\n\n===''The Legend of Zelda'' series===\nWhile previous games have featured overworlds, one of the earliest console games to feature an overworld is the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. Gameplay in ''Zelda''{{'}}s overworld was virtually identical to that of its nine underground dungeon levels, offering a [[top-down perspective]] and including access to caves, bridges, mazes, shops and waterfalls as well as lurking dangers that range from enemies to tumbling rocks. Much of the immediate gameplay takes place in the overworld, and the diversity of terrain (as well as the sheer size of the overworld itself) ensures that the player will spend as much time exploring and searching above ground as they will below (or in any of the areas listed above). The concept of an overworld also offered a [[non-linear gameplay]] experience;<ref name=\"rpgamer review\">{{cite web | author=Long, Andrew | year= | title=Oldest School | publisher=RPGamer | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/zelda/z1/reviews/z1strev1.html | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> some believed this would cause the player to become confused and not know where to go, a sentiment which has endured as overworlds have become larger and more complex.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe ''Zelda'' series is well known for these large overworld areas, such as [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule Field|Hyrule Field]]. Many enemies inhabit the various overworlds. The player can see most of these without any special tools, and most are easily defeated or avoided. The game [[Minecraft]] is another popular example of a platform game with an Overworld.\n\nThere are special items available in most of the overworld areas in the series, but these are often non-essential to completing the overall objective; the main purpose served by an overworld is to connect more important places.\n\n===Platform games===\nAlthough large-scale overworlds were popularized by ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in 1986, the genre of [[platform game]]s did not have overworlds (in the main sense) until [[Platform game#Reshaping the genre|3D platformers]] appeared in the mid-1990s. The concept of an overworld in platform gaming prior to that time was limited to a \"level select\" style, which first was featured in the multi-genre [[Arcade game|arcade]] title ''[[Dragon Buster]]'',<ref>{{allgame|id=9953|Dragon Buster}}</ref> and popularized by other games such as ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.{{efn|In these and similar games, the character doesn't actually travel on a world map (viz. freedom to move is strictly limited to linear direction); rather, the player only repositions the character on an adjacent location (a dot or icon that represents a level) that is connected by a rail (which may not be visible) to other adjacent locations. The ''[[Wild Arms (series)|Wild Arms]]'' series and the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular examples.}}\nIn ''[[Spyro]]'' the first 3 games had a place called a \"home world\" that was like an over world. It contained portals to other levels of the game.\n\nPrevious titles like ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Castlevania#Film|Castlevania]]'' revolved around the player completing levels in a linear order, with no option to return to completed levels. It is likely that the overworlds developed for [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games, such as some of those listed above, evolved from the level-select type overworlds featured in prior 2D platform games, such as those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/product/specs/prtprdid,16515230/specs.html PC World \u2013 Super Mario Advance 4 (GBA) Test Report]</ref> Beginning with ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', every [[Super Mario|''Mario'' platformer]] has featured either a level-select type overworld (e.g. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'') or a hub-type overworld (e.g. Peach's Castle in ''[[Super Mario 64#Setting|Super Mario 64]]'' and the Comet Observatory in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'') \u2013 a central, usually enemy-free area \u2013 that connects to levels and other important places. As the genre evolved and became more popular, the overworld concept expanded into other platformers \u2013 from ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'' to the [[Donkey Kong (series)#Successors|''Donkey Kong'' series]] \u2013 becoming a staple of the genre that endures as a prominent feature.\n\n===''Minecraft''===\n[[Minecraft]] is an extremely popular platform and sandbox video game, available on nearly every platform, excluding [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. This game's overworld is a default, meaning the player is situated in the overworld by default,  unless the game is modified. Minecraft's overworld is one of the most popular overworld maps.\n\n===Home level===\n[[File:Angband.png|thumb|The town level in the roguelike game ''Angband''.]]\nA '''home level''' is an area found within a [[roguelike]] [[video game]]. It is usually a haven for the hero characters, where enemy hostility is minimal. In most cases, the home level features shops in which the player can purchase items, and is often the initial site of the story or game, although in some games it is a location discovered later. In some games, such as ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'', as the story progresses, the location of the home level may change, or there may be other such places that serve a similar purpose. ''[[Larn (video game)|Larn]]'', a 1980s roguelike game, was among the earliest to feature a home level.\n\nSome games feature a home level that contains many different points of interest. The home level in ''[[Angband (video game)|Angband]]'', for instance, consists of seven shops, the player's home (where characters may store unneeded items), and a staircase to the first dungeon [[Level (video games)|level]]. Some variants of the home level add speciality shops, quest locations, or a wilderness through which additional towns can be discovered.\n\n==Navigation==\nMany of the games that have an overworld feature a world map of some sort; these range from very basic \u2013 such as a grey rectangle with a dot indicating the position of the character in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' \u2013 to an overworld map that can be toggled on and off, but shows only rough outlines of various locations, as well as the character's ever-changing location, such as in later instalments in the ''Zelda'' series, or many ''Final Fantasy'' games.\n\nOther games, including several instalments in the ''Ultima'' and ''Wasteland'' series, include detailed, often colourful maps on cloth or paper that came bundled with the game and is meant to be used to navigate while playing the game. Games like ''Miracle Warriors'' even came with a little action figure in metal meant to be placed on your position.\n\nWhatever the map style employed (if any), varied world map terrain such as mountains, rivers and deserts may prevent the character(s) from visiting an area until they have completed a certain task or acquired a special skill, vehicle or other key item.{{efn|For example, in many [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''Zelda'']] games, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must obtain an item hidden in one dungeon that will allow him to progress to the next dungeon. Often, these items can be obtained only after completing a side quest or reaching a certain point in the game.}} Many [[Role-playing video game|CRPGs]] eventually allow the player rapid movement around the overworld, using such methods as flying,{{efn|Many games, most notably those of the [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' series]], provide [[airship]]s for flying. Other games will feature flying animals such as large birds, [[Chocobo]]s or [[dragon]]s.}} sailing, or [[Teleportation|teleporting]] to various locations. The map icon is often represented as a rectangle. Usually, flying or sailing across one edge of the map will bring the character(s) to the edge of the opposite side.\n\nIn some games, certain areas of the overworld map are hidden from the player, or at least difficult to reach; these \"secret\" areas often contain difficult-to-obtain items, or they might simply hold [[Easter egg (virtual)|\"Easter Egg\"]]-style novelties or other such diversions. In some games, especially those that have a \"level select\" style of overworld (e.g. a lot of old-school [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game]]s), portions of the overworld become available for play as certain tasks are completed (e.g. beating a particular level or discovering a secret hidden within a level).\n\n==Audio design==\nIn terms of [[video game music]], overworld themes are often orchestral in nature, and of greater length and complexity than other pieces in the same game, due to the amount of time spent travelling the overworld map.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Because players will usually visit a single level or area a few times in a given play session, the music for any such section of the game will typically be shorter and/or less complex,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89565567 \"The Evolution of Video Game Music\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', July 28, 2008.</ref> and thus less time-consuming for the designers to produce. The overworld theme frequently functions as a main theme of a game, often used as a [[Motif (music)|motif]] for other tracks (e.g., a \"romance\" theme features the main melody of overworld theme, orchestrated in a different key).<ref>[http://www.ubu.com/sound/price/video/price_video_vidz.pdf Early Video Game Soundtracks] 2001 article on video game music, orig.

The game [[Minecraft]] is another popular example of a platform game with an Overworld.\n\nThere are special items available in most of the overworld areas in the series, but these are often non-essential to completing the overall objective; the main purpose served by an overworld is to connect more important places.\n\n===Platform games===\nAlthough large-scale overworlds were popularized by ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in 1986, the genre of [[platform game]]s did not have overworlds (in the main sense) until [[Platform game#Reshaping the genre|3D platformers]] appeared in the mid-1990s. The concept of an overworld in platform gaming prior to that time was limited to a \"level select\" style, which first was featured in the multi-genre [[Arcade game|arcade]] title ''[[Dragon Buster]]'',<ref>{{allgame|id=9953|Dragon Buster}}</ref> and popularized by other games such as ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.{{efn|In these and similar games, the character doesn't actually travel on a world map (viz. freedom to move is strictly limited to linear direction); rather, the player only repositions the character on an adjacent location (a dot or icon that represents a level) that is connected by a rail (which may not be visible) to other adjacent locations. The ''[[Wild Arms (series)|Wild Arms]]'' series and the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular examples.}}\nIn ''[[Spyro]]'' the first 3 games had a place called a \"home world\" that was like an over world. It contained portals to other levels of the game.\n\nPrevious titles like ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Castlevania#Film|Castlevania]]'' revolved around the player completing levels in a linear order, with no option to return to completed levels. It is likely that the overworlds developed for [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games, such as some of those listed above, evolved from the level-select type overworlds featured in prior 2D platform games, such as those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/product/specs/prtprdid,16515230/specs.html PC World \u2013 Super Mario Advance 4 (GBA) Test Report]</ref> Beginning with ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', every [[Super Mario|''Mario'' platformer]] has featured either a level-select type overworld (e.g. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'') or a hub-type overworld (e.g. Peach's Castle in ''[[Super Mario 64#Setting|Super Mario 64]]'' and the Comet Observatory in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'') \u2013 a central, usually enemy-free area \u2013 that connects to levels and other important places. As the genre evolved and became more popular, the overworld concept expanded into other platformers \u2013 from ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'' to the [[Donkey Kong (series)#Successors|''Donkey Kong'' series]] \u2013 becoming a staple of the genre that endures as a prominent feature.\n\n===''Minecraft''===\n[[Minecraft]] is an extremely popular platform and sandbox video game, available on nearly every platform, excluding [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. This game's overworld is a default, meaning the player is situated in the overworld by default,  unless the game is modified. Minecraft's overworld is one of the most popular overworld maps.\n\n===Home level===\n[[File:Angband.png|thumb|The town level in the roguelike game ''Angband''.]]\nA '''home level''' is an area found within a [[roguelike]] [[video game]]. It is usually a haven for the hero characters, where enemy hostility is minimal. In most cases, the home level features shops in which the player can purchase items, and is often the initial site of the story or game, although in some games it is a location discovered later. In some games, such as ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'', as the story progresses, the location of the home level may change, or there may be other such places that serve a similar purpose. ''[[Larn (video game)|Larn]]'', a 1980s roguelike game, was among the earliest to feature a home level.\n\nSome games feature a home level that contains many different points of interest. The home level in ''[[Angband (video game)|Angband]]'', for instance, consists of seven shops, the player's home (where characters may store unneeded items), and a staircase to the first dungeon [[Level (video games)|level]]. Some variants of the home level add speciality shops, quest locations, or a wilderness through which additional towns can be discovered.\n\n==Navigation==\nMany of the games that have an overworld feature a world map of some sort; these range from very basic \u2013 such as a grey rectangle with a dot indicating the position of the character in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' \u2013 to an overworld map that can be toggled on and off, but shows only rough outlines of various locations, as well as the character's ever-changing location, such as in later instalments in the ''Zelda'' series, or many ''Final Fantasy'' games.\n\nOther games, including several instalments in the ''Ultima'' and ''Wasteland'' series, include detailed, often colourful maps on cloth or paper that came bundled with the game and is meant to be used to navigate while playing the game. Games like ''Miracle Warriors'' even came with a little action figure in metal meant to be placed on your position.\n\nWhatever the map style employed (if any), varied world map terrain such as mountains, rivers and deserts may prevent the character(s) from visiting an area until they have completed a certain task or acquired a special skill, vehicle or other key item.{{efn|For example, in many [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''Zelda'']] games, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must obtain an item hidden in one dungeon that will allow him to progress to the next dungeon. Often, these items can be obtained only after completing a side quest or reaching a certain point in the game.}} Many [[Role-playing video game|CRPGs]] eventually allow the player rapid movement around the overworld, using such methods as flying,{{efn|Many games, most notably those of the [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' series]], provide [[airship]]s for flying. Other games will feature flying animals such as large birds, [[Chocobo]]s or [[dragon]]s.}} sailing, or [[Teleportation|teleporting]] to various locations. The map icon is often represented as a rectangle. Usually, flying or sailing across one edge of the map will bring the character(s) to the edge of the opposite side.\n\nIn some games, certain areas of the overworld map are hidden from the player, or at least difficult to reach; these \"secret\" areas often contain difficult-to-obtain items, or they might simply hold [[Easter egg (virtual)|\"Easter Egg\"]]-style novelties or other such diversions. In some games, especially those that have a \"level select\" style of overworld (e.g. a lot of old-school [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game]]s), portions of the overworld become available for play as certain tasks are completed (e.g. beating a particular level or discovering a secret hidden within a level).\n\n==Audio design==\nIn terms of [[video game music]], overworld themes are often orchestral in nature, and of greater length and complexity than other pieces in the same game, due to the amount of time spent traveling the overworld map.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Because players will usually visit a single level or area a few times in a given play session, the music for any such section of the game will typically be shorter and/or less complex,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89565567 \"The Evolution of Video Game Music\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', July 28, 2008.</ref> and thus less time-consuming for the designers to produce. The overworld theme frequently functions as a main theme of a game, often used as a [[Motif (music)|motif]] for other tracks (e.g., a \"romance\" theme features the main melody of overworld theme, orchestrated in a different key).<ref>[http://www.ubu.com/sound/price/video/price_video_vidz.pdf Early Video Game Soundtracks] 2001 article on video game music, orig. published in In Magazine.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Level (video gaming)|Level]]\n* [[Level design]]\n* [[Open world]]\n* [[Role-playing video game]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Video game gameplay]]\n", "name_user": "Burco18", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAudio design:Cleanup", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overworld"}
