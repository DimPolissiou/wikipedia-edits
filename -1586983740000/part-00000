It was founded in early 2019 by [[Nigel Farage]], former leader of the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), and won the most votes at the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|May 2019 European Parliament elections]]. The Brexit Party has largely replaced UKIP in British politics, with UKIP (which gained 12.6% of the vote but just one MP at the 2015 election) losing almost all its support. UKIP stood in 42 seats in Great Britain and two seats in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe [[Green Party of England and Wales]] has been led by [[Jonathan Bartley]] and [[Si\u00e2n Berry]] since 2018, with its counterpart the [[Scottish Green Party]] standing in Scottish seats. The two parties stood in a total of 495 seats. The third-largest party in seats won at the 2017 election was the [[Scottish National Party]], led by [[Nicola Sturgeon]] since 2014, which stands only in Scotland but holds the majority (35 of 59 before this election) of seats there.

Labour's vision, the IFS said, \"is of a state not so dissimilar to those seen in many other successful Western European economies\" and presumed that the manifesto should be seen as \"a long-term prospectus for change rather than a realistic deliverable plan for a five-year parliament\".<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> They said the Liberal Democrat manifesto is not as radical as the Labour manifesto but was a \"decisive move away from the policies of the past decade\".<ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\nThe Conservative manifesto was criticised for a commitment not to raise rates of income tax, [[National Insurance|NICs]] or [[Value-added tax|VAT]] as this put a significant constraint on reactions to events that might affect government finances. One such event could be the \"die in a ditch\" promise to terminate the Brexit transition period by the end of 2020, which risked harming the economy.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> The IFS also stated that it is \"highly likely\" spending under a Conservative government would be higher than in that party's manifesto, partly due to a number of uncosted commitments.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> Outside of commitments to the NHS, the proposals would leave public service spending 14% lower in 2023\u20132024 than it was in 2010\u20132011, which the IFS described as \"no more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in\".<ref name=\"IFSStand\">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tax-rises-coming-whoever-wins-the-election-leading-economists-warn-a4299121.html |title=Tax rises coming whoever wins the election, leading economists warn |date=27 November 2019 |newspaper=Evening Standard |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe IFS stated it had \"serious doubt\" that tax rises proposed would raise the amount Labour suggested, and said that they would need to introduce more broad based tax increases. They assess that the public sector does not have the capacity to increase investment spending as Labour would want. The IFS assesses the claim that tax rises will only hit the top 5% of earners, as \"certainly progressive\", but \"clearly not true\", with those under that threshold impacted by changes to the marriage allowance, taxes on dividends or capital gains, and lower wages/higher prices that might be passed on from corporation tax changes. Some of Labour's proposals are described as \"huge and complex undertakings\", where significant care is required in implementation. The IFS is particularly critical of the policy to compensate the so-called \"WASPI women\", announced after the manifesto, which is a \u00a358bn promise to women who are \"relatively well off on average\" and will result in public finances going off target. They said that Labour's manifesto would not increase UK public spending as a share of national income above Germany.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> They found that Labour's plan to spend and invest would boost economic growth, but the impact of tax rises, government regulation, nationalisations and the inclusive ownership fund could reduce growth, meaning the overall impact of Labour's plan on growth is uncertain.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS described the Liberal Democrats' plans as a \"radical\" tax and spend package, and said that the proposals would require lower borrowing than Conservative or Labour plans. The report said they were the only party whose proposals would put debt \"on a decisively downward path\", praising their plan to put 1p on income tax to go to the NHS as \"simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue\". The IFS also said plans to \"virtually quintuple\" current spending levels on universal free childcare amounted to \"creating a whole new leg of the universal welfare state\".<ref name=\"IFSStand2\">{{Cite newspaper|title=IFS key verdicts on the party spending plans|date=28 November 2019|newspaper=Evening Standard|page=5|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS said that the SNP's manifesto was not costed.

Labour's vision, the IFS said, \"is of a state not so dissimilar to those seen in many other successful Western European economies\" and presumed that the manifesto should be seen as \"a long-term prospectus for change rather than a realistic deliverable plan for a five-year parliament\".<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> They said the Liberal Democrat manifesto is not as radical as the Labour manifesto but was a \"decisive move away from the policies of the past decade\".<ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\nThe Conservative manifesto was criticised for a commitment not to raise rates of income tax, [[National Insurance|NICs]] or [[Value-added tax|VAT]] as this put a significant constraint on reactions to events that might affect government finances. One such event could be the \"die in a ditch\" promise to terminate the Brexit transition period by the end of 2020, which risked harming the economy.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> The IFS also stated that it is \"highly likely\" spending under a Conservative government would be higher than in that party's manifesto, partly due to a number of uncosted commitments.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> Outside of commitments to the NHS, the proposals would leave public service spending 14% lower in 2023\u20132024 than it was in 2010\u20132011, which the IFS described as \"no more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in\".<ref name=\"IFSStand\">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tax-rises-coming-whoever-wins-the-election-leading-economists-warn-a4299121.html |title=Tax rises coming whoever wins the election, leading economists warn |date=27 November 2019 |newspaper=Evening Standard |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe IFS stated it had \"serious doubt\" that tax rises proposed would raise the amount Labour suggested, and said that they would need to introduce more broad based tax increases. They assess that the public sector does not have the capacity to increase investment spending as Labour would want. The IFS assesses the claim that tax rises will only hit the top 5% of earners, as \"certainly progressive\", but \"clearly not true\", with those under that threshold impacted by changes to the marriage allowance, taxes on dividends or capital gains, and lower wages/higher prices that might be passed on from corporation tax changes. Some of Labour's proposals are described as \"huge and complex undertakings\", where significant care is required in implementation. The IFS is particularly critical of the policy to compensate the so-called \"WASPI women\", announced after the manifesto, which is a \u00a358bn promise to women who are \"relatively well off on average\" and will result in public finances going off target. They said that Labour's manifesto would not increase UK public spending as a share of national income above Germany.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> They found that Labour's plan to spend and invest would boost economic growth, but the impact of tax rises, government regulation, nationalisations and the inclusive ownership fund could reduce growth, meaning the overall impact of Labour's plan on growth is uncertain.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS described the Liberal Democrats' plans as a \"radical\" tax and spend package, and said that the proposals would require lower borrowing than Conservative or Labour plans. The report said they were the only party whose proposals would put debt \"on a decisively downward path\", praising their plan to put 1p on income tax to go to the NHS as \"simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue\". The IFS also said plans to \"virtually quintuple\" current spending levels on universal free childcare amounted to \"creating a whole new leg of the universal welfare state\".<ref name=\"IFSStand2\">{{Cite newspaper|title=IFS key verdicts on the party spending plans|date=28 November 2019|newspaper=Evening Standard|page=5|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS said that the SNP's manifesto was not costed.

{"title_page": "Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2015}}\nThe '''Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food''' was a United Kingdom cabinet position, responsible for the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]. The post was originally named President of the Board of Agriculture and was created in 1889. In 1903, an Act was passed to transfer to the new styled Board of Agriculture and Fisheries certain powers and duties relating to the fishing industry, and the post was renamed President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\nIn 1919, it was renamed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1954, the separate position of [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Minister of Food]] was merged into the post and it was renamed Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Successive Prime Ministers asked the Minister to upgrade the Ministry to a Department of State taking the title 'Secretary of State', but all refused.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nOn 8 June 2001, the Ministry merged with [[Secretary of State for the Environment]] into the office of [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. However, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was not formally abolished until The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794) came into force on 27 March 2002.\n\nUntil the Dissolution Order also made the necessary amendments to the law when it did come into force, many statutory functions were still vested in the holder of the office of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, rather in the Secretary of State at large. For that reason, in a final twist, [[Margaret Beckett]] had to be appointed formally as the last ever Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as becoming the first Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nThe role is currently held by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]].\n\n== List of Agriculture Ministers and Board Presidents ==\n\n=== Presidents of the Board of Agriculture (1889\u20131903) ===\n\nPost created by the Board of Agriculture Act 1889.<ref>Board of Agriculture Act 1889 (52 and 53 Vict c 30)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|+President of the Board of Agriculture <ref name=\"Cook & Keith\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Chris |last2=Keith |first2=Brendan |date=1975 |title=British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900 |url=https://archive.org/details/britishhistorica0000cook |url-access=registration |location=London and Basingstoke |publisher=The Macmillan Press Ltd |page=[https://archive.org/details/britishhistorica0000cook/page/52 52] }}</ref>\n! colspan=2 | Portrait\n!

Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]. The post was originally named President of the Board of Agriculture and was created in 1889. In 1903, an Act was passed to transfer to the new styled Board of Agriculture and Fisheries certain powers and duties relating to the fishing industry, and the post was renamed President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\nIn 1919, it was renamed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1954, the separate position of [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Minister of Food]] was merged into the post and it was renamed Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Successive Prime Ministers asked the Minister to upgrade the Ministry to a Department of State taking the title 'Secretary of State', but all refused.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nOn 8 June 2001, the Ministry merged with [[Secretary of State for the Environment]] into the office of [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. However, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was not formally abolished until The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794) came into force on 27 March 2002.\n\nUntil the Dissolution Order also made the necessary amendments to the law when it did come into force, many statutory functions were still vested in the holder of the office of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, rather in the Secretary of State at large. For that reason, in a final twist, [[Margaret Beckett]] had to be appointed formally as the last ever Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as becoming the first Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nThe role is currently held by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]].\n\n== List of Agriculture Ministers and Board Presidents ==\n\n=== Presidents of the Board of Agriculture (1889\u20131903) ===\n\nPost created by the Board of Agriculture Act 1889.<ref>Board of Agriculture Act 1889 (52 and 53 Vict c 30)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|+President of the Board of Agriculture <ref name=\"Cook & Keith\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Chris |last2=Keith |first2=Brendan |date=1975 |title=British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900 |url=https://archive.org/details/britishhistorica0000cook |url-access=registration |location=London and Basingstoke |publisher=The Macmillan Press Ltd |page=[https://archive.org/details/britishhistorica0000cook/page/52 52] }}</ref>\n! colspan=2 | Portrait\n!

They compete in the [[Mid-American Conference]] for most sports.\n\n==History==\n[[File:EastCampus1915.jpg|thumb|left|Western State Normal School, 1915]]On May 27, 1903, Michigan Governor [[Aaron T.

Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school's location on August 28, 1903.  Other locations considered included [[Allegan, Michigan|Allegan]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Decatur, Michigan|Decatur]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], and [[Hastings, Michigan|Hastings]].  The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as East Hall, was constructed in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/1903/1903CampusDesign.htm |title=1903 Campus Plan &#124; Campus Planning &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University was first officially known as '''Western State Normal School''', and originally offered a two-year training program.  The first principal and president was [[Dwight B. Waldo]], who served from 1904 until 1936.  The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with '''Western State Teachers College''' in 1927, '''Michigan College of Education''' in 1941, and '''Western Michigan College''' in 1955. On February 26, 1957, Governor [[G. Mennen Williams]] signed a bill into law that made Western Michigan College the state's fourth public university and gave the school its current name of '''Western Michigan University'''.\n\nMost of the oldest and original WMU buildings and \"classrooms\" are collectively known as [[East Campus (Western Michigan University)|East Campus]], directly East from the more central \"West Campus\".\n\nAccess to the East Campus site was an issue because of the steep grade elevating it above the city. The [[Western State Normal Railroad]] was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill via a [[funicular]]. It operated until 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/Specialties/TrolleyCommemoration.htm |title=Western Trolley Commemoration &#124; Photos Images Trivia &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nWMU's campuses encompass more than {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} and roughly 150 buildings.

Many of the [[residence halls]] are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other [[dormitories]] (affectionately referred to as \"The Valleys\") are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley.\n\nThe Bernhard Center is a centrally located multi-purpose student union that provides student and community groups with meeting space. Located within the Bernhard Center is the Bronco Mall, a one-stop-shop for students which includes a large 24-hour computer lab, a [[food court]] featuring [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Biggby Coffee]], [[K-zoo Coney]], numerous tables and chairs for eating and socializing, a [[PNC Bank]], and one of two school [[bookstore]]s.  Waldo Library and the attached University Computing Center are on West Campus, as is the Dalton Musical Center. Recently constructed buildings on West Campus include the Western Heights [[dormitory]] and the Chemistry Building, which replaces aging McCracken Hall.\n\nWest Campus is also the site of [[Miller Auditorium]]. A large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people, it is Michigan's fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular [[musicals]] and [[concerts]] to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex, featuring three performance stages and faculty offices, is directly next to Miller Auditorium. The [[Richmond Center for Visual Arts]] was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into the Kohrman Hall Studios in 2008. Both buildings house the [[Gwen Frostic]] School of Art.\n\n===East Campus===\n{{Main|East Campus (Western Michigan University)}}\n\nEast Campus is the original development dating from the university's founding in 1903. It contains many of the university's historical buildings including, East Hall, West Hall, North Hall, Walwood Hall, Spindler Hall, Vandercook Hall, and The Little Theater. Many of these buildings are on a hill overlooking the city of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. Walwood Hall, renovated in 1992, is home to the Graduate College, the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Medieval Institute, the WMU Office of Research and several other academic and administrative offices.\n\nIn December 2012, WMU announced plans to renovate its birthplace, historic East Hall, for use as an alumni center. It also announced plans to demolish several of the university's original historic buildings and utilize the hilltop as green space.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ursula Zerilli |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/12/east_hall_to_undergo_15_millio.html |title=WMU's East Hall to undergo renovation for alumni center; 3 surrounding historic buildings to be demolished |publisher=MLive.com |date=December 10, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2013|December}}, both West Hall and the Speech and Hearing building that were on East Campus had been demolished.

A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery. However, this also generated controversy and protests among students and faculty because of its aesthetic characteristics and costs. One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each item on the plaza.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michigan Set your local edition &raquo; |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/news-25/1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |title=Michigan |publisher=Mlive.com |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222041300/http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-25%2F1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Fraternities and sororities ===\nSome of the fraternities established on campus include [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], [[Alpha Eta Rho]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Omega Delta Epsilon]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Phi Chi Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], [[Phi Sigma Pi]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Omega Delta Phi]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] .\n\nSome of the sororities established on WMU's campus are, [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Delta Xi Nu]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]] and [[Zeta Phi Beta]].\n\n=== Health services ===\nWestern Michigan University students and faculty are served by Sindecuse Health Center.

Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school's location on August 28, 1903.  Other locations considered included [[Allegan, Michigan|Allegan]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Decatur, Michigan|Decatur]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], and [[Hastings, Michigan|Hastings]].  The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as East Hall, was constructed in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/1903/1903CampusDesign.htm |title=1903 Campus Plan &#124; Campus Planning &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University was first officially known as '''Western State Normal School''', and originally offered a two-year training program.  The first principal and president was [[Dwight B. Waldo]], who served from 1904 until 1936.  The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with '''Western State Teachers College''' in 1927, '''Michigan College of Education''' in 1941, and '''Western Michigan College''' in 1955. On February 26, 1957, Governor [[G. Mennen Williams]] signed a bill into law that made Western Michigan College the state's fourth public university and gave the school its current name of '''Western Michigan University'''.\n\nMost of the oldest and original WMU buildings and \"classrooms\" are collectively known as [[East Campus (Western Michigan University)|East Campus]], directly East from the more central \"West Campus\".\n\nAccess to the East Campus site was an issue because of the steep grade elevating it above the city. The [[Western State Normal Railroad]] was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill via a [[funicular]]. It operated until 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/Specialties/TrolleyCommemoration.htm |title=Western Trolley Commemoration &#124; Photos Images Trivia &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nWMU's campuses encompass more than {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} and roughly 150 buildings.

Many of the [[residence halls]] are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other [[dormitories]] (affectionately referred to as \"The Valleys\") are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley.\n\nThe Bernhard Center is a centrally located multi-purpose student union that provides student and community groups with meeting space. Located within the Bernhard Center is the Bronco Mall, a one-stop-shop for students which includes a large 24-hour computer lab, a [[food court]] featuring [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Biggby Coffee]], [[K-zoo Coney]], numerous tables and chairs for eating and socializing, a [[PNC Bank]], and one of two school [[bookstore]]s.  Waldo Library and the attached University Computing Center are on West Campus, as is the Dalton Musical Center. Recently constructed buildings on West Campus include the Western Heights [[dormitory]] and the Chemistry Building, which replaces aging McCracken Hall.\n\nWest Campus is also the site of [[Miller Auditorium]]. A large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people, it is Michigan's fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular [[musicals]] and [[concerts]] to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex, featuring three performance stages and faculty offices, is directly next to Miller Auditorium. The [[Richmond Center for Visual Arts]] was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into the Kohrman Hall Studios in 2008. Both buildings house the [[Gwen Frostic]] School of Art.\n\n===East Campus===\n{{Main|East Campus (Western Michigan University)}}\n\nEast Campus is the original development dating from the university's founding in 1903.

Many of these buildings are on a hill overlooking the city of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. Walwood Hall, renovated in 1992, is home to the Graduate College, the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Medieval Institute, the WMU Office of Research and several other academic and administrative offices.\n\nIn December 2012, WMU announced plans to renovate its birthplace, historic East Hall, for use as an alumni center.

Predominantly composed during [[Roxette]]'s \"[[Join the Joyride!

Predominantly composed during [[Roxette]]'s \"[[Join the Joyride! Tour]]\", the album contains some of Fredriksson's darkest lyrical content. \"S\u00e5 l\u00e4nge det lyser mittemot\" ({{lang-en|\"As Long as There Is Light on the Other Side\"}}) and \"Mellan sommar och h\u00f6st\" ({{lang-en|\"Between Summer and Autumn\"}}) were issued as [[Single (music)|singles]]. The latter song, along with \"S\u00e5 stilla s\u00e5 l\u00e5ngsamt\" ({{lang-en|\"So Still, So Slow\"}}) and \"Det regnar igen\" ({{lang-en|\"It's Raining Again\"}}), were also top ten hits on the [[Svensktoppen|Swedish Airplay Chart]]. \n\nThe album remains both her highest-selling and most critically successful release in her native country. It spent two weeks atop the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish Albums Chart]], where it was certified platinum within a month of release. As of 2002, the record sold over 185,000 copies in Sweden alone, and remains her only studio album to chart outside of Sweden, peaking within the top twenty of the [[VG-lista|Norwegian Albums Chart]]. The success the record achieved in Scandinavia led EMI to release it internationally; it was issued throughout Europe, as well as in Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\n==Background==\nMarie Fredriksson began her musical career as keyboardist and co-lead vocalist of Swedish [[punk rock]] group [[:sv:Strul (musikgrupp)|Strul]] ({{lang-en|'Trivial' or 'Insignificant'}}), who released their first and only single in 1981 before disbanding the following year. Strul's only permanent members \u2013 Fredriksson and her then-boyfriend Martin Sternhufvud \u2013 went on to form [[power pop]] band MaMas Barn alongside [[Gyllene Tider]] bassist Anders Herrlin and drummer Micke \"Syd\" Andersson. The latter band issued their only album in 1982, ''Barn som barn'' ({{lang-en|italic=yes|Children as Children}}), which struggled commercially. Fredriksson then embarked upon a career as a solo artist, releasing ''[[Het vind]]'' ({{lang-en|italic=yes|Hot Wind}}) in 1984, ''[[Den sjunde v\u00e5gen]]'' ({{lang-en|italic=yes|The Seventh Wave}}) in 1986, and ''[[Efter stormen]]'' ({{lang-en|italic=yes|After the Storm}}) in 1987, all of which were recorded with Gyllene Tider [[Record producer|producer]] Lars-G\u00f6ran \"Lasse\" Lindbom. In 1986, Fredriksson formed [[Pop music|pop]] [[pop duo|duo]] [[Roxette]] alongside Gyllene Tider vocalist [[Per Gessle]].<ref name=\"look\">{{cite book |last=Thorselius|first=Robert |title=The Look for Roxette: The Illustrated Worldwide Discography & Price Guide|edition=1st|date=May 2003|publisher=Premium F\u00f6rlag Publishing |location=Sweden|isbn=978-9197189484}}</ref> Roxette experienced an international breakthrough with albums ''[[Look Sharp!

It was written on a plane, flying to New York from some place I don't remember. After it was written, I presented the lyric to one of my best friends, who said, 'You can't play this. You can't sing about this. Because people might think that you will commit suicide.' So I was scared to release it. It was horrible to get that reaction. But when I look back and read the lyric, I realise it has an important message: it's possible to overcome those feelings.\"<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> \"S\u00e5 l\u00e4nge det lyser mittemot\" was written when Fredriksson returned to her Stockholm apartment after a prolonged period of touring. She explained: \"I had been travelling a lot, for maybe three or four months, and I felt so alone when I came back to a dusty, empty apartment. It's really depressing, to realise no-one has been in your home since you left it. I felt such a coldness. Then I sat on my couch and looked out the window at my neighbour's garden, which looked beautiful while the sun was shining. I felt then that I wasn't completely alone. It was a strange, comforting thought.\"<ref name=\"Documentary\"/> \"Ett enda liv\" was inspired by the suicide of one of Fredriksson's childhood friends.<ref name=\"look\"/>\n\nAlbum closer \"Till sist\" was written by Fredriksson in dedication to her future husband, [[Mikael Bolyos|Mikael \"Micke\" Bolyos]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.expressen.se/kvp/noje/fredriksson-i-tarar-efter-cancer-stodet/ |title=Fredriksson i t\u00e5rar efter cancer-st\u00f6det {{!}} N\u00f6je KvP {{!}} Kv\u00e4llsposten |author=H\u00e4gred, Per |work=[[Expressen]] |publisher=[[Bonnier Group]] |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |language=Swedish |trans-title=\"Fredriksson in tears after cancer support\" |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219134250/https://www.expressen.se/kvp/noje/fredriksson-i-tarar-efter-cancer-stodet/ |archive-date=19 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> whom she met while touring Australia during \"Join the Joyride!\".

I was hanging out in bars, drinking too much. I was sad a lot of the time and had a hard time with the press, when I always had to be nice and say the right things, always having to be available to everybody, always putting on a smile and being happy.

Republican Abraham Lincoln won the county in his landmark 1860 election, and from then until the Great Depression Macon County became solidly Republican, only giving a narrow plurality to [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1912 when the GOP was mortally divided by Theodore Roosevelt's splinter\u2013party run.\n\nThe FDR-era [[New Deal]] saw the county turn Democratic again due to its strong industrial base, although Macon was a perfect [[bellwether]] between 1932 and 1996 apart from the Catholicism-influenced 1960 election and the 1988 election heavily influenced by [[1988\u201389 North American drought|a major Midwestern drought]]. [[Al Gore]] did narrowly hold the county in 2000 despite losing the election due to [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|a razor-thin loss in Florida]], but since then the county has trended Republican. Illinois-bred [[Barack Obama]] did win Macon County in his 2008 triumph, but was convincingly defeated by [[Mitt Romney]] in 2012, whilst in 2016 Hillary Clinton suffered the worst Democratic loss since [[George McGovern]].\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

A period of relative free trade that began with independence in the 1810s brought a modernizing development of certain sectors of the Chilean economy. This was accompanied by formation of a local business class, a novelty in Chile. Chile experienced its first modern economic crisis with the [[Long depression]] in the 1870s. The exploitation of lucrative nitrate deposits of the north conquered in [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131884) marked a whole epoch in the history of Chile and the economic legacy of nitrate has been widely debated.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century Chile suffered severe economic recessions including the [[Great Depression in Chile|Great Depression]]. This period saw the rapid [[urbanization]] of the country, and a [[CORFO|state-led partial industrialization]] that began in 1939. [[porphyry copper deposit|Large-scale]] [[mining in Chile|copper mining]] replaced nitrate extraction as the country's main source of wealth. [[agriculture in Chile|Chilean agriculture]] remained one of the most undeveloped sectors of economy and was stagnant, despite [[Chilean land reform|land reforms in the 1960s and 1970s]], from 1930 to 1980.\n\nIn the mid-1970s under the influence of the [[Chicago Boys]], [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Pinochet's military dictatorship]] initiated profound changes oriented to a [[neoliberalism|\"neoliberal\" economic model]]. The democratic governments that succeeded the dictatorship since 1990 have largely continued its economic policies, but increased social spending and reduced poverty. Chilean exports and [[GDP per capita]] rose steadily through the 1980s and 1990s until the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian crisis of 1997]] after which economic growth slowed somewhat. In the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat|post-1973]] period there has been a rise in [[outsourcing]], [[self-employment]], [[Informal sector|informal employment]] and an increase in women's share in the [[labor force]].<ref name=salazarpinto184>Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 184\u2013187.</ref>\n\n== Pre-Hispanic economy ==\nIn the [[Norte Grande|Far North]] the Pre-Hispanic economy of indigenous groups were divided among those that practised agriculture and were sedentary and the [[Changos]] that lived as coastal [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

Spanish colonizers used large amounts of indigenous labour following the slave labour system used in the [[sugar cane]] plantations of the [[Mediterranean islands]] and [[Macaronesia]]. This system of labour successively killed the production base leading to the imposition of the [[encomienda]] system by the Spanish Crown in order to prevent excesses. In Chile Spanish settlers managed to continue to exploit indigenous labour under slave like conditions despite the implementation of the encomienda. Rich Spanish settlers had over time to face opposition to their mode of production by [[Jesuit]]s, Spanish officials and indigenous [[Mapuche]]s.<ref name=GZ23-25>Salazar 1985, pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n[[File:Pedro De Valdivia Siedlungen in Chile 1540 bis 1553.jpg|thumb|right|120px|All mainland Spanish settlements (red dots) south of [[Biob\u00edo River]] were [[Destruction of the Seven Cities|destroyed by 1604]].]]\nThe initial Spanish settlers of [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]] (conquered in 1567<ref name=hanisch>{{Citation\n| last1  = Hanisch\n| first1 = Walter\n|authorlink=Walter Hanisch\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title     = La Isla de Chilo\u00e9\n| publisher = Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedag\u00f3gicas de Santiago\n| place     = \n| volume  = \n| edition = \n| year    = 1982\n| pages   = 11\u201312}}</ref>) attempted to base their economy on [[gold mining|gold extraction]] and a \"hispanic-mediterranean\" agricultural model.

The first, from 1973 to the [[Crisis of 1982]], corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. During that first period, an economic policy that emphasized export expansion was implemented. Some economists argue that the economic recovery of the second period, from 1982 to 1990, was due to Pinochet's nationalisation of banks and reintroduction to the private market in 1984.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

The military junta appointed a group of Chilean [[Economics|economists]] who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. The [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende,<ref name=\"K.

In a [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]], Chile was drastically transformed from an economy with a protected market, with strong government intervention, into a liberalized, world-integrated economy, where market forces were left free to guide most of the economy's decisions.<ref name=\"K.

Businesses and [[Chilean land reform|lands expropriated]] during the presidency of Allende\nwere re-privatized (with the exception of the copper mines). Price controls were abolished, import liberalized, the financial market and capital flows were [[deregulation|deregulated]]. Labor unions were suppressed.

Chilean economist [[Ricardo Ffrench-Davis]] counters that the cause for those bankruptcies cannot necessarily be addressed to outright inefficiencies since the severe recessions (around 1973, 1975 and 1981), real interest rates at an average of 38%, hasty import liberalization and an artificially high exchange rate revaluation were the decisive factors of business mortality.<ref>Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, Economic Reforms in Chile: From Dictatorship to Democracy, University of Michigan Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-472-11232-6}}, p. 15</ref>\n\nAfter the recession of 1975 the economy expanded from 1977 to 1980 with high growth rates.

The Chicago Boys had expected that since the government had achieved a fiscal surplus and the decision for external borrowing was left to private agents a foreign exchange crises would not occur. But in an effort to fight inflation [[Dollarization]] was introduced which lead to a Peso revaluation that caused high current account deficits which led to an increase in foreign lending. Additionally [[capital controls]] were abandoned and the financial market deregulated which led to an undamped increase in private foreign borrowing.<ref>Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, Economic Reforms in Chile: From Dictatorship to Democracy, University of Michigan Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-472-11232-6}}, p. 10</ref> The debt crises led to a [[bank run]] which led to an economic crises.\n\nWith the economic crisis of 1982, the \"monetarist experiment\" came to be widely regarded as a failure.<ref>Carlos Fortin: The Failure of Repressive Monetarism: Chile, 1973\u201383.

The exploitation of lucrative nitrate deposits of the north conquered in [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131884) marked a whole epoch in the history of Chile and the economic legacy of nitrate has been widely debated.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century Chile suffered severe economic recessions including the [[Great Depression in Chile|Great Depression]]. This period saw the rapid [[urbanization]] of the country, and a [[CORFO|state-led partial industrialization]] that began in 1939. [[porphyry copper deposit|Large-scale]] [[mining in Chile|copper mining]] replaced nitrate extraction as the country's main source of wealth. [[agriculture in Chile|Chilean agriculture]] remained one of the most undeveloped sectors of economy and was stagnant, despite [[Chilean land reform|land reforms in the 1960s and 1970s]], from 1930 to 1980.\n\nIn the mid-1970s under the influence of the [[Chicago Boys]], [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Pinochet's military dictatorship]] initiated profound changes oriented to a [[neoliberalism|\"neoliberal\" economic model]]. The democratic governments that succeeded the dictatorship since 1990 have largely continued its economic policies, but increased social spending and reduced poverty. Chilean exports and [[GDP per capita]] rose steadily through the 1980s and 1990s until the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian crisis of 1997]] after which economic growth slowed somewhat. In the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat|post-1973]] period there has been a rise in [[outsourcing]], [[self-employment]], [[Informal sector|informal employment]] and an increase in women's share in the [[labor force]].<ref name=salazarpinto184>Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 184\u2013187.</ref>\n\n== Pre-Hispanic economy ==\nIn the [[Norte Grande|Far North]] the Pre-Hispanic economy of indigenous groups were divided among those that practised agriculture and were sedentary and the [[Changos]] that lived as coastal [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

Spanish colonizers used large amounts of indigenous labour following the slave labour system used in the [[sugar cane]] plantations of the [[Mediterranean islands]] and [[Macaronesia]]. This system of labour successively killed the production base leading to the imposition of the [[encomienda]] system by the Spanish Crown in order to prevent excesses. In Chile Spanish settlers managed to continue to exploit indigenous labour under slave like conditions despite the implementation of the encomienda.

The first, from 1973 to the [[Crisis of 1982]], corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. During that first period, an economic policy that emphasized export expansion was implemented. Some economists argue that the economic recovery of the second period, from 1982 to 1990, was due to Pinochet's nationalisation of banks and reintroduction to the private market in 1984.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

The film stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Jane Alexander]] and [[Justin Henry]].\nIt tells the story of a couple's [[divorce]], its impact on their young son, and the subsequent evolution of their relationship and views on parenting. \n\nThe film explores the psychology and fallout of divorce and touches upon prevailing or emerging social issues such as [[Gender_role#Changing_roles|gender roles]], [[women's rights]], [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights]], [[work\u2013life balance]], and [[Single_parent#Impact_on_parents|single parents]].\n\n''Kramer vs. Kramer'' was theatrically released on December 19, 1979, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was a major critical and commercial success, grossing $106.3 million on an $8 million budget, becoming the [[1979 in film|highest-grossing film of 1979]] and receiving a leading nine [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[52nd Academy Awards]], winning five: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Hoffman), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Streep), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nTed Kramer ([[Dustin Hoffman]]) is a [[workaholic]] [[advertising]] executive who has just been assigned a new and very important account. Ted arrives home and shares the good news with his wife Joanna ([[Meryl Streep]]) only to find that she is leaving him. She leaves Ted to raise their son Billy ([[Justin Henry]]) by himself. Ted and Billy initially resent one another as Ted no longer has time to carry his increased workload, and Billy misses his mother's love and attention. After months of unrest, Ted and Billy learn to cope and gradually bond as father and son.\n\nTed befriends his neighbor Margaret ([[Jane Alexander]]), who had initially counseled Joanna to leave Ted if she was that unhappy. Margaret is a fellow single parent, and she and Ted become kindred spirits. One day, as the two sit in the park watching their children play, Billy falls off the [[jungle gym]], severely cutting his face. Ted sprints several blocks through oncoming traffic carrying Billy to the hospital, where he comforts his son during treatment.\n\nFifteen months after she walked out, Joanna returns to New York to claim Billy, and a [[child custody|custody battle]] ensues. During the custody hearing, both Ted and Joanna are unprepared for the brutal [[character assassination]]s that their lawyers unleash on the other.

The film stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Jane Alexander]] and [[Justin Henry]].\nIt tells the story of a couple's [[divorce]], its impact on their young son, and the subsequent evolution of their relationship and views on parenting. \n\nThe film explores the psychology and fallout of divorce and touches upon prevailing or emerging social issues such as [[Gender_role#Changing_roles|gender roles]], [[women's rights]], [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights]], [[work\u2013life balance]], and [[Single_parent#Impact_on_parents|single parents]].\n\n''Kramer vs. Kramer'' was theatrically released on December 19, 1979, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was a major critical and commercial success, grossing $106.3 million on an $8 million budget, becoming the [[1979 in film|highest-grossing film of 1979]] and receiving a leading nine [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[52nd Academy Awards]], winning five: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Hoffman), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Streep), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nTed Kramer ([[Dustin Hoffman]]) is a [[workaholic]] [[advertising]] executive who has just been assigned a new and very important account. Ted arrives home and shares the good news with his wife Joanna ([[Meryl Streep]]) only to find that she is leaving him. She leaves Ted to raise their son Billy ([[Justin Henry]]) by himself. Ted and Billy initially resent one another as Ted no longer has time to carry his increased workload, and Billy misses his mother's love and attention. After months of unrest, Ted and Billy learn to cope and gradually bond as father and son.\n\nTed befriends his neighbor Margaret ([[Jane Alexander]]), who had initially counseled Joanna to leave Ted if she was that unhappy. Margaret is a fellow single parent, and she and Ted become kindred spirits. One day, as the two sit in the park watching their children play, Billy falls off the [[jungle gym]], severely cutting his face. Ted sprints several blocks through oncoming traffic carrying Billy to the hospital, where he comforts his son during treatment.\n\nFifteen months after she walked out, Joanna returns to New York to claim Billy, and a [[child custody|custody battle]] ensues. During the custody hearing, both Ted and Joanna are unprepared for the brutal [[character assassination]]s that their lawyers unleash on the other. Margaret is forced to testify that she had advised an unhappy Joanna to leave Ted, though she also attempts to tell Joanna on the stand that her husband has profoundly changed. Eventually, the damaging facts that Ted was fired because of his conflicting parental responsibilities which forced him to take a lower-paying job come out in court, as do the details of Billy's accident.<ref name=\"kkscript\"/> His original salary was noted as \"$33,000 a year\", whereas he was forced to admit that his new salary was only \"$28,200\", after Joanna has told the court that her \"present salary\" as a sportswear designer is \"$31,000 a year\".<ref name=\"kkscript\">{{cite web|title=Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) Movie Script|url=https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=kramer-vs-kramer|website=Springfield!

Devastated with the decision, Ted discusses appealing the case, but his lawyer warns that Billy himself would have to take the stand in the resulting trial. Ted cannot bear the thought of submitting his child to such an ordeal, and decides not to contest custody.\n\nOn the morning that Billy is to move in with Joanna, Ted and Billy make breakfast together, mirroring the meal that Ted tried to cook the first morning after Joanna left. They share a tender hug, knowing that this is their last daily breakfast together. Joanna calls on the intercom, asking Ted to come down to the lobby alone. When he arrives she tells Ted how much she loves and wants Billy, but she knows that his true home is with Ted, and therefore will not take custody of him.
