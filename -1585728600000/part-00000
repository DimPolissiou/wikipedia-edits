The [[Television series|series]] was based on work of the men and women of the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Sydney Water Police]] who fight crime around [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and surrounding locales. The show was set on and around [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]] in Sydney Harbour.\n\n''Water Rats'' premiered on 12 February 1996, and ran for six seasons and 177 episodes. [[Colin Friels]] and [[Catherine McClements]] were the original stars of the series and were instrumental in the show's early success. They both departed the show in 1999. In later seasons, [[Steve Bisley]], [[Aaron Pedersen]] and [[Dee Smart]] became the show's main stars.\n\nFor the sixth and final season in 2001, the show concentrated more on the cops' personal lives rather than just focusing on the crimes committed. The Nine Network cancelled the show after six seasons. Executive Producer [[Kris Noble]] blamed escalating costs for the cancellation. However, Bisley and Smart had also just quit the show, and the series had already been suffering a ratings battle following the departure of Friels and McClements in 1999.\n\nThe final episode was broadcast in Australia on 7 August 2001.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Water Rats characters}}\n\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Det Snr Constable [[Frank Holloway]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Catherine McClements]] as Det Snr Constable [[Rachel Goldstein]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Steve Bisley]] as Det Sergeant [[Jack Christey]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Jay Laga'aia]] as Snr Const [[Tommy Tavita]] (1996\u20132000)\n* [[Aaron Pedersen]] as Det Constable [[Michael Reilly (character)|Michael Reilly]] (1999\u20132001)\n* [[Dee Smart]] as Det Snr Constable [[Alex St. Clare]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* [[Peter Bensley]] as Snr Sgt/Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Jeff Hawker|Jeff Hawker]] (1996\u20132001)\n* Bill Young as Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Clarke Webb|Clarke Webb]] (1996 only)\n* Brett Partridge as Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Gavin Sykes|Gavin Sykes]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Toni Scanlan]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Helen Blakemore|Helen Blakemore]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Scott Burgess (actor)|Scott Burgess]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Dave McCall|Dave McCall]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Aaron Jeffery]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Terry Watson|Terry Watson]] (1996\u20131998)\n* [[Sophie Heathcote]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Fiona Cassidy|Fiona Cassidy]] (1996\u20131997)\n* [[Raelee Hill]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tayler Johnson|Tayler Johnson]] (1997\u20131999)\n* [[Allison Cratchley]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Emma Woods|Emma Woods]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Diarmid Heidenreich]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Matthew Quinn|Matthew Quinn]] (2000\u20132001)\n* [[Rebecca Smart]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Donna Janevski|Donna Janevski]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n=== Recurring roles ===\n\n* [[Peter Mochrie]] as Detective Snr Sergeant [[List of Water Rats Characters#John \"Knocker\" Harrison|John Harrison]] (22 episodes, 1996)\n* [[Jeremy Callaghan]] as Detective Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Kevin Holloway|Kevin Holloway]] (10 episodes, 1996)\n* Richard Healy as Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tony Brady|Tony Brady]] (14 episodes, 1996\u20131997)\n* Treffyn Koreshoff as [[List of Water Rats Characters#David Goldstein|David Goldstein]] (17 episodes, 1996\u20131999)\n* John Walton as [[List of Water Rats Characters#John Walton|John Walton]] (26 episodes, 1997\u20131999)\n* Anthony Martin as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis|Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis]] (44 episodes, 1997\u20132001)\n* [[Mouche Phillips]] as [[List of Water Rats characters#Eva Minton|Eva Minton]] (8 episodes, 2000\u20132001) \n* [[Brooke Satchwell]] as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Sophie Ferguson|Sophie Ferguson]] (20 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n* Joss McWilliam as Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Lance Rorke|Lance Rorke]] (29 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n\n==Season summaries==\n\n===Pilot===\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Water Rats: Dead in the Water\n| image          = \n| image size     =\n| caption        = \n| director       = [[Tim Burstall]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = [[Tony Morphett]]\n| based on = \n| narrator       =\n| starring       =\n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = 12 February 1996\n| runtime        = 90 mins\n| country        = Australia\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross = \n| preceded by    =\n| followed by    =\n}}\nThe first episode of ''Water Rats'' screened in Australia at 8.30&nbsp;pm on Monday, 12 February 1996.

The [[Television series|series]] was based on work of the men and women of the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Sydney Water Police]] who fight crime around [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and surrounding locales. The show was set on and around [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]] in Sydney Harbour.\n\n''Water Rats'' premiered on 12 February 1996, and ran for six seasons and 177 episodes. [[Colin Friels]] and [[Catherine McClements]] were the original stars of the series and were instrumental in the show's early success. They both departed the show in 1999. In later seasons, [[Steve Bisley]], [[Aaron Pedersen]] and [[Dee Smart]] became the show's main stars.\n\nFor the sixth and final season in 2001, the show concentrated more on the cops' personal lives rather than just focusing on the crimes committed. The Nine Network cancelled the show after six seasons. Executive Producer [[Kris Noble]] blamed escalating costs for the cancellation. However, Bisley and Smart had also just quit the show, and the series had already been suffering a ratings battle following the departure of Friels and McClements in 1999.\n\nThe final episode was broadcast in Australia on 7 August 2001.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Water Rats characters}}\n\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Det Snr Constable [[Frank Holloway]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Catherine McClements]] as Det Snr Constable [[Rachel Goldstein]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Steve Bisley]] as Det Sergeant [[Jack Christey]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Jay Laga'aia]] as Snr Const [[Tommy Tavita]] (1996\u20132000)\n* [[Aaron Pedersen]] as Det Constable [[Michael Reilly (character)|Michael Reilly]] (1999\u20132001)\n* [[Dee Smart]] as Det Snr Constable [[Alex St. Clare]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* [[Peter Bensley]] as Snr Sgt/Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Jeff Hawker|Jeff Hawker]] (1996\u20132001)\n* Bill Young as Chief Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Clarke Webb|Clarke Webb]] (1996 only)\n* Brett Partridge as Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Gavin Sykes|Gavin Sykes]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Toni Scanlan]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Helen Blakemore|Helen Blakemore]] (1996\u20132001)\n* [[Scott Burgess (actor)|Scott Burgess]] as Snr Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Dave McCall|Dave McCall]] (1996\u20131999)\n* [[Aaron Jeffery]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Terry Watson|Terry Watson]] (1996\u20131998)\n* [[Sophie Heathcote]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Fiona Cassidy|Fiona Cassidy]] (1996\u20131997)\n* [[Raelee Hill]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tayler Johnson|Tayler Johnson]] (1997\u20131999)\n* [[Allison Cratchley]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Emma Woods|Emma Woods]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Diarmid Heidenreich]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Matthew Quinn|Matthew Quinn]] (2000\u20132001)\n* [[Rebecca Smart]] as Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Donna Janevski|Donna Janevski]] (2000\u20132001)\n\n=== Recurring roles ===\n\n* [[Peter Mochrie]] as Detective Snr Sergeant [[List of Water Rats Characters#John \"Knocker\" Harrison|John Harrison]] (22 episodes, 1996)\n* [[Jeremy Callaghan]] as Detective Snr Constable [[List of Water Rats Characters#Kevin Holloway|Kevin Holloway]] (10 episodes, 1996)\n* Richard Healy as Insp [[List of Water Rats Characters#Tony Brady|Tony Brady]] (14 episodes, 1996\u20131997)\n* Treffyn Koreshoff as [[List of Water Rats Characters#David Goldstein|David Goldstein]] (17 episodes, 1996\u20131999)\n* John Walton as [[List of Water Rats Characters#John Walton|John Walton]] (26 episodes, 1997\u20131999)\n* Anthony Martin as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis|Colin \"Chopper\" Lewis]] (44 episodes, 1997\u20132001)\n* [[Mouche Phillips]] as [[List of Water Rats characters#Eva Minton|Eva Minton]] (8 episodes, 2000\u20132001) \n* [[Brooke Satchwell]] as [[List of Water Rats Characters#Sophie Ferguson|Sophie Ferguson]] (20 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n* Joss McWilliam as Sgt [[List of Water Rats Characters#Lance Rorke|Lance Rorke]] (29 episodes, 2000\u20132001)\n\n==Season summaries==\n\n===Pilot===\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Water Rats: Dead in the Water\n| image          = \n| image size     =\n| caption        = \n| director       = [[Tim Burstall]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = [[Tony Morphett]]\n| based on = \n| narrator       =\n| starring       =\n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = 12 February 1996\n| runtime        = 90 mins\n| country        = Australia\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross = \n| preceded by    =\n| followed by    =\n}}\nThe first episode of ''Water Rats'' screened in Australia at 8.30&nbsp;pm on Monday, 12 February 1996.

It was released as two parts called Series 1 and Series 2, though it was actually only season 1 in two parts. Warner Vision Australia then released the rest of the show, where DVDs labelled series 3 were actually season 2 and so on. It was announced on 7 August 2017 that Via Vision Entertainment would re-release all six seasons on DVD on 22 November 2017. Several episodes are out of broadcast order in the Via Vision collection.\n\n=== DVDs ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! Format \n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}} of<br />episodes\n! Discs\n!

Neither language is related to Andamanese.\n\n===Chola empire period===\n[[Rajendra Chola I]] (1014 to 1042 AD), used the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a strategic naval base to launch an expedition against the [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya Empire]] (modern-day Indonesia). The [[Cholas]] called the island Ma-Nakkavaram (\"great open/naked land\"), found in the [[Thanjavur]] inscription of 1050 AD.

Two years later the colony was moved to [[Port Cornwallis]] on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.\n\n[[Denmark]]'s presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,<ref name=\"ColVoy\"/> which made them part of [[British India]] in 1869.\n\nIn 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The primary purpose was to set up a [[penal colony]] for criminal convicts from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The colony came to include the infamous [[Cellular Jail]].\n\nIn 1872 the Andaman and Nicobar islands were united under a single chief commissioner at [[Port Blair]].\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands}}\nDuring [[World War II]], the islands were practically under Japanese control, only nominally under the authority of the [[Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind]] of [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as \"Shaheed-dweep\" (Martyr Island) and \"Swaraj-dweep\" (Self-rule Island).\n\nGeneral [[A. D. Loganathan|Loganathan]], of the [[Indian National Army]], was made the Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On 22 February 1944 he along with four INA officers\u2014Major Mansoor Ali Alvi, Sub. Lt. Md. Iqbal, Lt. Suba Singh and stenographer Srinivasan\u2014arrived at Lambaline Airport in [[Port Blair]].

The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. The islands may have been a waystation on the way to their temporary settlement of [[Rutland Island]] between 1890 and 1930.\n\nThe islands have been designated as a [[wildlife refuge]] since 1987, with an area of {{convert|0.36|km2}}.\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].<ref name=\"soup\">R.

Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].\n\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.<ref>India Year Book 2015</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{India census population\n|title= Population growth\n|1951= 30971\n|1961= 63548\n|1971= 115133\n|1981= 188741\n|1991= 280661\n|2001= 356152\n|2011= 380581\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>\n|1901=24649|1911=26459|1921=27086|1931=29463|1941=33768}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female.

The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. The islands may have been a waystation on the way to their temporary settlement of [[Rutland Island]] between 1890 and 1930.\n\nThe islands have been designated as a [[wildlife refuge]] since 1987, with an area of {{convert|0.36|km2}}.\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].<ref name=\"soup\">R. Sankaran (1999), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704194845/http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}''.

Ten species are endemic to these Islands. [[Mount Harriet National Park]] is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.\n\nThe islands are well known for prized [[shellfish]], especially from the genera ''[[Turbo (genus)|Turbo]]'', ''[[Trochus]]'', ''[[Murex]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]''. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].\n\nThere are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.<ref>India Year Book 2015</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{India census population\n|title= Population growth\n|1951= 30971\n|1961= 63548\n|1971= 115133\n|1981= 188741\n|1991= 280661\n|2001= 356152\n|2011= 380581\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote=Source:Census of India<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>\n|1901=24649|1911=26459|1921=27086|1931=29463|1941=33768}}\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], the population of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 379,944, of which 202,330 (53.25%) were male and 177,614 (46.75%) were female.

Two years later the colony was moved to [[Port Cornwallis]] on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.\n\n[[Denmark]]'s presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,<ref name=\"ColVoy\"/> which made them part of [[British India]] in 1869.\n\nIn 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent.

The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing.

So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group.

Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items.

Two years later the colony was moved to [[Port Cornwallis]] on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.\n\n[[Denmark]]'s presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain,<ref name=\"ColVoy\"/> which made them part of [[British India]] in 1869.\n\nIn 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent.

The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests, and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.\n\nBefore the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing.

So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.\n\nThe South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.\n\nThis atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:\n# Giant [[evergreen forest]]\n# Andamans tropical evergreen forest\n# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]\n# Canebrakes\n# Wet bamboo brakes\n# Andamans semi-evergreen forest\n# Andamans moist deciduous forest\n# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest\n# [[Littoral]] forest\n# [[Mangrove forest]]\n# Brackish water mixed forest\n# Submontane forest\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Ross island - Andaman.jpg|thumb|Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep, Andaman]]\nThis tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent land masses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.\n\nAbout 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna.\n\nAbout 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group.

Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items.
