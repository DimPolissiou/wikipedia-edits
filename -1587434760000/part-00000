Jay|editor-last2=Keyser|pp=53-109|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|ISBN=978-0-262-58124-0}}</ref> which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.\n\n==Nanosyntactic Operations==\nNanosyntax is a theory that seeks to fill in holes left by other theories when they seek to explain phenomena in language. The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation.<ref name=\":1\"/> For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural. In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on two principles: phrasal lexicalisation and the Elsewhere principle.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>. When this principle is applied, we can say that in regular plural nouns, there is no special lexicalisation (denoted in the below example using X) that needs to apply, and so standard pluralisation rules apply. The following is an example using \"duck\" where because there is no additional lexicalisation of the plural noun, an -s is added to pluralise the noun:\n\nX \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK] [ Pl ]]\u2003\nduck \u2194 [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK](8)\u2003s \u2194 Pl\n\nThis principle also allows for a word like \"geese\" to lexicalise [goose[Pl<sup>0</sup>]. When an additional lexicalisation is present, instead of following the standard addition of -s to pluralise the noun, instead the lexicalisation rule takes over in the following manner: \n\ngeese \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> GOOSE] [ Pl ]].\n\n====Elsewhere Principle====\nThe Elsewhere Principle seeks to provide a solution to the question of which lexicalisation applies to the noun in question. In simple terms, the lexicalisation that is more specific will always take precedence over a more general lexicalisation.\n\nAs illustrated, syntactic structure S seeks either lexicalisation from  A \u2194 [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]] or B \u2194 [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]], B will win out over A because B lexicalises in a more specific situation whereas A lexicalises more generally. This solves the problem that distributive morphology faces when determining optimal pluralisation for irregular nouns.\n\n====Observable Consequences====\nCaha proposed that there is a hierarchy in case as follows from broadest to narrowest: Dative, Genetive, Accusative, Nominative<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Caha |first1=Pavel |title=The nanosyntax of case (Ph. D. thesis) |journal=University of Troms\u00f8 |date=2009}}</ref>. Caha also suggested that each of these cases could be broken down into its most basic structures, each of which is a syntactic terminal, as follows:\n\nDative = [<sub>WP</sub> W [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]]\nGenitive = [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]\nAccusative = [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]\nNominative = [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]\n\nThis is further outlined in the Morphological Containment/Nesting portion of this Wikipedia article. \n\nAs each is formed with sets within, it is possible for portions of the tense to be lexicalised by a separate noun. Therefore, there are several possibilities in syncretism patterns, namely AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, AABC, ABBC and ABCC. Some arrangements do not appear as possibilities because of the constraints laid on by the Elsewhere Principle. Notably, once there has been a switch to a separate lexicalisation, the lexicalisations from prior cannot return. In other words, there are no occurrences where once A turns to B or B to C, A or B reappears respectively. The Elsewhere Principle says that narrower lexicalisations win over broader lexicalisations, and once a narrower lexicalisation has been selected for, the broader lexicalisation will not reappear.\n\n==Nanosyntax in Relation to Other Linguistic Aspects==\n\n== Tools of Nanosyntax ==\nNanosyntax uses a handful of tools in order to map out fine-grained elements of the language being analyzed. Beyond Spellout Principles, there are three main tools for this system, who's uses are outlined as such, based of the writings of Baunaz, Haegeman, De Clercq, and Lander in ''Exploring Nanosyntax'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-21|editor-last=Baunaz|editor-first=Lena|editor2-last=Haegeman|editor2-first=Liliane|editor3-last=De Clercq|editor3-first=Karen|editor4-last=Lander|editor4-first=Eric|title=Exploring Nanosyntax|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001}}</ref>\n\n====[[Semantics]]====\nThe universal structure of compositionality is used in order for mapping structure within sentences semantically. This deals with mapping which features words are composed of such as which structures a given word is semantically \"constructed on\". Semantic considerations impact the parameters of structural seize of a sentence, based on semantic categories of things such as verbs. This is an important guiding feature on what elements of syntax need to be aligned with semantic markers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====[[Syncretism (linguistics)|Syncretism]]====\nSyncretism has played a central role in the development of Nanosyntax.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Pantcheva|first=Marina|title=Decomposing Path: The Nanosyntax of Directional Expressions|publisher=University of Tromso|oclc=786337774}}</ref> This system combines two distinct morphosyntactic structures on the surface of a sentence: such as two grammar function that are contained within a single lexical form<ref name=\":2\" />. An example of this could be something such as the french \"\u00e0\" which can be used to indicate a location or a goal; this is therefore a Location-Goal syncretism.<ref name=\":4\"/> This observation of a syncratism comes form work investigating patterns of the readings of words such as goal \"to\", route \"via\", and location \"at\" cross-linguistically preformed by linguistics such as Svenonius.<ref>Svenonius, Peter. 2010. \u201cSpatial Prepositions in English.\u201d In ''Mapping Spatial PPs: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, Vol. 6'', edited by Guglielmo Cinque and Luigi Rizzi, pp. 127\u2013160.

Through using syncretism in Nanosyntax, a universal order of cases can be identified, through determining which cases sit beside one another. This finding allows linguists to understand which features are present, as well as their order.  \n\n==== Morphological Containment/Nesting ====\nMorphological containment relates to the hierarchy of linear order in syntactic structures. Syncretism may reveals linear oder, but is unable to determine in which direction the linear order occurs. This is where morphological containment is required. It is used in this context to posit the hierarchy of cases. Syncretism can determine the linear order of cases is COM > INS > DAT > GEN > ACC > NOM ''or'' NOM > ACC > GEN > DAT > INS > COM, but morphological containment decides whether it is [[Nominative case|nominative]] or [[Comitative case|comitative]] initial.<ref name=\":0\" /> These case features can be understood as sets of each other, where features build on top of one another, with the first feature being a singleton, but the next feature is the first and second nested within itself- and so on. These sets can be referred to as the above mentioned features. Alternatively, to simplify the nesting of the features, one can label them as  K<sub>1/etc</sub> as proposed by Pavel Caha<ref name=\":2\">{{cite thesis|type=PhD dissertation|title=The Nanosyntax of Case|author=Pavel Caha|date=July 2009|url= https://munin.uit.no/bitstream/handle/10037/2203/thesis.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref>.

Originally referenced in films as '''Creighton Chaney''', he was later credited as \"Lon Chaney, Jr.\" in 1935, and after ''[[Man Made Monster]]'' (1941), beginning as early as ''The Wolf Man'' later that same year, he was almost always billed under his more famous father's name as '''Lon Chaney''' at the studio's insistence. Chaney had [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, and his career in movies and television spanned four decades, from 1931 to 1971.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Lon Chaney, Sr. The Miracle Man.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Lon Chaney]], Creighton's father]]\n\nCreighton was born in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma Territory]], the son of then stage performer [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and Frances Cleveland Creighton Chaney, a singing stage performer who traveled in road shows across the country with Creighton. His parents' troubled marriage ended in divorce in 1913 following his mother's scandalous public [[suicide]] attempt in [[Los Angeles]]. Young Creighton lived in various homes and [[boarding school]]s until 1916, when his father (now employed in the film industry) married Hazel Hastings and could provide a stable home.\n\nFrom an early age, he worked hard to avoid his famous father's shadow. In young adulthood, his father discouraged him from show business, and he attended business college and became successful in a Los Angeles appliance corporation. Creighton, who had begun working for a plumbing company, married Dorothy Hinckley, the daughter of his employer Ralph Hinckley. They had two sons: Lon Ralph Chaney and Ronald Creighton Chaney.\n\nCreighton's life changed forever when his father was diagnosed with throat cancer and died on August 26, 1930, at the age of 47. Many articles and biographies over the years report that Creighton was led to believe his mother had died while he was a boy, and was only made aware she lived after his father's death. Creighton always maintained he had a tough childhood.\n\n==Career==\n===As Creighton Chaney===\nIt was only after his father's death that Chaney began to act in films, billed by his own name. He began with an uncredited [[bit part]] in the serial ''[[The Galloping Ghost (serial)|The Galloping Ghost]]'' (1931) and signed a contract with [[RKO]] who gave him small roles in a number of films, including ''[[Girl Crazy (1932 film)|Girl Crazy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Roadhouse Murder]]'' (1932), ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932), and ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932).\n\nRKO gave him the starring role in a serial, ''[[The Last Frontier (serial)|The Last Frontier]]'' (1932). He got bigger film roles in ''[[Lucky Devils (1933 film)|Lucky Devils]]'' (1933), ''[[Son of the Border]]'' (1933), ''[[Scarlet River]]'' (1933), ''[[The Life of Vergie Winters]]'' (1934). Over at [[Mascot Pictures]] he supported [[John Wayne]] in a serial, ''[[The Three Musketeers (1933 serial)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1933), which was later re-edited into a film entitled ''Desert Command'' (1946).\n\n\"I did every possible bit in pictures\" said Chaney later. \"Had to do stuntwork to live. I bulldogged steers, fell off and got knocked off cliffs, rode horses and precipes into rivers, drove prairie schooners up and down hills.\"<ref>FILLER OF FATHER'S FOOTWEAR: FILLER OF FATHER'S FOOTWEAR\nSmith, Frederick James.

The last film he made as Creighton Chaney was ''[[The Marriage Bargain]]'' (1935) for Screencraft Productions. After this point he was billed as Lon Chaney, Jr. until 1942, when he was often billed, at the insistence of [[Universal Studios]], with his iconic father's name, although the \"Jr.\" was usually added by others to distinguish the two.\n\n===As Lon Chaney Jr===\nHe had the lead in ''[[A Scream in the Night]]'' (1935) made for Commodore Pictures, a crime thriller.<ref>Mary Pickford Considers Leading Drive to Produce Pictures in England: British Films Would Use American Actors Cycle of Kipling Stories Looms Both Here and Abroad; Lon Chaney, Jr., Follows in Noted Parent's Footsteps\nSchallert, Edwin.

He was a henchman in a serial for Republic, ''[[Undersea Kingdom]]'' (1936). Universal got him to play a henchman in their serial, ''[[Ace Drummond (serial)|Ace Drummond]]'' (1937) and he was uncredited in Columbia's ''[[Killer at Large (1937 film)|Killer at Large]]'' (1937).

[Los Angeles, Calif]15 Jan 1940: 9.</ref> He was cast in that role in the film ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), which was produced by [[Hal Roach Studios]]. The film was Chaney Jr's first major role in a film and was a critical success for him. Chaney had a screen test for the role of [[Quasimodo]] for the remake of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), but the role went to [[Charles Laughton]].\n\nHal Roach used him in his third-billed character role in ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940) as [[Victor Mature]]'s caveman father, Chaney began to be viewed as a character actor in the mold of his father. He had in fact designed a swarthy, ape-like Neanderthal make-up on himself for the film, but production decisions and union rules prevented his following through on emulating his father in that fashion. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] used him in a supporting role in ''[[North West Mounted Police (film)|North West Mounted Police]]'' (1940) and MGM used him in ''[[Billy the Kid (1941 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1941).

Chaney's first horror film, it was successful enough for them to offer him a long-term contract.\n\nUniversal kept him in supporting roles for a while: a comedy ''[[Too Many Blondes]]'' (1941), a musical ''[[San Antonio Rose (film)|San Antonio Rose]]'' (1941), a serial ''[[Riders of Death Valley]]'' (1941), the Western ''[[Badlands of Dakota]]'' (1941) and the \"Northern\" ''[[North to the Klondike]]'' (1942).\n\n===Horror Film Star: The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Inner Sanctum===\n[[File:TheWolfManLobbyCardCropped.png|thumb|[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]], Chaney's signature role.]]\n[[File:MummysGhost1944Crop002.png|thumb|Chaney appeared as [[The Mummy (franchise)|Kharis the Mummy]] three times between 1942 and 1944.]]\nChaney was then given the title role in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) for Universal, a role which, much like Karloff's [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] monster, would largely [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] Chaney as a horror film actor for the rest of his life.\n\nChaney Jr was now an official horror star, and Universal gave him the role of Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) when Karloff decided not to play the part again. He was in a crime film, ''[[Eyes of the Underworld]]'' (1942) and the wartime shorts  ''[[Keeping Fit]]'' (1942) and ''[[What We Are Fighting For]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney Jr played Kharis the Mummy in ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), another hit. He was in a Western ''[[Frontier Badmen]]'' (1943), then reprised his role as the Wolf Man in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney was given the role of Dracula in ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943). This made him the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major horror characters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, and [[Count Dracula]].\n\nAfter a cameo in ''[[Crazy House (1943 film)|Crazy House]]'' (1943) he was given the lead in ''[[Calling Dr. Death]]'' (1943), based on the [[Inner Sanctum Mystery|Inner Sanctum mysteries]]. It kicked off another series starring Chaney, the first of which was ''[[Weird Woman]]'' (1944).\n\nHe made a second mummy movie, ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' (1944) and had a support part in ''[[Cobra Woman]]'' (1944), starring [[Maria Montez]] and ''[[Ghost Catcher]]'' (1944), with [[Olsen and Johnson]].\n\n''[[Dead Man's Eyes]]'' (1944) was the third Inner Sanctum, after which he was back as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944). ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (1944) was Chaney's third and final appearance as Kharis.\n\nHe had a small role in an [[Abbott and Costello]] comedy ''[[Here Come the Co-Eds]]'' (1945), then made more Inner Sanctums: ''[[The Frozen Ghost]]'' (1945) and ''[[Strange Confession]]'' (1945). He returned as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), one of the last of the Universal horror cycle. ''[[Pillow of Death]]'' (1945) was the last Inner Sanctum. ''[[The Daltons Ride Again]]'' (1945) was a Western.\n\n===Leaving Universal===\nDespite being typecast as the Wolf Man, the 6-foot 2-inch, 220 pound actor managed to carve out a secondary niche as a supporting actor and villain.\n\nHe was in a Bob Hope comedy ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947), supported [[Randolph Scott]] in ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) and had a support in ''[[The Counterfeiters (1948 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' (1948) and played a villain in ''[[16 Fathoms Deep]]'' (1948) for [[Monogram Pictures]], a remake of his 1934 film.\n\nHe reprised his Wolf Man role to great effect in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) but it did not cause a notable boost to his career. In April 1948 Chaney went to hospital after taking an overdose of sleeping pills.<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Takes Too Many Sleeping Pills, Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif.

Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]18 Jan 1949: A7.</ref>\n\nChaney kept busy in support roles: ''[[Captain China]]'' (1950), ''[[Once a Thief (1950 film)|Once a Thief]]'' (1950), ''[[Inside Straight (film)|Inside Straight]]'' (1951), ''[[Bride of the Gorilla]]'' (1951), ''[[Only the Valiant]]'' (1951), ''[[Behave Yourself!]]'' (1951), ''[[Flame of Araby]]'' (1952), ''[[The Bushwackers (film)|The Bushwackers]]'' (1952), ''[[Thief of Damascus]]'' (1952), ''[[Battles of Chief Pontiac]]'' (1952) (in the title role), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Springfield Rifle (film)|Springfield Rifle]]'' (1952), ''[[The Black Castle]]'' (1952) (a return to horror), ''[[Raiders of the Seven Seas]]'' (1953), ''[[A Lion Is in the Streets]]'' (1953), ''[[The Boy from Oklahoma]]'' (1954), ''[[Casanova's Big Night]]'' (1954), ''[[Passion (1954 film)|Passion]]'' (1954), ''[[The Black Pirates]]'' (1954), ''[[Jivaro (film)|Jivaro]]'' (1955), ''[[Big House, U.S.A.]]'' (1955), ''[[I Died a Thousand Times]]'' (1955), ''[[The Indian Fighter]]'' (1955), and ''[[The Black Sleep]]'' (1956)\n\nHe had a leading role in ''[[Indestructible Man]]'' (1956) then was back to support parts: ''[[Manfish]]'' (1956); a [[Martin and Lewis]] comedy, ''[[Pardners]]'' (1956); ''[[Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer]]'' (1957); ''[[The Cyclops (film)|The Cyclops]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Alligator People]]'' (1959).\n\nChaney established himself as a favorite of producer [[Stanley Kramer]]; in addition to playing a key supporting role in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952) (starring [[Gary Cooper]]), he also appeared in ''[[Not as a Stranger]]'' (1955)\u2014a hospital melodrama featuring [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]\u2014and ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]'' (1958, starring [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Sidney Poitier]]). Kramer told the press at the time that whenever a script came in with a role too difficult for most actors in Hollywood, he called Chaney.\n\nOne of his best known roles was a 1952 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717031/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_87 live television version]{{unreliable source|date=April 2019}} of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' on the anthology series ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' for which he allegedly showed up drunk, though that contention is unsubstantiated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/28492/ |title=Film Threat \u2013 The Bootleg Files: Tales Of Tomorrow \u2013 Frankenstein |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> During the live broadcast, Chaney, playing the Monster, apparently thought it was just a rehearsal and he would pick up furniture that he was supposed to break, only to gingerly put it back down while muttering, \"I saved it for you.\" A kinescope of the January 18, 1952 broadcast is available on DVD, [[YouTube]], and also open to the public for viewing at [[The Paley Center for Media]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nHe became quite popular with [[baby boomer]]s after Universal released its back catalog of horror films to television in 1957 (''[[Shock Theater]]'') and ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' magazine regularly focused on his films.\n\nIn 1957, Chaney went to [[Ontario, Canada]], to costar in the first ever American-Canadian television production, as Chingachgook in ''[[Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans]]'', suggested by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s stories. The series ended after 39 episodes. Universal released their film biography of his father, ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957), featuring a semi-fictionalized version of Creighton's life story from his birth up until his father's death. [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] was cast as Creighton as a young adult.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the western series ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'' titled \"The Black Marshal from [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]]\" (1958), and appeared in numerous western series such as ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. He also hosted the 13-episode television [[anthology]] series ''[[13 Demon Street]]'' in 1959, which was created by [[Curt Siodmak]].\n[[File:Dracula vs. Frankenstein Chaney.jpg|thumb|left|Chaney Jr. in ''Dracula vs. Frankenstein'' (1971)]]\n\n===1960s===\nIn the 1960s, Chaney specialised in horror films, such as ''[[House of Terror (1960 film)|House of Terror]]'' (1960), ''[[The Devil's Messenger]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963), replacing [[Boris Karloff]] in the latter for [[Roger Corman]].\n\nHe was in a Western ''[[Law of the Lawless (1963 film)|Law of the Lawless]]'' (1963), ''[[Face of the Screaming Werewolf]]'' (1964), ''[[Witchcraft (1964 film)|Witchcraft]]'' (1964), and ''[[Stage to Thunder Rock]]'' (1964).\n\nHe had one of his best later roles in ''[[Spider Baby]]'', made in 1964 but not released until 1968. Then it was back to Westerns - ''[[Young Fury]]'' (1965), ''[[Black Spurs]]'' (1965), ''[[Town Tamer]]'' (1966), ''[[Johnny Reno]]'' (1967), ''[[Apache Uprising]]'' (1967), ''[[Welcome to Hard Times (film)|Welcome to Hard Times]]'' (1967) and ''[[Buckskin (film)|Buckskin]]'' (1968). There was also horror, such as ''[[Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors]]'' (1967) and ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967).\n\nHis bread-and-butter work during this decade was television \u2013 where he made guest appearances on everything from ''[[Wagon Train]]'' to ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' \u2013 and in a string of supporting roles in low-budget Westerns produced by [[A. C. Lyles]] for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. In 1962, Chaney gained a chance to briefly play Quasimodo in a simulacrum of his father's make-up, as well as return to his roles of the Mummy and the Wolf Man on the television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' with friends [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Peter Lorre]]. During this era, he starred in [[Jack Hill]]'s ''[[Spider Baby]]'' (filmed 1964, released 1968), for which he also sang the title song.\n\n===Final films===\nIn later years, he suffered from [[throat cancer]] and chronic [[heart disease]] among other ailments after decades of heavy drinking and smoking. In his final horror film, ''[[Dracula vs. Frankenstein]]'' (1971), directed by [[Al Adamson]], he played Groton, [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]'s mute henchman. He filmed his part in the spring of 1969, and shortly thereafter performed his final film role, also for Adamson in 1969 in ''[[The Female Bunch]]''.<ref>Weldon, Michael (1983). \"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film\". Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|0-345-34345-X}}. Page 235</ref>  Chaney had lines in ''[[The Female Bunch]]'' but his hoarse, raspy voice was virtually unrecognizable. Due to illness he retired from acting to concentrate on a book about the Chaney family legacy, ''A Century of Chaneys'', which remains to date unpublished in any form. His grandson, [[Ron Chaney]], was working on completing this project.<ref>[http://www.midnightpalace.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=141 Interview with Ron Chaney, including references to Lon's book]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nChaney was married twice. His first wife Dorothy divorced him in 1936 for drinking too much and being \"sullen\".<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Is Sued for Divorce; Wed 10 Years\nChicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963); Chicago, Ill. [Chicago, Ill]26 June 1936: 23.</ref> He remarried in 1937. He had two sons by his first wife, Lon Ralph Chaney (born July 3, 1928) and Ronald Creighton Chaney (born March 18, 1930), both now deceased.\n\nChaney was well liked by some co-workers \u2013 \"sweet\" is the adjective that most commonly emerges from those who acted with, and liked him \u2013 yet he was capable of intense dislikes. For instance, he and frequent co-star [[Evelyn Ankers]] did not get along at all despite their on-camera chemistry. He was also known to befriend younger actors and stand up for older ones who Chaney felt were belittled by the studios. One example was that of [[William Farnum]], a major silent star who played a bit part in ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]''. According to co-star Peter Coe, Chaney demanded that Farnum be given his own chair on the set and be treated with respect, or else he would walk off the picture.\n\nChaney had run-ins with actor [[Frank Reicher]] (whom he nearly strangled on camera in ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'') and director [[Robert Siodmak]] (over whose head Chaney broke a vase).<ref>Smith, Don G., ''Lon Chaney Jr.: Horror Film Star'', McFarland & Co., 1996</ref>\nActor [[Robert Stack]] claimed in his 1980 autobiography that Chaney and drinking buddy [[Broderick Crawford]] were known as \"the monsters\" around the [[Universal Pictures]] lot because of their drunken behavior that frequently resulted in bloodshed.<ref>Stack, Robert, ''Straight Shooting'', Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1980, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Honors===\nIn 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |date=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nChaney died of [[heart failure]] at age 67 on July 12, 1973, in [[San Clemente, California]].<ref>[http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm Cumuseumofterror.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604021624/http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm |date=2008-06-04 }} (Includes Chaney's Death Certificate)</ref> His body was donated for [[medical research]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Lon Chaney Jr., Actor, Is Dead at 67; Portrayed Monsters |quote= Lon Chaney Jr., the film actor, died yesterday at the age of 67.

Originally referenced in films as '''Creighton Chaney''', he was later credited as \"Lon Chaney, Jr.\" in 1935, and after ''[[Man Made Monster]]'' (1941), beginning as early as ''The Wolf Man'' later that same year, he was almost always billed under his more famous father's name as '''Lon Chaney''' at the studio's insistence. Chaney had [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, and his career in movies and television spanned four decades, from 1931 to 1971.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Lon Chaney, Sr. The Miracle Man.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Lon Chaney]], Creighton's father]]\n\nCreighton was born in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma Territory]], the son of then stage performer [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and Frances Cleveland Creighton Chaney, a singing stage performer who traveled in road shows across the country with Creighton. His parents' troubled marriage ended in divorce in 1913 following his mother's scandalous public [[suicide]] attempt in [[Los Angeles]]. Young Creighton lived in various homes and [[boarding school]]s until 1916, when his father (now employed in the film industry) married Hazel Hastings and could provide a stable home.\n\nFrom an early age, he worked hard to avoid his famous father's shadow. In young adulthood, his father discouraged him from show business, and he attended business college and became successful in a Los Angeles appliance corporation. Creighton, who had begun working for a plumbing company, married Dorothy Hinckley, the daughter of his employer Ralph Hinckley. They had two sons: Lon Ralph Chaney and Ronald Creighton Chaney.\n\nCreighton's life changed forever when his father was diagnosed with throat cancer and died on August 26, 1930, at the age of 47. Many articles and biographies over the years report that Creighton was led to believe his mother had died while he was a boy, and was only made aware she lived after his father's death. Creighton always maintained he had a tough childhood.\n\n==Career==\n===As Creighton Chaney===\nIt was only after his father's death that Chaney began to act in films, billed by his own name. He began with an uncredited [[bit part]] in the serial ''[[The Galloping Ghost (serial)|The Galloping Ghost]]'' (1931) and signed a contract with [[RKO]] who gave him small roles in a number of films, including ''[[Girl Crazy (1932 film)|Girl Crazy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Roadhouse Murder]]'' (1932), ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932), and ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932).\n\nRKO gave him the starring role in a serial, ''[[The Last Frontier (serial)|The Last Frontier]]'' (1932). He got bigger film roles in ''[[Lucky Devils (1933 film)|Lucky Devils]]'' (1933), ''[[Son of the Border]]'' (1933), ''[[Scarlet River]]'' (1933), ''[[The Life of Vergie Winters]]'' (1934). Over at [[Mascot Pictures]] he supported [[John Wayne]] in a serial, ''[[The Three Musketeers (1933 serial)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1933), which was later re-edited into a film entitled ''Desert Command'' (1946).\n\n\"I did every possible bit in pictures\" said Chaney later. \"Had to do stuntwork to live. I bulldogged steers, fell off and got knocked off cliffs, rode horses and precipes into rivers, drove prairie schooners up and down hills.\"<ref>FILLER OF FATHER'S FOOTWEAR: FILLER OF FATHER'S FOOTWEAR\nSmith, Frederick James.

The last film he made as Creighton Chaney was ''[[The Marriage Bargain]]'' (1935) for Screencraft Productions. After this point he was billed as Lon Chaney, Jr. until 1942, when he was often billed, at the insistence of [[Universal Studios]], with his iconic father's name, although the \"Jr.\" was usually added by others to distinguish the two.\n\n===As Lon Chaney Jr===\nHe had the lead in ''[[A Scream in the Night]]'' (1935) made for Commodore Pictures, a horror movie.<ref>Mary Pickford Considers Leading Drive to Produce Pictures in England: British Films Would Use American Actors Cycle of Kipling Stories Looms Both Here and Abroad; Lon Chaney, Jr., Follows in Noted Parent's Footsteps\nSchallert, Edwin.

He was a henchman in a serial for Republic, ''[[Undersea Kingdom]]'' (1936). Universal got him to play a henchman in their serial, ''[[Ace Drummond (serial)|Ace Drummond]]'' (1937) and he was uncredited in Columbia's ''[[Killer at Large (1937 film)|Killer at Large]]'' (1937).

[Los Angeles, Calif]15 Jan 1940: 9.</ref> He was cast in that role in the film ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), which was produced by [[Hal Roach Studios]]. The film was Chaney Jr's first major role in a film and was a critical success for him. Chaney had a screen test for the role of [[Quasimodo]] for the remake of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), but the role went to [[Charles Laughton]].\n\nHal Roach used him in his third-billed character role in ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940) as [[Victor Mature]]'s caveman father, Chaney began to be viewed as a character actor in the mold of his father. He had in fact designed a swarthy, ape-like Neanderthal make-up on himself for the film, but production decisions and union rules prevented his following through on emulating his father in that fashion. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] used him in a supporting role in ''[[North West Mounted Police (film)|North West Mounted Police]]'' (1940) and MGM used him in ''[[Billy the Kid (1941 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1941).

Chaney's first horror film, it was successful enough for them to offer him a long-term contract.\n\nUniversal kept him in supporting roles for a while: a comedy ''[[Too Many Blondes]]'' (1941), a musical ''[[San Antonio Rose (film)|San Antonio Rose]]'' (1941), a serial ''[[Riders of Death Valley]]'' (1941), the Western ''[[Badlands of Dakota]]'' (1941) and the \"Northern\" ''[[North to the Klondike]]'' (1942).\n\n===Horror Film Star: The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Inner Sanctum===\n[[File:TheWolfManLobbyCardCropped.png|thumb|[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]], Chaney's signature role.]]\n[[File:MummysGhost1944Crop002.png|thumb|Chaney appeared as [[The Mummy (franchise)|Kharis the Mummy]] three times between 1942 and 1944.]]\nChaney was then given the title role in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) for Universal, a role which, much like Karloff's [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] monster, would largely [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] Chaney as a horror film actor for the rest of his life.\n\nChaney Jr was now an official horror star, and Universal gave him the role of Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) when Karloff decided not to play the part again. He was in a crime film, ''[[Eyes of the Underworld]]'' (1942) and the wartime shorts  ''[[Keeping Fit]]'' (1942) and ''[[What We Are Fighting For]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney Jr played Kharis the Mummy in ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), another hit. He was in a Western ''[[Frontier Badmen]]'' (1943), then reprised his role as the Wolf Man in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney was given the role of Dracula in ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943). This made him the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major horror characters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, and [[Count Dracula]].\n\nAfter a cameo in ''[[Crazy House (1943 film)|Crazy House]]'' (1943) he was given the lead in ''[[Calling Dr. Death]]'' (1943), based on the [[Inner Sanctum Mystery|Inner Sanctum mysteries]]. It kicked off another series starring Chaney, the first of which was ''[[Weird Woman]]'' (1944).\n\nHe made a second mummy movie, ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' (1944) and had a support part in ''[[Cobra Woman]]'' (1944), starring [[Maria Montez]] and ''[[Ghost Catcher]]'' (1944), with [[Olsen and Johnson]].\n\n''[[Dead Man's Eyes]]'' (1944) was the third Inner Sanctum, after which he was back as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944). ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (1944) was Chaney's third and final appearance as Kharis.\n\nHe had a small role in an [[Abbott and Costello]] comedy ''[[Here Come the Co-Eds]]'' (1945), then made more Inner Sanctums: ''[[The Frozen Ghost]]'' (1945) and ''[[Strange Confession]]'' (1945). He returned as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), one of the last of the Universal horror cycle. ''[[Pillow of Death]]'' (1945) was the last Inner Sanctum. ''[[The Daltons Ride Again]]'' (1945) was a Western.\n\n===Leaving Universal===\nDespite being typecast as the Wolf Man, the 6-foot 2-inch, 220 pound actor managed to carve out a secondary niche as a supporting actor and villain.\n\nHe was in a Bob Hope comedy ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947), supported [[Randolph Scott]] in ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) and had a support in ''[[The Counterfeiters (1948 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' (1948) and played a villain in ''[[16 Fathoms Deep]]'' (1948) for [[Monogram Pictures]], a remake of his 1934 film.\n\nHe reprised his Wolf Man role to great effect in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) but it did not cause a notable boost to his career. In April 1948 Chaney went to hospital after taking an overdose of sleeping pills.<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Takes Too Many Sleeping Pills, Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]23 Apr 1948: 1.</ref>\n\nHe recovered and played Harry Brock in a Los Angeles theatre production of ''[[Born Yesterday (play)|Born Yesterday]]'' in 1949.<ref>Kanin's 'Born Yesterday' Well Acted at Biltmore Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]18 Jan 1949: A7.</ref>\n\nChaney kept busy in support roles: ''[[Captain China]]'' (1950), ''[[Once a Thief (1950 film)|Once a Thief]]'' (1950), ''[[Inside Straight (film)|Inside Straight]]'' (1951), ''[[Bride of the Gorilla]]'' (1951), ''[[Only the Valiant]]'' (1951), ''[[Behave Yourself!]]'' (1951), ''[[Flame of Araby]]'' (1952), ''[[The Bushwackers (film)|The Bushwackers]]'' (1952), ''[[Thief of Damascus]]'' (1952), ''[[Battles of Chief Pontiac]]'' (1952) (in the title role), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Springfield Rifle (film)|Springfield Rifle]]'' (1952), ''[[The Black Castle]]'' (1952) (a return to horror), ''[[Raiders of the Seven Seas]]'' (1953), ''[[A Lion Is in the Streets]]'' (1953), ''[[The Boy from Oklahoma]]'' (1954), ''[[Casanova's Big Night]]'' (1954), ''[[Passion (1954 film)|Passion]]'' (1954), ''[[The Black Pirates]]'' (1954), ''[[Jivaro (film)|Jivaro]]'' (1955), ''[[Big House, U.S.A.]]'' (1955), ''[[I Died a Thousand Times]]'' (1955), ''[[The Indian Fighter]]'' (1955), and ''[[The Black Sleep]]'' (1956)\n\nHe had a leading role in ''[[Indestructible Man]]'' (1956) then was back to support parts: ''[[Manfish]]'' (1956); a [[Martin and Lewis]] comedy, ''[[Pardners]]'' (1956); ''[[Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer]]'' (1957); ''[[The Cyclops (film)|The Cyclops]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Alligator People]]'' (1959).\n\nChaney established himself as a favorite of producer [[Stanley Kramer]]; in addition to playing a key supporting role in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952) (starring [[Gary Cooper]]), he also appeared in ''[[Not as a Stranger]]'' (1955)\u2014a hospital melodrama featuring [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]\u2014and ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]'' (1958, starring [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Sidney Poitier]]). Kramer told the press at the time that whenever a script came in with a role too difficult for most actors in Hollywood, he called Chaney.\n\nOne of his best known roles was a 1952 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717031/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_87 live television version]{{unreliable source|date=April 2019}} of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' on the anthology series ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' for which he allegedly showed up drunk, though that contention is unsubstantiated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/28492/ |title=Film Threat \u2013 The Bootleg Files: Tales Of Tomorrow \u2013 Frankenstein |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> During the live broadcast, Chaney, playing the Monster, apparently thought it was just a rehearsal and he would pick up furniture that he was supposed to break, only to gingerly put it back down while muttering, \"I saved it for you.\" A kinescope of the January 18, 1952 broadcast is available on DVD, [[YouTube]], and also open to the public for viewing at [[The Paley Center for Media]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nHe became quite popular with [[baby boomer]]s after Universal released its back catalog of horror films to television in 1957 (''[[Shock Theater]]'') and ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' magazine regularly focused on his films.\n\nIn 1957, Chaney went to [[Ontario, Canada]], to costar in the first ever American-Canadian television production, as Chingachgook in ''[[Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans]]'', suggested by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s stories. The series ended after 39 episodes. Universal released their film biography of his father, ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957), featuring a semi-fictionalized version of Creighton's life story from his birth up until his father's death. [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] was cast as Creighton as a young adult.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the western series ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'' titled \"The Black Marshal from [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]]\" (1958), and appeared in numerous western series such as ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. He also hosted the 13-episode television [[anthology]] series ''[[13 Demon Street]]'' in 1959, which was created by [[Curt Siodmak]].\n[[File:Dracula vs. Frankenstein Chaney.jpg|thumb|left|Chaney Jr. in ''Dracula vs. Frankenstein'' (1971)]]\n\n===1960s===\nIn the 1960s, Chaney specialised in horror films, such as ''[[House of Terror (1960 film)|House of Terror]]'' (1960), ''[[The Devil's Messenger]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963), replacing [[Boris Karloff]] in the latter for [[Roger Corman]].\n\nHe was in a Western ''[[Law of the Lawless (1963 film)|Law of the Lawless]]'' (1963), ''[[Face of the Screaming Werewolf]]'' (1964), ''[[Witchcraft (1964 film)|Witchcraft]]'' (1964), and ''[[Stage to Thunder Rock]]'' (1964).\n\nHe had one of his best later roles in ''[[Spider Baby]]'', made in 1964 but not released until 1968. Then it was back to Westerns - ''[[Young Fury]]'' (1965), ''[[Black Spurs]]'' (1965), ''[[Town Tamer]]'' (1966), ''[[Johnny Reno]]'' (1967), ''[[Apache Uprising]]'' (1967), ''[[Welcome to Hard Times (film)|Welcome to Hard Times]]'' (1967) and ''[[Buckskin (film)|Buckskin]]'' (1968). There was also horror, such as ''[[Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors]]'' (1967) and ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967).\n\nHis bread-and-butter work during this decade was television \u2013 where he made guest appearances on everything from ''[[Wagon Train]]'' to ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' \u2013 and in a string of supporting roles in low-budget Westerns produced by [[A. C. Lyles]] for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. In 1962, Chaney gained a chance to briefly play Quasimodo in a simulacrum of his father's make-up, as well as return to his roles of the Mummy and the Wolf Man on the television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' with friends [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Peter Lorre]]. During this era, he starred in [[Jack Hill]]'s ''[[Spider Baby]]'' (filmed 1964, released 1968), for which he also sang the title song.\n\n===Final films===\nIn later years, he suffered from [[throat cancer]] and chronic [[heart disease]] among other ailments after decades of heavy drinking and smoking. In his final horror film, ''[[Dracula vs. Frankenstein]]'' (1971), directed by [[Al Adamson]], he played Groton, [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]'s mute henchman. He filmed his part in the spring of 1969, and shortly thereafter performed his final film role, also for Adamson in 1969 in ''[[The Female Bunch]]''.<ref>Weldon, Michael (1983). \"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film\". Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|0-345-34345-X}}. Page 235</ref>  Chaney had lines in ''[[The Female Bunch]]'' but his hoarse, raspy voice was virtually unrecognizable. Due to illness he retired from acting to concentrate on a book about the Chaney family legacy, ''A Century of Chaneys'', which remains to date unpublished in any form. His grandson, [[Ron Chaney]], was working on completing this project.<ref>[http://www.midnightpalace.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=141 Interview with Ron Chaney, including references to Lon's book]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nChaney was married twice. His first wife Dorothy divorced him in 1936 for drinking too much and being \"sullen\".<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Is Sued for Divorce; Wed 10 Years\nChicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963); Chicago, Ill. [Chicago, Ill]26 June 1936: 23.</ref> He remarried in 1937. He had two sons by his first wife, Lon Ralph Chaney (born July 3, 1928) and Ronald Creighton Chaney (born March 18, 1930), both now deceased.\n\nChaney was well liked by some co-workers \u2013 \"sweet\" is the adjective that most commonly emerges from those who acted with, and liked him \u2013 yet he was capable of intense dislikes. For instance, he and frequent co-star [[Evelyn Ankers]] did not get along at all despite their on-camera chemistry. He was also known to befriend younger actors and stand up for older ones who Chaney felt were belittled by the studios. One example was that of [[William Farnum]], a major silent star who played a bit part in ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]''. According to co-star Peter Coe, Chaney demanded that Farnum be given his own chair on the set and be treated with respect, or else he would walk off the picture.\n\nChaney had run-ins with actor [[Frank Reicher]] (whom he nearly strangled on camera in ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'') and director [[Robert Siodmak]] (over whose head Chaney broke a vase).<ref>Smith, Don G., ''Lon Chaney Jr.: Horror Film Star'', McFarland & Co., 1996</ref>\nActor [[Robert Stack]] claimed in his 1980 autobiography that Chaney and drinking buddy [[Broderick Crawford]] were known as \"the monsters\" around the [[Universal Pictures]] lot because of their drunken behavior that frequently resulted in bloodshed.<ref>Stack, Robert, ''Straight Shooting'', Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1980, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Honors===\nIn 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |date=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nChaney died of [[heart failure]] at age 67 on July 12, 1973, in [[San Clemente, California]].<ref>[http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm Cumuseumofterror.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604021624/http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm |date=2008-06-04 }} (Includes Chaney's Death Certificate)</ref> His body was donated for [[medical research]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Lon Chaney Jr., Actor, Is Dead at 67; Portrayed Monsters |quote= Lon Chaney Jr., the film actor, died yesterday at the age of 67.

The film is set in [[Rome]], Italy; it was released in Italian theaters on April 13, 2012,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Eric J.|last=Lyman|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-to-rome-with-love-italian-premiere-312013|title=Woody Allen's ''To Rome With Love'' Draws Mixed Response in Italy at World Premiere|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 13, 2012}}</ref> and opened in Los Angeles and New York City on June 22, 2012.<ref name=\"NYT Review\" />\n\nThe film features an [[ensemble cast]], including Allen himself. The story is told in four [[Anthology film|separate vignettes]]: a clerk who wakes up to find himself a celebrity, an architect who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student, a young couple on their honeymoon, and an Italian funeral director whose uncanny singing ability enraptures his soon to be in-law, an American opera director.\n\n==Plot==\n''To Rome with Love'' tells four unrelated stories taking place in Rome. The second story, Antonio's, is a direct lift with some amendments of an entire [[Federico Fellini]] film, ''[[The White Sheik]]'' (1952).\n\n===Hayley's Story===\nAmerican tourist Hayley falls in love with and becomes engaged to Italian pro bono lawyer Michelangelo while spending a summer in Rome. Her parents, Jerry (Woody Allen) and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fianc\u00e9 and his parents. During the visit, Michelangelo's mortician father Giancarlo sings in the shower and Jerry, a retired\u2014and critically reviled\u2014opera director, feels inspired to bring Giancarlo's gift to the public. Jerry convinces a reluctant Giancarlo to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs, but Giancarlo performs poorly in this setting. Michelangelo accuses Jerry of embarrassing his father and trying to use him to revive his own failed career, which in turn breeds discontent between Michelangelo and Hayley.\n\nJerry then realizes that Giancarlo's talent is tied to the comfort and freedom he feels in the shower; Jerry stages a concert in which Giancarlo performs at the [[Teatro dell'Opera]] while actually washing himself onstage in a purpose-built shower. This is a great success, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage the opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'', with an incongruous shower present in all scenes. Giancarlo receives rave reviews, while Jerry is unaware that he has again been slammed as he has been called \"imbecille\" (\"stupid\" in Italian). Giancarlo decides to retire from opera singing, because he prefers working as a mortician and spending time with his family. But he appreciates being given the chance to live his dream of performing ''Pagliacci'', and his success has mended the relationship between Michelangelo and Hayley.\n\n===Antonio's Story===\n\nNewlyweds Antonio and Milly plan to move to Rome because Antonio's uncles have offered him a job in their family's business. After checking into their hotel, Milly decides to visit a salon before meeting Antonio's relatives. She becomes lost and loses her cell phone, but ends up at a film shoot where she meets Luca Salta, an actor she idolizes. He invites her to lunch. Back at the hotel, Antonio is worried Milly will be late for their lunch date with his aunts and uncles. Anna, a prostitute, then arrives, having mistakenly been sent to his room.\n\nDespite his protests, she wrestles him into a compromising position just as his relatives arrive; the only way he can think to save face is to introduce Anna as Milly, and he convinces her to pose as Milly. The group goes to lunch at the same restaurant Luca takes Milly. Antonio becomes jealous as Luca flirts with Milly, but they don't see Antonio. Antonio's uncles and aunts then take him to a party. Antonio has nothing in common with the people he's introduced to, but most of the male guests are Anna's clients. Anna and Antonio walk in the garden, and Antonio talks about how pure Milly is. When Anna finds out he was a virgin before meeting Milly, she seduces him in the bushes.\n\nMeanwhile, Luca tries to seduce Milly at his hotel room. Milly decides to have sex with him, but then an armed thief emerges and demands their valuables. Suddenly, Luca's wife and a private investigator arrive. Milly and the thief climb into bed and fool Mrs. Salta into believing the hotel room is theirs while Luca hides in the bathroom. Once his wife has left, Luca runs off. The burglar flirts with Milly and she has sex with him instead. When she returns to the hotel room, she and Antonio decide to return to their rustic hometown\u2014but first they begin to make love.\n\n===Leopoldo's Story===\n\nLeopoldo lives a mundane life with his wife and two children. The best part of his day is watching his boss's beautiful secretary Serafina walk around the office. Inexplicably, he wakes up one morning to discover that he has become a national celebrity. Paparazzi document his every move. Reporters ask him what he had for breakfast, if he wears boxers or briefs, whether he thinks it will rain or which hand he scratches. Leopoldo even becomes a manager at his company, and Serafina sleeps with him. He begins dating models and attending fancy film premieres. The constant attention wears on him, though. One day, in the middle of interviewing Leopoldo, the paparazzi spot a man \"who looks more interesting,\" and they abandon Leopoldo. At first, Leopoldo welcomes the return to his old life. But one afternoon he breaks down when no one asks for his autograph. Leopoldo has learned that life can be monotonous and wearying whether one is a celebrity or a normal man. Still, it is much better to be a weary celebrity than it is to be a weary regular man.\n\n===John's Story===\nJohn (Alec Baldwin), a well-known architect, is visiting Rome with his wife and their friends. He had lived there some thirty years ago, and he would rather revisit his old haunts than go sightseeing with the others. While looking for his old apartment building, John meets Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), an American architecture student who recognizes him. Jack happens to live in John's old building, and invites him up to the apartment he shares with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig). Throughout the rest of the story, John appears as a quasi-real and quasi-imaginary figure around Jack and makes unusually frank observations of events.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2012/06/woody_allen_s_to_rome_with_love_reviewed.html | title=To Rome With Love | author=Dana Stevens | date=June 22, 2012 | accessdate=November 4, 2012}}</ref> Sally tells Jack that she invited her best friend Monica, an actress, to stay with them and tells him that Monica (Ellen Page) gives off a sexual vibe that drives men crazy. John predicts Monica will bring trouble, and John keeps telling Jack that Monica will lead him to trouble. Even though John cautions Jack against cheating with Monica, he begins to succumb to her charms. Sally sets Monica up with Leonardo, one of their friends, and Jack is jealous of their relationship. One night he and Monica decide to cook dinner for Sally and Leonardo. They flirt more and more until Jack kisses Monica; they go down to his car to have sex.\n\nJack, now besotted with her, plans to leave Sally for Monica, but they decide Jack should wait until Sally finishes her midterms for Jack to break up with her. The trio go out for lunch after Sally's exams, and when they are alone, Jack tells Monica he plans to dump Sally that night. They make plans to travel to Greece and Sicily together. Then Monica gets a phone call from her agent who says she has been offered a role in a Hollywood blockbuster. She will film in Los Angeles and Tokyo for the next five months and she immediately becomes completely focused on preparing for the role. She forgets about traveling with Jack, who realizes how shallow she is. John and Jack walk back to the Roman street corner where they met and they part ways. It is possible that John's whole experience was actually his memory of what happened to him 30 years ago. (It is loosely implied that Sally is now his wife.)\n\n==Cast==\nGrouped by storylines\n{|\n|valign=top|\n\"Hayley's Story\"\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Hayley, Michelangelo's fianc\u00e9e\n* {{ill|Flavio Parenti|it}} as Michelangelo Santoli, Hayley's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Jerry, Hayley's father and Phyllis' husband\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Phyllis, Hayley's mother and Jerry's wife\n* [[Fabio Armiliato]] as Giancarlo Santoli, Michelangelo's father\n|valign=top|\n\"Leopoldo's Story\"\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Leopoldo Pisanello, a clerk and temporary celebrity\n* Monica Nappo as Sofia Pisanello, Leopoldo's wife\n* Cecilia Capriotti as Serafina, a secretary\n* {{ill|Marta Zoffoli|it}} as Marisa Raguso, an interviewer for Leopoldo\n|-\n|valign=top|\n\"Antonio's Story\"\n* {{ill|Alessandro Tiberi|it}} as Antonio, Milly's husband\n* [[Alessandra Mastronardi]] as Milly, Antonio's wife\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Anna, a prostitute\n* [[Simona Caparrini]] as Joan, Antonio's aunt\n* [[Ornella Muti]] as Pia Fusari, a famous actress\n* [[Antonio Albanese]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/greta-gerwig-alison-pill-join-203353 | title=Greta Gerwig, Alison Pill Join Woody Allen Movie |work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=June 20, 2011 | accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> as Luchina \"Luca\" Salta, a famous actor\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as hotel thief\n* [[Roberto Della Casa]] as Uncle Paolo\n* [[Giuliano Gemma]] as hotel manager\n|valign=top|\n\"John's Story\"\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as John Foy, successful architect and Jack's acquaintance and adviser\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jack, Sally's boyfriend\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Sally, Jack's girlfriend and Monica's best friend\n* [[Ellen Page]] as Monica, Sally's best friend\n* [[Lino Guanciale]] as Leonardo\n|}\n* {{ill|Cristiana Palazzoni|it}}, the [[TG3]] anchorwoman, is a real-life journalist of the Italian network [[Rai 3]].

The four vignettes featured in the film were based on ideas and notes he had written throughout the year before he wrote the script.

The film is set in [[Rome]], Italy; it was released in Italian theaters on April 13, 2012,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Eric J.|last=Lyman|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-to-rome-with-love-italian-premiere-312013|title=Woody Allen's ''To Rome With Love'' Draws Mixed Response in Italy at World Premiere|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 13, 2012}}</ref> and opened in Los Angeles and New York City on June 22, 2012.<ref name=\"NYT Review\" />\n\nThe film features an [[ensemble cast]], including Allen himself. The story is told in four [[Anthology film|separate vignettes]]: a clerk who wakes up to find himself a celebrity, an architect who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student, a young couple on their honeymoon, and an Italian funeral director whose uncanny singing ability enraptures his soon to be in-law, an American opera director.\n\n==Plot==\n''To Rome with Love'' tells four unrelated stories taking place in Rome. The second story, Antonio's, is a direct lift with some amendments of an entire [[Federico Fellini]] film, ''[[The White Sheik]]'' (1952).\n\n===Hayley's Story===\nAmerican tourist Hayley falls in love with and becomes engaged to Italian pro bono lawyer Michelangelo while spending a summer in Rome. Her parents, Jerry (Woody Allen) and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fianc\u00e9 and his parents. During the visit, Michelangelo's mortician father Giancarlo sings in the shower and Jerry, a retired\u2014and critically reviled\u2014opera director, feels inspired to bring Giancarlo's gift to the public. Jerry convinces a reluctant Giancarlo to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs, but Giancarlo performs poorly in this setting. Michelangelo accuses Jerry of embarrassing his father and trying to use him to revive his own failed career, which in turn breeds discontent between Michelangelo and Hayley.\n\nJerry then realizes that Giancarlo's talent is tied to the comfort and freedom he feels in the shower; Jerry stages a concert in which Giancarlo performs at the [[Teatro dell'Opera]] while actually washing himself onstage in a purpose-built shower. This is a great success, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage the opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'', with an incongruous shower present in all scenes. Giancarlo receives rave reviews, while Jerry is unaware that he has again been slammed as he has been called \"imbecille\" (\"stupid\" in Italian). Giancarlo decides to retire from opera singing, because he prefers working as a mortician and spending time with his family. But he appreciates being given the chance to live his dream of performing ''Pagliacci'', and his success has mended the relationship between Michelangelo and Hayley.\n\n===Antonio's Story===\n\nNewlyweds Antonio and Milly plan to move to Rome because Antonio's uncles have offered him a job in their family's business. After checking into their hotel, Milly decides to visit a salon before meeting Antonio's relatives. She becomes lost and loses her cell phone, but ends up at a film shoot where she meets Luca Salta, an actor she idolizes. He invites her to lunch. Back at the hotel, Antonio is worried Milly will be late for their lunch date with his aunts and uncles. Anna, a prostitute, then arrives, having mistakenly been sent to his room.\n\nDespite his protests, she wrestles him into a compromising position just as his relatives arrive; the only way he can think to save face is to introduce Anna as Milly, and he convinces her to pose as Milly. The group goes to lunch at the same restaurant Luca takes Milly. Antonio becomes jealous as Luca flirts with Milly, but they don't see Antonio. Antonio's uncles and aunts then take him to a party. Antonio has nothing in common with the people he's introduced to, but most of the male guests are Anna's clients. Anna and Antonio walk in the garden, and Antonio talks about how pure Milly is. When Anna finds out he was a virgin before meeting Milly, she seduces him in the bushes.\n\nMeanwhile, Luca tries to seduce Milly at his hotel room. Milly decides to have sex with him, but then an armed thief emerges and demands their valuables. Suddenly, Luca's wife and a private investigator arrive. Milly and the thief climb into bed and fool Mrs. Salta into believing the hotel room is theirs while Luca hides in the bathroom. Once his wife has left, Luca runs off. The burglar flirts with Milly and she has sex with him instead. When she returns to the hotel room, she and Antonio decide to return to their rustic hometown\u2014but first they begin to make love.\n\n===Leopoldo's Story===\n\nLeopoldo lives a mundane life with his wife and two children. The best part of his day is watching his boss's beautiful secretary Serafina walk around the office. Inexplicably, he wakes up one morning to discover that he has become a national celebrity. Paparazzi document his every move. Reporters ask him what he had for breakfast, if he wears boxers or briefs, whether he thinks it will rain or which hand he scratches. Leopoldo even becomes a manager at his company, and Serafina sleeps with him. He begins dating models and attending fancy film premieres. The constant attention wears on him, though. One day, in the middle of interviewing Leopoldo, the paparazzi spot a man \"who looks more interesting,\" and they abandon Leopoldo. At first, Leopoldo welcomes the return to his old life. But one afternoon he breaks down when no one asks for his autograph. Leopoldo has learned that life can be monotonous and wearying whether one is a celebrity or a normal man. Still, it is much better to be a weary celebrity than it is to be a weary regular man.\n\n===John's Story===\nJohn (Alec Baldwin), a well-known architect, is visiting Rome with his wife and their friends. He had lived there some thirty years ago, and he would rather revisit his old haunts than go sightseeing with the others. While looking for his old apartment building, John meets Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), an American architecture student who recognizes him. Jack happens to live in John's old building, and invites him up to the apartment he shares with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig). Throughout the rest of the story, John appears as a quasi-real and quasi-imaginary figure around Jack and makes unusually frank observations of events.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2012/06/woody_allen_s_to_rome_with_love_reviewed.html | title=To Rome With Love | author=Dana Stevens | date=June 22, 2012 | accessdate=November 4, 2012}}</ref> Sally tells Jack that she invited her best friend Monica, an actress, to stay with them and tells him that Monica (Ellen Page) gives off a sexual vibe that drives men crazy. John predicts Monica will bring trouble, and John keeps telling Jack that Monica will lead him to trouble. Even though John cautions Jack against cheating with Monica, he begins to succumb to her charms. Sally sets Monica up with Leonardo, one of their friends, and Jack is jealous of their relationship. One night he and Monica decide to cook dinner for Sally and Leonardo. They flirt more and more until Jack kisses Monica; they go down to his car to have sex.\n\nJack, now besotted with her, plans to leave Sally for Monica, but they decide Jack should wait until Sally finishes her midterms for Jack to break up with her. The trio go out for lunch after Sally's exams, and when they are alone, Jack tells Monica he plans to dump Sally that night. They make plans to travel to Greece and Sicily together. Then Monica gets a phone call from her agent who says she has been offered a role in a Hollywood blockbuster. She will film in Los Angeles and Tokyo for the next five months and she immediately becomes completely focused on preparing for the role. She forgets about traveling with Jack, who realizes how shallow she is. John and Jack walk back to the Roman street corner where they met and they part ways. It is possible that John's whole experience was actually his memory of what happened to him 30 years ago. (It is loosely implied that Sally is now his wife.)\n\n==Cast==\nGrouped by storylines\n{|\n|valign=top|\n\"Hayley's Story\"\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Hayley, Michelangelo's fianc\u00e9e\n* {{ill|Flavio Parenti|it}} as Michelangelo Santoli, Hayley's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Jerry, Hayley's father and Phyllis' husband\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Phyllis, Hayley's mother and Jerry's wife\n* [[Fabio Armiliato]] as Giancarlo Santoli, Michelangelo's father\n|valign=top|\n\"Leopoldo's Story\"\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Leopoldo Pisanello, a clerk and temporary celebrity\n* Monica Nappo as Sofia Pisanello, Leopoldo's wife\n* Cecilia Capriotti as Serafina, a secretary\n* {{ill|Marta Zoffoli|it}} as Marisa Raguso, an interviewer for Leopoldo\n|-\n|valign=top|\n\"Antonio's Story\"\n* {{ill|Alessandro Tiberi|it}} as Antonio, Milly's husband\n* [[Alessandra Mastronardi]] as Milly, Antonio's wife\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Anna, a prostitute\n* [[Simona Caparrini]] as Joan, Antonio's aunt\n* [[Ornella Muti]] as Pia Fusari, a famous actress\n* [[Antonio Albanese]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/greta-gerwig-alison-pill-join-203353 | title=Greta Gerwig, Alison Pill Join Woody Allen Movie |work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=June 20, 2011 | accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> as Luchina \"Luca\" Salta, a famous actor\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as hotel thief\n* [[Roberto Della Casa]] as Uncle Paolo\n* [[Giuliano Gemma]] as hotel manager\n|valign=top|\n\"John's Story\"\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as John Foy, successful architect and Jack's acquaintance and adviser\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jack, Sally's boyfriend\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Sally, Jack's girlfriend and Monica's best friend\n* [[Ellen Page]] as Monica, Sally's best friend\n* [[Lino Guanciale]] as Leonardo\n|}\n* {{ill|Cristiana Palazzoni|it}}, the [[TG3]] anchorwoman, is a real-life journalist of the Italian network [[Rai 3]].

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish heritage, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure [[Capitalism|capitalist]]\" and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics. She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

She is revealed to be an enthusiastic adventure fan and [[Clan McDuck]] historian who idolizes Scrooge McDuck as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.imes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-ducktales-d23-expo-20170715-story.html|title='DuckTales' clip shows a whole new Webby Vanderquack|last=Brown|first=Tracy|date=2017-07-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Having spent most of her life sheltered from the outside world by her grandmother (among the activities withheld from her prior to her befriending Huey, Dewey and Louie are theme park visits<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> and sledding<ref name=\"The Impossible Summit of Mt.

While the boys find her slightly intimidating upon their first meeting, they soon accept her as a close friend and surrogate sister, as her optimism and energy often help encourage them.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /><ref name=\"Bustle\" />\n\n===Launchpad McQuack===\n'''Launchpad McQuack''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Beck Bennett]] in the 2017 series) is Scrooge's pilot, and an original ''DuckTales'' character. He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /><ref name=\"The Shadow War!\" /><ref name=\"Friendship Hates Magic!\" />\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews.

He is a self-made billionaire who left [[Scotland]] in his youth and came to [[United States|America]] with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar.

Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of [[Scottish people]].<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures.

She is characterized as younger than the nephews, despite being the same size. She is a tenderhearted girl who is always seen carrying her \"Quacky-Patch\" doll.

He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.<ref name=\"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y.

Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British. After years of being overprotective of Webby, the nephews' arrival causes her to agree to let her granddaughter be a part of Scrooge's adventures.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> Donald refers to her as \"Mrs. B\" and the two don't get along at first; though when the kids are kidnapped by the Beagle Boys, they join forces and eventually gain respect for each other.<ref name=\"Daytrip of Doom!\" /> Initially, Beakley also dislikes Webby's friend Lena, regarding her as a bad influence, but after Lena saves her life she becomes more accepting of her.<ref name=\"Terror of the Terra-firmians!\" /> Beakley's relationship with Scrooge's butler Duckworth is frosty, due to him criticizing her housework.<ref name=\"McMystery at McDuck McManor!\" />\n\n===Donald Duck===\n'''[[Donald Duck]]''' (voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]]) is a signature Disney character, originally debuting in the 1934 animated short \"[[The Wise Little Hen]]\".\n\nIn the 1987 series, his appearance was deliberately downplayed, in order to give more focus to Scrooge and the boys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/iducktalesi-invented-a-new-animated-wonderlandthat-92324 |title=DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland\u2014that quickly disappeared|first=Emily|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews. In \"Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?!\", it's revealed that his anger was rooted in a fear that the world was out to get him and that no one could understand him.

He eventually falls to his apparent death.<br />Since the movie, Merlock has made appearances in several general themed Disney media, including the video games ''[[Legend of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' (the later in which he is voiced by [[Corey Burton]]).\n* '''Drake Von Vladstone'''{{Anchor|Drake Von Vladstone}} (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Drake Von Vladstone, alias [[Count Dracula]] Duck, is the final villain of the video game ''[[DuckTales (video game)|Ducktales]]'' and its remake ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''.

As a result, the school's name was changed to the German European School Singapore (GESS). The following school year, the European IB (English speaking) section of the school started teaching the IB curriculum for grades 1 to 12. Growing student numbers, lead to the decision to open a separate Junior School campus at Jalan Jurong Kechil in August 2008. This was then home to students of both the German and European sections from grade 1 to 5. In 2010, the GESS pre-school department received accreditation to teach the Primary Years Programme IB curriculum and GESS became a fully certified, IB World School.
