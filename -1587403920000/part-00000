Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the [[posterior chamber]], bounded posteriorly by the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] and the [[zonules of Zinn]], and anteriorly by the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. It then flows through the [[pupil]] of the iris into the [[anterior chamber]], bounded posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the [[cornea]].\nFrom here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via the scleral venous sinus ([[Schlemm's canal]]) into [[Intrascleral plexus|scleral plexuses]] and general blood circulation.<ref name=Alguire>{{cite book |author=Alguire P |chapter=The Eye Chapter 118 Tonometry>Basic Science|veditors=Walker HK, Hall WD, Hurst JW |title=Clinical methods: the history, physical, and laboratory examinations |publisher=Butterworths|location=London |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-409-90077-4 |edition=3rd |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201/?partid=222#A3607}}</ref>\n\nIn open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow is reduced through the trabecular meshwork, due to the degeneration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor.

This contact between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively \"scars\").\n\nThese cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so-called \"acute\" angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include a headache and vomiting.\n\nDiagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Prior to the very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.\n\nOnce any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser [[iridotomy]]. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.\n\n'''Primary open-angle glaucoma''' is when optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of the visual field.<ref name=\"Merck-poag\"/> This is associated with increased pressure in the eye. Not all people with primary open-angle glaucoma have eye pressure that is elevated beyond normal, but decreasing the eye pressure further has been shown to stop progression even in these cases.\n\nThe increased pressure is caused by trabecular meshwork blockage. Because the microscopic passageways are blocked, the pressure builds up in the eye and causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss. Peripheral vision is affected first, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.\n\nDiagnosis is made by looking for cupping of the optic nerve. Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways. Beta-blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. [[Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]]s decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of aqueous humor. Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists ([[brimonidine]], [[apraclonidine]]) both decrease fluid production (via inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.\n\n===Developmental glaucoma===\nDevelopmental glaucoma (Q15.0)\n*Primary congenital glaucoma\n*Infantile glaucoma\n*Glaucoma associated with hereditary or familial diseases\n\n===Secondary glaucoma===\nSecondary glaucoma (H40.3-H40.6)\n*Inflammatory glaucoma\n:*Uveitis of all types\n:*Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis\n*Phacogenic glaucoma\n:*Angle-closure glaucoma with mature cataract\n:*Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma secondary to rupture of lens capsule\n:*Phacolytic glaucoma due to phacotoxic meshwork blockage\n:*Subluxation of lens\n*Glaucoma secondary to intraocular hemorrhage\n\n:*[[Hyphema]]\n:*Hemolytic glaucoma, also known as erythroclastic glaucoma\n*Traumatic glaucoma\n:*Angle recession glaucoma: Traumatic recession on anterior chamber angle\n:*Postsurgical glaucoma\n::*Aphakic pupillary block\n::*Ciliary block glaucoma\n*Neovascular glaucoma (see below for more details)\n*Drug-induced glaucoma\n:*Corticosteroid induced glaucoma\n:*Alpha-chymotrypsin glaucoma.

It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in [[ischemia]] of the [[retina]] or [[ciliary body]]. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.\n\nNeovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. Patients with such condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures. A new treatment for this disease, as first reported by Kahook and colleagues, involves the use of a novel group of medications known as [[anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor therapy|anti-VEGF agents]]. These injectable medications can lead to a dramatic decrease in new vessel formation and, if injected early enough in the disease process, may lead to normalization of intraocular pressure. Currently, there are no high-quality controlled trials demonstrating a beneficial effect of anti-VEGF treatments in lowering IOP in people with neovascular glaucoma.<ref name=\"Simha\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Simha A, Aziz K, Braganza A, Abraham L, Samuel P, Lindsley KB |title= Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= 2 |pages= CD007920 |date=2020 |pmid= 32027392|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD007920.pub3 |pmc=7003996}}</ref>\n\n'''Toxic glaucoma''' is open-angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach {{convert|80|mmHg|abbr=on}}. It characteristically manifests as ciliary body inflammation and massive trabecular o[[edema]] that sometimes extends to Schlemm's canal. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur followed neuroretinal breakdown.\n\nAssociated factors include inflammation, drugs, trauma and intraocular surgery, including cataract surgery and vitrectomy procedures. Gede Pardianto (2005) reported on four patients who had toxic glaucoma. One of them underwent phacoemulsification with small particle nucleus drops. Some cases can be resolved with some medication, vitrectomy procedures or trabeculectomy. Valving procedures can give some relief, but further research is required.<ref>Pardianto G, Difficulties on glaucoma in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2006;3: 48\u20139.{{vs|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Absolute glaucoma===\nAbsolute glaucoma (H44.5) is the end stage of all types of glaucoma.

In open angle glaucoma, the iris meets the cornea normally, allowing the fluid from inside the eye to drain, thus relieving the internal pressure. Where this angle is narrowed or closed, pressure increases over time, causing damage to the optic nerve, leading to blindness.\n\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (also, ''primary glaucoma'', ''chronic glaucoma'') refers to slow clogging of the drainage canals resulting in increased eye pressure which causes progressive optic nerve damage. This manifests as a gradual loss of the visual field, starting with a loss of [[peripheral vision]], but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.<ref name=\"Merck-poag\">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec09/ch103/ch103b.html |title=Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Glaucoma: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |accessdate=24 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128223830/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec09/ch103/ch103b.html |archivedate=28 November 2010 }}</ref>  This is the most common type of glaucoma, accounting for 90% of cases in the United States, but fewer in Asian countries.  Onset is slow and painless, and loss of vision is gradual and irreversible.\n\nIn narrow-angle glaucoma (also ''closed-angle glaucoma'') the iris bows forward, narrowing the angle that drains the eye, increasing pressure within the eye.  If untreated, it can lead to the medical emergency of angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIn angle-closure glaucoma (also ''closed-angle glaucoma'', ''primary angle-closure glaucoma'', ''acute glaucoma'') the iris bows forward and causes physical contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which blocks the outflow of aqueous humor from within the eye. This contact may gradually damage the draining function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the intraocular pressure rises. The onset of symptoms is sudden and causes pain and other symptoms that are noticeable; it is treated as a medical emergency.  Unlike open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma is a result of the angle between the iris and cornea closing.  This tends to occur in the [[far-sighted]], who have smaller-than-normal anterior chambers, making physical contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork more likely.\n\nNormal-tension glaucoma (also ''NTG'', ''low-tension glaucoma'', ''normal-pressure glaucoma'') is a condition where the optic nerve is damaged although intraocular pressure (IOP) is in the normal range (12-22mm Hg). Individuals with a family history of NTG, those of Japanese ancestry, those with a history of systemic heart disease, and those with [[Flammer syndrome]] are at a higher than average risk of developing NTG. The cause of NTG is unknown.\n\nSecondary glaucoma refers to any case in which another disease, trauma, drug or procedure causes increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss, and may be mild or severe. It can be due to an eye injury, inflammation, a tumor, or advanced cases of cataracts or diabetes. It can also be caused by certain drugs such as steroids. Treatment depends on whether it is open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIn [[pseudoexfoliation glaucoma]] (also, ''PEX'', ''exfoliation glaucoma'') the pressure is due to the accumulation of microscopic granular protein fibers, which can block normal drainage of the aqueous humor. PEX is prevalent in Scandinavia, primarily in those over 70, and more commonly in women.\n\n[[Pigmentary glaucoma]] (also, pigmentary dispersion syndrome) is caused by pigment cells sloughing off from the back of the iris and floating around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork. It is a rare condition that occurs mostly among Caucasians, mostly males in their mid-20s to 40s, and most are nearsighted.\n\n[[Primary juvenile glaucoma]] is a neonate or juvenile abnormality where ocular hypertension is evident at birth or shortly thereafter and is caused by abnormalities in the anterior chamber angle development that blocks the outflow of the aqueous humor.\n\nUveitic glaucoma is due to uveitis, the swelling and inflammation of the [[uvea]], the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Increased eye pressure in uveitis can result from the inflammation itself or from the steroids used to treat it.\n\n==Screening==\nThe [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] stated, as of 2013, that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moyer|first=Virginia A.|title=Screening for Glaucoma: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=159|issue=7|pages=I-28|date=9 July 2013|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-6-201309170-00685|pmid=23836133|doi-access=free}}</ref> Therefore, there is no national screening program in the US.

Epinephrine's mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular meshwork, which is responsible for absorption of aqueous humor).\n* [[Miosis|Miotic agents]] ([[parasympathomimetic]]s), such as [[pilocarpine]], work by contraction of the [[ciliary muscle]], opening the [[trabecular meshwork]] and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. [[Echothiophate]], an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used in chronic glaucoma.\n* [[Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]], such as [[dorzolamide]], [[brinzolamide]], and [[acetazolamide]], lower secretion of aqueous humor by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body.\n\n===Laser===\nArgon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may be used to treat open-angle glaucoma, but this is a temporary solution, not a cure. A 50-\u03bcm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an [[argon]] laser trabeculoplasty procedure.\n\nNd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or [[pigment dispersion syndrome]]. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.\n\nDiode laser cycloablation lowers IOP by reducing aqueous secretion by destroying secretory ciliary epithelium.<ref name = \"Pardianto2006\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\n[[File:Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma EDA11.JPG|thumb|Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the [[trabecular meshwork]], which helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure.]]\n{{Main|Glaucoma surgery}}\n\nBoth [[Laser surgery|laser]] and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma.  Surgery is the primary therapy for those with [[congenital]] glaucoma.<ref>{{OMIM|231300|Glaucoma, Congenital: GLC3 Buphthalmos}}</ref>  Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.\n\n====Canaloplasty====\nCanaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure using micro[[catheter]] technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to the Schlemm's canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.\n\nBy opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shingleton B, Tetz M, Korber N |title=Circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm's canal (canaloplasty) with temporal clear corneal phacoemulsification cataract surgery for open-angle glaucoma and visually significant cataract: one-year results |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=433\u201340 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18299068 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.11.029}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lewis RA, von Wolff K, Tetz M, etal |title=Canaloplasty: circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm's canal using a flexible microcatheter for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma in adults: interim clinical study analysis |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1217\u201326 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17586378 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.03.051}}</ref>\n\n====Trabeculectomy====\nThe most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the [[trabeculectomy]]. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.\n\nScarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as [[mitomycin C]] (MMC) or [[5-fluorouracil]] (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dada T, Sharma R, Sinha G, Angmo D, Temkar S |year=2016|title=Cyclodialysis-enhanced trabeculectomy with triple Ologen implantation|journal=Eur J Ophthalmol|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.5301/ejo.5000633|pmid=26044372|pages=95\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Yuan|first=F|first2=L|year=2015|title=Biodegradable 3D-Porous Collagen Matrix (Ologen) Compared with Mitomycin C for Treatment of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Results at 5 Years|journal=Journal of Ophthalmology|volume=2015|issue=637537|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1155/2015/637537|pmc=4452460|pmid=26078875|last2=Li|author3=Chen|author4=Yan|author5=Wang}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23640614\">{{cite journal|last=Dada|first=Tanuj|author2=Amit S |author3=Saptorshi M |author4=Meenakshi G|title=Combined Subconjunctival and Subscleral ologen Implant Insertion in Trabeculectomy|journal=Eye |date= May 2013|volume=27|issue=7|page=889|pmc=3709396|doi=10.1038/eye.2013.76|pmid=23640614}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cillino|first=S|author2=Casuccio A |author3=Di Pace F|author4=Cagini C|author5=Ferraro LL|title=Biodegradable collagen matrix implant versus mitomycin-C in trabeculectomy: five-year follow-up|journal=BMC Ophthalmol.|date= Mar 2016|volume=16|issue=24|pages=24|pmc=4779569|doi=10.1186/s12886-016-0198-0|pmid=26946419}}</ref>\n\nCollagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.\n\n====Glaucoma drainage implants====\n{{Main|Glaucoma valve}}\nThe first glaucoma drainage implant was developed in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaucoma.org.nz/memberFiles/Eyelights11-05.pdf |title=Eyelights Newsletter: About Glaucoma New Zealand |publisher=Glaucoma.org |accessdate=20 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113141756/http://glaucoma.org.nz/memberFiles/Eyelights11-05.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2015 }}</ref> Since then, several types of implants have followed on from the original: the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants.

The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist [[Hjalmar August Schi\u00f8tz]] in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply \u2013 often associated with low or irregular blood pressure \u2013 to the retina and optic nerve head.<ref>Daniel Albert and Diane Edwards: The History of Ophthalmologist. Cambridge, Mass. 1996</ref> The first drug to reduce IOP, [[pilocarpine]], was introduced in the 1870s; other major innovations in pharmacological glaucoma therapy were the introduction of [[beta blocker]] eye drops in the 1970s and of [[prostaglandin analogue]]s and topical (locally administered) [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]]s in the mid-1990s..

Several theories exist on its exact etiology. However, the major risk factor for most glaucomas and the focus of treatment is [[increased intraocular pressure]]. Intraocular pressure is a function of production of liquid [[aqueous humor]] by the [[ciliary processes]] of the eye, and its drainage through the [[trabecular meshwork]]. Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the [[posterior chamber]], bounded posteriorly by the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] and the [[zonules of Zinn]], and anteriorly by the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. It then flows through the [[pupil]] of the iris into the [[anterior chamber]], bounded posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the [[cornea]].\nFrom here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via the scleral venous sinus ([[Schlemm's canal]]) into [[Intrascleral plexus|scleral plexuses]] and general blood circulation.<ref name=Alguire>{{cite book |author=Alguire P |chapter=The Eye Chapter 118 Tonometry>Basic Science|veditors=Walker HK, Hall WD, Hurst JW |title=Clinical methods: the history, physical, and laboratory examinations |publisher=Butterworths|location=London |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-409-90077-4 |edition=3rd |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201/?partid=222#A3607}}</ref>\n\nIn open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow is reduced through the trabecular meshwork, due to the degeneration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor.

This contact between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively \"scars\").\n\nThese cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so-called \"acute\" angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include a headache and vomiting.\n\nDiagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Prior to the very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.\n\nOnce any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser [[iridotomy]]. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.\n\n'''Primary open-angle glaucoma''' is when optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of the visual field.<ref name=\"Merck-poag\"/> This is associated with increased pressure in the eye. Not all people with primary open-angle glaucoma have eye pressure that is elevated beyond normal, but decreasing the eye pressure further has been shown to stop progression even in these cases.\n\nThe increased pressure is caused by trabecular meshwork blockage. Because the microscopic passageways are blocked, the pressure builds up in the eye and causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss. Peripheral vision is affected first, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.\n\nDiagnosis is made by looking for cupping of the optic nerve. Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways. Beta-blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. [[Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]]s decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of aqueous humor. Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists ([[brimonidine]], [[apraclonidine]]) both decrease fluid production (via inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.\n\n===Developmental glaucoma===\nDevelopmental glaucoma (Q15.0)\n*Primary congenital glaucoma\n*Infantile glaucoma\n*Glaucoma associated with hereditary or familial diseases\n\n===Secondary glaucoma===\nSecondary glaucoma (H40.3-H40.6)\n*Inflammatory glaucoma\n:*Uveitis of all types\n:*Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis\n*Phacogenic glaucoma\n:*Angle-closure glaucoma with mature cataract\n:*Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma secondary to rupture of lens capsule\n:*Phacolytic glaucoma due to phacotoxic meshwork blockage\n:*Subluxation of lens\n*Glaucoma secondary to intraocular hemorrhage\n\n:*[[Hyphema]]\n:*Hemolytic glaucoma, also known as erythroclastic glaucoma\n*Traumatic glaucoma\n:*Angle recession glaucoma: Traumatic recession on anterior chamber angle\n:*Postsurgical glaucoma\n::*Aphakic pupillary block\n::*Ciliary block glaucoma\n*Neovascular glaucoma (see below for more details)\n*Drug-induced glaucoma\n:*Corticosteroid induced glaucoma\n:*Alpha-chymotrypsin glaucoma.

It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in [[ischemia]] of the [[retina]] or [[ciliary body]]. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.\n\nNeovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. Patients with such condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures. A new treatment for this disease, as first reported by Kahook and colleagues, involves the use of a novel group of medications known as [[anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor therapy|anti-VEGF agents]]. These injectable medications can lead to a dramatic decrease in new vessel formation and, if injected early enough in the disease process, may lead to normalization of intraocular pressure. Currently, there are no high-quality controlled trials demonstrating a beneficial effect of anti-VEGF treatments in lowering IOP in people with neovascular glaucoma.<ref name=\"Simha\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Simha A, Aziz K, Braganza A, Abraham L, Samuel P, Lindsley KB |title= Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= 2 |pages= CD007920 |date=2020 |pmid= 32027392|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD007920.pub3 |pmc=7003996}}</ref>\n\n'''Toxic glaucoma''' is open-angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach {{convert|80|mmHg|abbr=on}}. It characteristically manifests as ciliary body inflammation and massive trabecular o[[edema]] that sometimes extends to Schlemm's canal. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur followed neuroretinal breakdown.\n\nAssociated factors include inflammation, drugs, trauma and intraocular surgery, including cataract surgery and vitrectomy procedures. Gede Pardianto (2005) reported on four patients who had toxic glaucoma. One of them underwent phacoemulsification with small particle nucleus drops. Some cases can be resolved with some medication, vitrectomy procedures or trabeculectomy. Valving procedures can give some relief, but further research is required.<ref>Pardianto G, Difficulties on glaucoma in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2006;3: 48\u20139.{{vs|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Absolute glaucoma===\nAbsolute glaucoma (H44.5) is the end stage of all types of glaucoma.

In open angle glaucoma, the iris meets the cornea normally, allowing the fluid from inside the eye to drain, thus relieving the internal pressure. Where this angle is narrowed or closed, pressure increases over time, causing damage to the optic nerve, leading to blindness.\n\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (also, ''primary glaucoma'', ''chronic glaucoma'') refers to slow clogging of the drainage canals resulting in increased eye pressure which causes progressive optic nerve damage. This manifests as a gradual loss of the visual field, starting with a loss of [[peripheral vision]], but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.<ref name=\"Merck-poag\">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec09/ch103/ch103b.html |title=Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Glaucoma: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |accessdate=24 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128223830/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec09/ch103/ch103b.html |archivedate=28 November 2010 }}</ref>  This is the most common type of glaucoma, accounting for 90% of cases in the United States, but fewer in Asian countries.  Onset is slow and painless, and loss of vision is gradual and irreversible.\n\nIn narrow-angle glaucoma (also ''closed-angle glaucoma'') the iris bows forward, narrowing the angle that drains the eye, increasing pressure within the eye.  If untreated, it can lead to the medical emergency of angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIn angle-closure glaucoma (also ''closed-angle glaucoma'', ''primary angle-closure glaucoma'', ''acute glaucoma'') the iris bows forward and causes physical contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which blocks the outflow of aqueous humor from within the eye. This contact may gradually damage the draining function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the intraocular pressure rises. The onset of symptoms is sudden and causes pain and other symptoms that are noticeable; it is treated as a medical emergency.  Unlike open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma is a result of the angle between the iris and cornea closing.  This tends to occur in the [[far-sighted]], who have smaller-than-normal anterior chambers, making physical contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork more likely.\n\nNormal-tension glaucoma (also ''NTG'', ''low-tension glaucoma'', ''normal-pressure glaucoma'') is a condition where the optic nerve is damaged although intraocular pressure (IOP) is in the normal range (12-22mm Hg). Individuals with a family history of NTG, those of Japanese ancestry, those with a history of systemic heart disease, and those with [[Flammer syndrome]] are at a higher than average risk of developing NTG. The cause of NTG is unknown.\n\nSecondary glaucoma refers to any case in which another disease, trauma, drug or procedure causes increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss, and may be mild or severe. It can be due to an eye injury, inflammation, a tumor, or advanced cases of cataracts or diabetes. It can also be caused by certain drugs such as steroids. Treatment depends on whether it is open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIn [[pseudoexfoliation glaucoma]] (also, ''PEX'', ''exfoliation glaucoma'') the pressure is due to the accumulation of microscopic granular protein fibers, which can block normal drainage of the aqueous humor. PEX is prevalent in Scandinavia, primarily in those over 70, and more commonly in women.\n\n[[Pigmentary glaucoma]] (also, pigmentary dispersion syndrome) is caused by pigment cells sloughing off from the back of the iris and floating around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork. It is a rare condition that occurs mostly among Caucasians, mostly males in their mid-20s to 40s, and most are nearsighted.\n\n[[Primary juvenile glaucoma]] is a neonate or juvenile abnormality where ocular hypertension is evident at birth or shortly thereafter and is caused by abnormalities in the anterior chamber angle development that blocks the outflow of the aqueous humor.\n\nUveitic glaucoma is due to uveitis, the swelling and inflammation of the [[uvea]], the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Increased eye pressure in uveitis can result from the inflammation itself or from the steroids used to treat it.\n\n==Screening==\nThe [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] stated, as of 2013, that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moyer|first=Virginia A.|title=Screening for Glaucoma: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=159|issue=7|pages=I-28|date=9 July 2013|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-6-201309170-00685|pmid=23836133|doi-access=free}}</ref> Therefore, there is no national screening program in the US.

Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an [[argon]] laser trabeculoplasty procedure.\n\nNd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or [[pigment dispersion syndrome]]. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.\n\nDiode laser cycloablation lowers IOP by reducing aqueous secretion by destroying secretory ciliary epithelium.<ref name = \"Pardianto2006\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\n[[File:Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma EDA11.JPG|thumb|Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the [[trabecular meshwork]], which helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure.]]\n{{Main|Glaucoma surgery}}\n\nBoth [[Laser surgery|laser]] and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma.

A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.\n\nBy opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shingleton B, Tetz M, Korber N |title=Circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm's canal (canaloplasty) with temporal clear corneal phacoemulsification cataract surgery for open-angle glaucoma and visually significant cataract: one-year results |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=433\u201340 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18299068 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.11.029}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lewis RA, von Wolff K, Tetz M, etal |title=Canaloplasty: circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm's canal using a flexible microcatheter for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma in adults: interim clinical study analysis |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1217\u201326 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17586378 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.03.051}}</ref>\n\n====Trabeculectomy====\nThe most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the [[trabeculectomy]]. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.\n\nScarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as [[mitomycin C]] (MMC) or [[5-fluorouracil]] (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dada T, Sharma R, Sinha G, Angmo D, Temkar S |year=2016|title=Cyclodialysis-enhanced trabeculectomy with triple Ologen implantation|journal=Eur J Ophthalmol|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.5301/ejo.5000633|pmid=26044372|pages=95\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Yuan|first=F|first2=L|year=2015|title=Biodegradable 3D-Porous Collagen Matrix (Ologen) Compared with Mitomycin C for Treatment of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Results at 5 Years|journal=Journal of Ophthalmology|volume=2015|issue=637537|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1155/2015/637537|pmc=4452460|pmid=26078875|last2=Li|author3=Chen|author4=Yan|author5=Wang}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23640614\">{{cite journal|last=Dada|first=Tanuj|author2=Amit S |author3=Saptorshi M |author4=Meenakshi G|title=Combined Subconjunctival and Subscleral ologen Implant Insertion in Trabeculectomy|journal=Eye |date= May 2013|volume=27|issue=7|page=889|pmc=3709396|doi=10.1038/eye.2013.76|pmid=23640614}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cillino|first=S|author2=Casuccio A |author3=Di Pace F|author4=Cagini C|author5=Ferraro LL|title=Biodegradable collagen matrix implant versus mitomycin-C in trabeculectomy: five-year follow-up|journal=BMC Ophthalmol.|date= Mar 2016|volume=16|issue=24|pages=24|pmc=4779569|doi=10.1186/s12886-016-0198-0|pmid=26946419}}</ref>\n\nCollagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.\n\n====Glaucoma drainage implants====\n{{Main|Glaucoma valve}}\nThe first glaucoma drainage implant was developed in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaucoma.org.nz/memberFiles/Eyelights11-05.pdf |title=Eyelights Newsletter: About Glaucoma New Zealand |publisher=Glaucoma.org |accessdate=20 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113141756/http://glaucoma.org.nz/memberFiles/Eyelights11-05.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2015 }}</ref> Since then, several types of implants have followed on from the original: the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants.

About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor.

{"title_page": "Music of Oregon", "text_new": "{{Music of the United States}}\n[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Woody Guthrie]] wrote several songs about the Northwest under the commission of the [[Bonneville Power Administration]].]]\n\nThe '''music of Oregon''' reflects the diverse array of styles present in the [[music of the United States]], from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] music to the contemporary genres of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic music]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern [[popular music]] traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of [[African-American music|African American]] [[blues]] and the growth of [[gospel music]] in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and Indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon's population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.\n\nThe state's main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when [[The Kingsmen]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] established Oregon as a minor center of [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]]. This led in one direction to the [[blues rock]] tradition of the [[Robert Cray Band]] and [[Curtis Salgado]], and in another direction to the [[hardcore punk]] scene of the early 1980s [[Pacific Northwest]], led by the [[Wipers]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and like-minded bands in [[Seattle]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. Over the next twenty years, [[punk rock]] evolved into [[grunge]], [[riot grrrl]], [[alternative rock]], and, eventually, [[indie rock]]. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American [[independent music]], with a strong [[indie music scene]] developing in Portland. The city's reputation as a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as [[The Decemberists]] (singer [[Colin Meloy]] attended the [[University of Oregon]]), [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[The Dandy Warhols]], [[M. Ward]], [[Logan Lynn]], [[Storm Large]], [[Pink Martini]] and the late [[Elliott Smith]]. [[Floater (band)|Floater]] is Portland's leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] and the [[Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon)|Aladdin Theater]].<ref name=\"Jarman\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Jarman\n |first       = Casey\n |title       = Stone By Stone, An Elder Statesman Of NW Moss-Rock Reps Hard, With Or Without You.\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2008-03-26\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709/\n |accessdate  = 2009-06-29\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091121071707/http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709\n |archivedate = 2009-11-21\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PDXPOSED\">{{cite web\n  | title = \"Floater\" Rocks the Crystal Ballroom\n  | date = 2009-04-11\n  | url =http://vimeo.com/667265\n  |publisher = Vimeo.com\n  | accessdate =2009-06-29\n  | postscript =<!--None-->\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WATERHOUSE\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Waterhouse\n |first       = Ben\n |title       = 2009 Best of Portland Reader's Poll\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2009-04-11\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |publisher   = Wweek.com\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717143402/http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |archivedate = 2010-07-17\n}}</ref> Other prominent musicians have relocated to Portland, including [[Modest Mouse]] (of [[Seattle]]), [[Sleater-Kinney]] (of [[Olympia, Washington]]), [[The Shins]] (of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]), [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] (of [[Austin, Texas]]),  former [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] leader [[Stephen Malkmus]] (of [[Stockton, California]]), singer songwriter [[Patterson Hood]] (of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and [[Athens, Georgia]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/a-southern-gentleman-in-the-old-northwest-patterso.html|title=A Southern Gentleman in the Old Northwest: Patterson Hood on Moving to Portland and Being Inescapably Southern|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}</ref> and former [[R.E.M.]] guitarist [[Peter Buck]] (of [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Athens, Georgia]]).<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/r-e-m-roar-back-with-collapse-into-now-20110207 |title= R.E.M.

[[Jam bands]] have a strong presence in the state, dating back to [[Grateful Dead]] performances at the [[Oregon Country Fair]], and outdoor [[music festival]]s continue to be popular. Portland's [[Waterfront Blues Festival]] is the second largest blues festival in the country. Prominent cultural institutions include the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], [[Oregon Festival of American Music]], [[Oregon Symphony]], and [[Mt. Hood Jazz Festival]].\n\n==Portland==\n===Pop Music===\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, some musical groups from Portland had occasional success on the pop charts.  [[The Kingsmen]] (singer [[Jack Ely]] died in Oregon) were the first to hit the top 10 with their 1960s garage rock classic \"[[Louie Louie]]\" peaking at #2, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] gained popularity in Portland after relocating there from [[Idaho]].  [[The Hudson Brothers]] had several hits, such as \"Mr. Kirby\" (though originally this came when the group was named 'The New Yorkers'), \"So You Are a Star\" and even had their own eponymous TV show during the 1970s.  [[Quarterflash]] (which started out in the 1970s as a jazz band called 'Seafood Mama'), were led by the husband/wife duo Marv & Rindy Ross.  The band had several hits, including a platinum-selling #3 song \"Harden My Heart\" in 1981.  [[Nu Shooz]], also led by a husband/wife duo (John Smith & Valerie Day), also had several hits, their biggest also going to #3 \"[[I Can't Wait (Nu Shooz song)|I Can't Wait]]\" in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|author=Morgan Troper|title=So You Are A Star?

Katr. 5-29-08-->.  The [[Wipers]] and [[Poison Idea]] are the best known representatives of the scene, especially The Wipers, a major [[grunge]] influence.  These bands played at The Met (now [[Dante's]]) and the [[Satyricon (nightclub)|Satyricon]].  Other hardcore bands in the 1980s included [[Lockjaw (band)|Lockjaw]], [[Final Warning]], [[The Jackals]], and [[The Rats (American band)|The Rats]]. [[Hole (band)|Hole]] frontwoman [[Courtney Love]] spent time in Portland, and was active in the city's punk scene at the time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brite, Poppy Z.|title=Courtney Love: The Real Story|year=1997|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=44\u201346|isbn=0-7528-1337-4}}</ref> She initially met [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] at the Satyricon club in 1989.\n\nIn the 1990s bands such as [[Defiance (punk band)|Defiance]], Resist, [[Bugskull]], Detestation, and [[Tragedy (band)|Tragedy]] rose in popularity. An important cult band from Portland was the [[Exploding Hearts]] of the early 2000s. [[Dead Moon]] developed a cult worldwide following with their garage-country punk, starting from the early 1990s.\n\n===Bluegrass and old-time===\nPortland is home to a thriving [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[old-time music]] scene. Popular Portland bands include [[Foghorn Stringband]], and [[The Water Tower Bucket Boys]]. Banjo player [[Tony Furtado]], who has branched out from traditional bluegrass music into [[progressive bluegrass]], jazz, and other genres, currently lives in Portland.  The Portland Old-Time Music Gathering takes place in mid-January each year, with a variety of Northwest musicians, jamming, and square dancing.  This event attracts a more diverse audience than is found at Old-Time events in the rest of the state.\n\n===World and world fusion===\nPortland is home to a thriving world music and international folk dancing scene<ref>http://www.musicfromtherow.com/home/top-10-music-cities-other-than-nashville</ref> including the [[Al-Andalus Ensemble]].

However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern [[popular music]] traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of [[African-American music|African American]] [[blues]] and the growth of [[gospel music]] in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and Indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon's population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.\n\nThe state's main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when [[The Kingsmen]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] established Oregon as a minor center of [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]]. This led in one direction to the [[blues rock]] tradition of the [[Robert Cray Band]] and [[Curtis Salgado]], and in another direction to the [[hardcore punk]] scene of the early 1980s [[Pacific Northwest]], led by the [[Wipers]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and like-minded bands in [[Seattle]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. Over the next twenty years, [[punk rock]] evolved into [[grunge]], [[riot grrrl]], [[alternative rock]], and, eventually, [[indie rock]]. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American [[independent music]], with a strong [[indie music scene]] developing in Portland. The city's reputation as a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as [[The Decemberists]] (singer [[Colin Meloy]] attended the [[University of Oregon]]), [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[The Dandy Warhols]], [[M. Ward]], [[Logan Lynn]], [[Storm Large]], [[Pink Martini]] and the late [[Elliott Smith]]. [[Floater (band)|Floater]] is Portland's leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] and the [[Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon)|Aladdin Theater]].<ref name=\"Jarman\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Jarman\n |first       = Casey\n |title       = Stone By Stone, An Elder Statesman Of NW Moss-Rock Reps Hard, With Or Without You.\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2008-03-26\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709/\n |accessdate  = 2009-06-29\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091121071707/http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709\n |archivedate = 2009-11-21\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PDXPOSED\">{{cite web\n  | title = \"Floater\" Rocks the Crystal Ballroom\n  | date = 2009-04-11\n  | url =http://vimeo.com/667265\n  |publisher = Vimeo.com\n  | accessdate =2009-06-29\n  | postscript =<!--None-->\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WATERHOUSE\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Waterhouse\n |first       = Ben\n |title       = 2009 Best of Portland Reader's Poll\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2009-04-11\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |publisher   = Wweek.com\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717143402/http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |archivedate = 2010-07-17\n}}</ref> Other prominent musicians have relocated to Portland, including [[Modest Mouse]] (of [[Seattle]]), [[Sleater-Kinney]] (of [[Olympia, Washington]]), [[The Shins]] (of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]), [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] (of [[Austin, Texas]]),  former [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] leader [[Stephen Malkmus]] (of [[Stockton, California]]), singer songwriter [[Patterson Hood]] (of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and [[Athens, Georgia]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/a-southern-gentleman-in-the-old-northwest-patterso.html|title=A Southern Gentleman in the Old Northwest: Patterson Hood on Moving to Portland and Being Inescapably Southern|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}</ref> and former [[R.E.M.]] guitarist [[Peter Buck]] (of [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Athens, Georgia]]).<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/r-e-m-roar-back-with-collapse-into-now-20110207 |title= R.E.M.
