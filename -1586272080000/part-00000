While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

For richer people, emissions tend to be associated with things such as eating [[beef]], [[car]]s, [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flying]], and [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|home heating]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/behaviour-change-public-engagement-and-net-zero-imperial-college-london/|title=Behaviour change, public engagement and Net Zero (Imperial College London)|website=Committee on Climate Change|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.\n\n====Distributing emissions abatement costs====\nThere have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;103\u2013105):<ref name=banuri/>\n*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.\n*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\".

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning.

These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.\n\n===Implementation===\nImplementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

Algeria has a large military to counter foreign and domestic threats. It is the direct successor of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], which fought [[French rule in Algeria|French colonial rule]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954-1962).\n\nThe People's National Army include ground forces, the [[Algerian Air Force]], the [[Algerian National Navy|Navy]] (the ''Marine de la R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rienne''), and the [[Algerian Air Defence Force]].<ref>CIA 2009. IISS 2013 does not list the air defence command separately from the air force.</ref> The antecedents of the army were the conventional military units formed in Morocco and Tunisia during the war of independence from France. Except for clashes with Morocco in 1963 and 1976, the armed forces have not been involved in hostilities against a foreign power. Their combat capabilities in defence of the country has thus remained untested, however the Algerian military is arguably recognized to be one of the most professional and well-trained militaries in both Africa and the [[Arab world]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of Algeria}}\n[[File:High School of Aviation.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Salute the flag]]\n\n=== Role in politics ===\nThe Algerian military [[\u00e9lite]] has played a dominating role in [[Algerian politics]] ever since independence in 1962, when the army emerged as the only effective powerbroker in a shattered political landscape dominated by weak and competing political factions. At the end of the war of independence, a split developed between the National Liberation Army and the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]] (GPRA).<ref>Mohamed Harbi, Le FLN, mirage et r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e9ditions Jeune Afrique, Paris, 1980, cited by Lahouari Addi, [http://mondediplo.com/1998/02/02algeria The Algerian army holds the levers of power] Le Monde Diplomatique, English Edition, February 1998.</ref> The GPRA was set up in 1958 to represent the National Liberation Front abroad, mobilise the funds needed to organise the underground movement and support the refugees who had fled to Morocco and Tunisia. But it was the general staff of the ALN that was actually in charge of the revolution. When the war ended, it \"dismissed\" the GPRA and took over the running of the new state.\n\nAfter independence in 1962, the Army, led by [[Houari Boumedi\u00e8ne]], backed [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] to become president.  Recognizing the role that the military played in bringing him to power, Ben Bella appointed senior officers as ministers and other important positions within the new state, including naming Boumedi\u00e8ne as the defence minister.<ref>Willis, M.  Politics and Power in the Maghreb : Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco from Independence to the Arab Spring.  New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nJust three years later, Boumedi\u00e8ne deposed Ben Bella in a coup, which also saw the former take power and the National Assembly replaced by the Revolutionary Council to oversee the development of state structures.  The Council was set up by 26 military officers, including [[Chadli Bendjedid]] and [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], and it gradually entrenched the military  establishment as the founders and the backbone of the Algerian regime.<ref>Cook, S.A. \n (2007).  Ruling but not Governing:  The military and Political Development in  Egypt, Algeria and Turkey.  Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins University Press</ref>  Despite the influence of the army that time was limited due to  state and army leadership were joined under Boumedi\u00e8ne's highly authoritarian presidency, after his death in 1978, the role of the military in politics started to grow from the late 1970s.  The Ministry of Defence took over administrative control of the government after Boumedi\u00e8ne fell ill.  After Boumedi\u00e8ne's death in 1978,\nthe military ensured the continuation of its influence in politics by choosing Colonel [[Chadli Benjedid]] to succeed as the President, as he increasingly relied on the a small number of military advisers for advice.<ref name=\"Willis, M. 1996\">Willis, M.  (1996).  The Islamist Challenge in Algeria: A Political history.  Reading, UK: Ithaca Press</ref>  Despite this, factionalization and rivalries within the military and political \u00e9lites remains a major factor in Algerian politics.\n\nAfter being structured as a politicized \"people's army\" in the Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne era, and retaining its allegiance to the FLN during the [[one-party state]] years of [[History of Algeria|Algerian history]], the military forces were formally depoliticized in 1988, as a [[multi-party system]] was introduced. This, however, did not end military influence over Algerian politics.  It was extremely suspicious of Islamist parties, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] ''(Front Islamique du Salut, FIS)'', and opposed the FIS's legal recognition in 1989.  Since most of the officers were trained overseas in states practicing secular laws, such as France and the Soviet Union, they believe Islamism was a threat to state foundations and a threat to the military's interests.<ref name=\"Willis, M. 1996\"/>  This was reflected in decisions by army chiefs to ban the hedjab and its reluctance to support Iraq during its [[invasion of Kuwait]].\n\nIn 1991, fearing the installation of [[Sharia Law]], which would result in [[Algeria]] becoming an Islamic state, the Algerian Army stopped free elections that were likely to bring an [[Islamism|Islamist]] party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) (''Front Islamique du Salut'') to power.  They also launched a [[coup d'etat]] in January 1991 and forced Bendjedid to resign the presidency.  For many officers, the election of an Islamist Algerian government would be a disaster as they believed it would be catastrophic for the economy through capital flight and foreign petrol companies cancelling their agreements to extract oil and gas in Algeria.  Politically, the military believed the election of the FIS could bring instability to the country, as there were indications that the FIS's opponents are preparing to start armed conflicts against any future Islamist governments.  Despite Benjedid assured the officers that he could keep the FIS in check with his constitutional and institutional powers, the military were still suspicious, as they doubted Benjedid's ability to excersie such powers and feared he might compromise with the FIS to maintain his position, including sacking senior personnel.  \nThe coup and the cancellation of elections triggered the [[Algerian Civil War]] in December 1991, a conflict which is believed to have claimed 100-350,000 lives during the 1990s. During the war, both the armed forces and Islamist insurgents have been severely criticized by outside observers for their conduct of the war on humanitarian and human rights grounds. The state and army Islamist resistance in the late 1990s, but local and sporadic fighting persists in 2009, along with occasional bomb attacks against government targets in major cities. The most active insurgent group is [[al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb]], formerly known as GSPC. Since major fighting subsided in about 1997, the army has been engaged in refitting itself for the tasks of a conventional army, after more than a decade of anti-[[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] action.\n\nOver Boutiflika's 20-year-presidency, the military's influence over politics decreased, as commanders who once held strong political power started to retire, and Boutiflika himself secured more mandate from the people, as his foreign policies rejuvenated Algeria's international status and domestic policies were successful in achieving reconciliation between different sides of the Civil War and achieving peace.\n\nBut the military still has a role in Algerian politics.  This is displayed during the Algerian protests that forced Bouteflika to resign from office in 2019, after losing support of the military, which Chief of Staff of the military, General [[Ahmed Gaid Salah]], demanded that he be declared unfit for office and be removed immediately.\n\n===Border disputes===\nThe major part of Algeria's armed forces are directed towards the country's western border with [[Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]].<ref>U.S. Department of State Background Notes, 2003</ref> Algeria supported the guerrilla [[Western Sahara War]] (1975\u20131991) against Moroccan control of Western Sahara by the [[Polisario Front]], a national [[liberation movement]] of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[Bedouin]] exiled in Algeria's [[Tindouf Province]]. Algeria has had longstanding border disagreements with Morocco, due to the non-recognition of the colonial borders by the Moroccan regime. Although now basically resolved, these continue to linger as a factor in the consistently troubled but generally non-violent relations between the two neighboring states. The Algerian-Moroccan land border has been closed since 1994. Both countries' armed forces have engaged in costly equipment upgrades in recent years, clearly viewing each other as the principal threat to their sovereignty, and equally reluctant to let the other nation gain the upper hand militarily.\n\nBy contrast, Algeria's post-independence border disagreements with [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], which were at times a cause for poor relations, both appear to have been peacefully resolved (to its advantage). The Algerian army has also, especially in later years, been very active along the country's border with northern [[Mali]], where various insurgent movements are based. Algeria has fought only two brief wars and battles after independence (the [[Sand War]], a border conflict with Morocco in 1963 and the [[First battle of Amgala]] in 1976), but the country is also, like most [[Arab world|Arab nations]], formally at war with [[Israel]] since 1948.\n\nIn 1984, after promoting eight colonels to become the first generals in independent Algeria, [[Chadli Benjedid]] announced the establishment of an ANP general staff.<ref>{{cite book |last=Metz |first=Helen |date=1994 |title=Algeria: A Country Study |url=https://archive.org/details/nicaraguacountry00merr/page/257 |location= |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |page=[https://archive.org/details/nicaraguacountry00merr/page/257 257] |isbn=0-8444-0831-X |accessdate=29 June 2018 }}</ref> Previously, the armed forces had relied on the secretary general of the [[Ministry of National Defence (Algeria)|Ministry of National Defence]] to coordinate staff activities. The previous secretary general of the ministry, Major General [[Moustafa Benloucif]], was named the first chief of staff. Benloucif had risen quickly in the ANP and was also an alternate member of the FLN Political Bureau. However, he was dismissed in 1986 without explanation; in 1992 the regime announced that Benloucif would be tried for corruption and the embezzlement of US$11 million, which had been transferred to European accounts.\n\nBouteflika sought to reassert the power of the presidency over the largely autonomous armed forces.<ref>Bonn International Centre for Conversion, [https://www.bicc.de/ssr_gtz/pdf/algeria.pdf Security Sector Reform in Algeria], accessed December 2014.</ref> As Minister of Defence, he nominated new commanders for military regions in August 2004. He also issued a presidential decree creating the position of General Secretary within the Ministry of Defence. Nevertheless, current and retired officers\u2014\"le pouvoir\"\u2014remain important decision-makers.

Algeria has a large military to counter foreign and domestic threats. It is the direct successor of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], which fought [[French rule in Algeria|French colonial rule]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954-1962).\n\nThe People's National Army include ground forces, the [[Algerian Air Force]], the [[Algerian National Navy|Navy]] (the ''Marine de la R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rienne''), and the [[Algerian Air Defence Force]].<ref>CIA 2009. IISS 2013 does not list the air defence command separately from the air force.</ref> The antecedents of the army were the conventional military units formed in Morocco and Tunisia during the war of independence from France. Except for clashes with Morocco in 1963 and 1976, the armed forces have not been involved in hostilities against a foreign power. Their combat capabilities in defence of the country has thus remained untested, however the Algerian military is arguably recognized to be among one of the most professional and well-trained militaries in both Africa and the [[Arab world]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of Algeria}}\n[[File:High School of Aviation.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Salute the flag]]\n\n=== Role in politics ===\nThe Algerian military [[\u00e9lite]] has played a dominating role in [[Algerian politics]] ever since independence in 1962, when the army emerged as the only effective powerbroker in a shattered political landscape dominated by weak and competing political factions. At the end of the war of independence, a split developed between the National Liberation Army and the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]] (GPRA).<ref>Mohamed Harbi, Le FLN, mirage et r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e9ditions Jeune Afrique, Paris, 1980, cited by Lahouari Addi, [http://mondediplo.com/1998/02/02algeria The Algerian army holds the levers of power] Le Monde Diplomatique, English Edition, February 1998.</ref> The GPRA was set up in 1958 to represent the National Liberation Front abroad, mobilise the funds needed to organise the underground movement and support the refugees who had fled to Morocco and Tunisia. But it was the general staff of the ALN that was actually in charge of the revolution. When the war ended, it \"dismissed\" the GPRA and took over the running of the new state.\n\nAfter independence in 1962, the Army, led by [[Houari Boumedi\u00e8ne]], backed [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] to become president.  Recognizing the role that the military played in bringing him to power, Ben Bella appointed senior officers as ministers and other important positions within the new state, including naming Boumedi\u00e8ne as the defence minister.<ref>Willis, M.  Politics and Power in the Maghreb : Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco from Independence to the Arab Spring.  New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nJust three years later, Boumedi\u00e8ne deposed Ben Bella in a coup, which also saw the former take power and the National Assembly replaced by the Revolutionary Council to oversee the development of state structures.  The Council was set up by 26 military officers, including [[Chadli Bendjedid]] and [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], and it gradually entrenched the military  establishment as the founders and the backbone of the Algerian regime.<ref>Cook, S.A. \n (2007).  Ruling but not Governing:  The military and Political Development in  Egypt, Algeria and Turkey.  Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins University Press</ref>  Despite the influence of the army that time was limited due to  state and army leadership were joined under Boumedi\u00e8ne's highly authoritarian presidency, after his death in 1978, the role of the military in politics started to grow from the late 1970s.  The Ministry of Defence took over administrative control of the government after Boumedi\u00e8ne fell ill.  After Boumedi\u00e8ne's death in 1978,\nthe military ensured the continuation of its influence in politics by choosing Colonel [[Chadli Benjedid]] to succeed as the President, as he increasingly relied on the a small number of military advisers for advice.<ref name=\"Willis, M. 1996\">Willis, M.  (1996).  The Islamist Challenge in Algeria: A Political history.  Reading, UK: Ithaca Press</ref>  Despite this, factionalization and rivalries within the military and political \u00e9lites remains a major factor in Algerian politics.\n\nAfter being structured as a politicized \"people's army\" in the Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne era, and retaining its allegiance to the FLN during the [[one-party state]] years of [[History of Algeria|Algerian history]], the military forces were formally depoliticized in 1988, as a [[multi-party system]] was introduced. This, however, did not end military influence over Algerian politics.  It was extremely suspicious of Islamist parties, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] ''(Front Islamique du Salut, FIS)'', and opposed the FIS's legal recognition in 1989.  Since most of the officers were trained overseas in states practicing secular laws, such as France and the Soviet Union, they believe Islamism was a threat to state foundations and a threat to the military's interests.<ref name=\"Willis, M. 1996\"/>  This was reflected in decisions by army chiefs to ban the hedjab and its reluctance to support Iraq during its [[invasion of Kuwait]].\n\nIn 1991, fearing the installation of [[Sharia Law]], which would result in [[Algeria]] becoming an Islamic state, the Algerian Army stopped free elections that were likely to bring an [[Islamism|Islamist]] party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) (''Front Islamique du Salut'') to power.  They also launched a [[coup d'etat]] in January 1991 and forced Bendjedid to resign the presidency.  For many officers, the election of an Islamist Algerian government would be a disaster as they believed it would be catastrophic for the economy through capital flight and foreign petrol companies cancelling their agreements to extract oil and gas in Algeria.  Politically, the military believed the election of the FIS could bring instability to the country, as there were indications that the FIS's opponents are preparing to start armed conflicts against any future Islamist governments.  Despite Benjedid assured the officers that he could keep the FIS in check with his constitutional and institutional powers, the military were still suspicious, as they doubted Benjedid's ability to excersie such powers and feared he might compromise with the FIS to maintain his position, including sacking senior personnel.  \nThe coup and the cancellation of elections triggered the [[Algerian Civil War]] in December 1991, a conflict which is believed to have claimed 100-350,000 lives during the 1990s. During the war, both the armed forces and Islamist insurgents have been severely criticized by outside observers for their conduct of the war on humanitarian and human rights grounds. The state and army Islamist resistance in the late 1990s, but local and sporadic fighting persists in 2009, along with occasional bomb attacks against government targets in major cities. The most active insurgent group is [[al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb]], formerly known as GSPC. Since major fighting subsided in about 1997, the army has been engaged in refitting itself for the tasks of a conventional army, after more than a decade of anti-[[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] action.\n\nOver Boutiflika's 20-year-presidency, the military's influence over politics decreased, as commanders who once held strong political power started to retire, and Boutiflika himself secured more mandate from the people, as his foreign policies rejuvenated Algeria's international status and domestic policies were successful in achieving reconciliation between different sides of the Civil War and achieving peace.\n\nBut the military still has a role in Algerian politics.  This is displayed during the Algerian protests that forced Bouteflika to resign from office in 2019, after losing support of the military, which Chief of Staff of the military, General [[Ahmed Gaid Salah]], demanded that he be declared unfit for office and be removed immediately.\n\n===Border disputes===\nThe major part of Algeria's armed forces are directed towards the country's western border with [[Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]].<ref>U.S. Department of State Background Notes, 2003</ref> Algeria supported the guerrilla [[Western Sahara War]] (1975\u20131991) against Moroccan control of Western Sahara by the [[Polisario Front]], a national [[liberation movement]] of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[Bedouin]] exiled in Algeria's [[Tindouf Province]]. Algeria has had longstanding border disagreements with Morocco, due to the non-recognition of the colonial borders by the Moroccan regime. Although now basically resolved, these continue to linger as a factor in the consistently troubled but generally non-violent relations between the two neighboring states. The Algerian-Moroccan land border has been closed since 1994. Both countries' armed forces have engaged in costly equipment upgrades in recent years, clearly viewing each other as the principal threat to their sovereignty, and equally reluctant to let the other nation gain the upper hand militarily.\n\nBy contrast, Algeria's post-independence border disagreements with [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], which were at times a cause for poor relations, both appear to have been peacefully resolved (to its advantage). The Algerian army has also, especially in later years, been very active along the country's border with northern [[Mali]], where various insurgent movements are based. Algeria has fought only two brief wars and battles after independence (the [[Sand War]], a border conflict with Morocco in 1963 and the [[First battle of Amgala]] in 1976), but the country is also, like most [[Arab world|Arab nations]], formally at war with [[Israel]] since 1948.\n\nIn 1984, after promoting eight colonels to become the first generals in independent Algeria, [[Chadli Benjedid]] announced the establishment of an ANP general staff.<ref>{{cite book |last=Metz |first=Helen |date=1994 |title=Algeria: A Country Study |url=https://archive.org/details/nicaraguacountry00merr/page/257 |location= |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |page=[https://archive.org/details/nicaraguacountry00merr/page/257 257] |isbn=0-8444-0831-X |accessdate=29 June 2018 }}</ref> Previously, the armed forces had relied on the secretary general of the [[Ministry of National Defence (Algeria)|Ministry of National Defence]] to coordinate staff activities. The previous secretary general of the ministry, Major General [[Moustafa Benloucif]], was named the first chief of staff. Benloucif had risen quickly in the ANP and was also an alternate member of the FLN Political Bureau. However, he was dismissed in 1986 without explanation; in 1992 the regime announced that Benloucif would be tried for corruption and the embezzlement of US$11 million, which had been transferred to European accounts.\n\nBouteflika sought to reassert the power of the presidency over the largely autonomous armed forces.<ref>Bonn International Centre for Conversion, [https://www.bicc.de/ssr_gtz/pdf/algeria.pdf Security Sector Reform in Algeria], accessed December 2014.</ref> As Minister of Defence, he nominated new commanders for military regions in August 2004. He also issued a presidential decree creating the position of General Secretary within the Ministry of Defence. Nevertheless, current and retired officers\u2014\"le pouvoir\"\u2014remain important decision-makers. In order to encourage Algerian military reforms, the U.S. decided to allow Algeria to receive [[International Military Education and Training]] (IMET) funds.\n\nAlgeria has the largest defence budget in Africa. Historically, Algeria bought weapons and military equipment from the [[Soviet Union]]. [[United Press International]] reported in March 2013 that Algeria was undergoing a process of military modernization, which includes the introduction of new, more modern warships, aircraft, and tanks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/03/11/Algerias-military-goes-on-an-arms-spree/UPI-89581363031700/ |title=Algeria buying military equipment |publisher=UPI.com |date=2013-03-11 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 January 2013, Algerian troops killed 32 militant hostage-takers and freed more than 650 hostages held at the [[In Amenas hostage crisis|Tigantourine gas facility]], situated near In Amenas in the [[Illizi Province]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/18/world/africa/algeria-hostage-crisis/ | work=CNN | title=Algerian forces seek 'peaceful' settlement of dramatic, deadly hostage crisis - CNN.com | date=2013-01-23}}</ref><ref>http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1130910/anxiety-mounts-over-deadly-hostage-raid-algeria</ref> Nearly 48 hostages are confirmed to be dead.

In practice, the armed forces chief of staff dealt directly with the chiefs of the service branches and with the commanders of the six [[People's National Army (Algeria)#Military regions|military regions]].

Since 2001, security cooperation with the [[United States]] has increased, and US forces have taken part in training missions in the country's [[Sahara]]n south.\n\nAnother weapons supplier of Algeria is France. France and Algeria have had a significant connection since the [[French Algeria]] colonial era, as France supplies weapons and armor to Algerian forces. As of October 2009, it was reported that Algeria canceled a weapons deal with France over the presence of Israeli parts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/301 |title=Algeria cancels weapons deal over Israeli parts |access-date=13 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101035737/http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/301 |archive-date=1 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFour or eight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkau.gov.ua/gateway/news.nsf/d24648715d5b1dbdc3256ab4002b5cec/f2079a3d9e49d691c2257133002da17c!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%93-29&Click=|title=$7,5|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107065130/http://www.nkau.gov.ua/gateway/news.nsf/d24648715d5b1dbdc3256ab4002b5cec/f2079a3d9e49d691c2257133002da17c%21OpenDocument%26Highlight%3D0%2C%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%93-29%26Click%3D/|archive-date=7 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> battalions of Russian [[S-300 (missile)|S-300PMU2]] long-range anti-aircraft missiles were ordered in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missilethreat.com/missiledefensesystems/id.50/system_detail.asp |title=missilethreat.com |publisher=missilethreat.com |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111004257/http://www.missilethreat.com/missiledefensesystems/id.50/system_detail.asp |archivedate=11 November 2011 }}</ref> In 2006, multibillion-dollar purchases of Russian military equipment were made in order to upgrade the country's conventional arsenal. This included a deal by the Algerian Air Force to buy 28 [[SU-30|Su-30MKA]] and 36 [[MiG-29]]SMT for up to $3.5 billion. However, those MiG-29s were returned to Russia in February 2008 because of poor airframe quality, after technical evaluations in [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080218/99490063.html |title=Algeria to return 15 MiG aircraft to Russia over inferior quality |author= |date=18 February 2008 |work= |publisher=RIA Novosti |accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p854040/r_528/military_hardware_foreign_relations/ |title=Algeria Lays Down Russian Arms - Kommersant Moscow |publisher=Kommersant.com |accessdate=2013-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425133338/http://www.kommersant.com/p854040/r_528/military_hardware_foreign_relations |archive-date=25 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In May 2008 the two governments agreed on a new deal to replace those 36 [[MiG-29SMT]] by a new batch of 16 [[Su-30MK|Su-30MKA]] which meet all requirements of Algerian Air Force.\n\nAlgeria also has a small domestic military industry of its own. The army produces [[AK-47]] and [[AKM|AKM-47]] assault rifles, licensed by [[Russia]] and [[China]], as well as rocket-type [[RPG-7|RPGs]] in the Construction Company Mechanical Khenchela (ECMK).\n\nmoreover the ECMK also builds under license the UAE [[Caracal pistol|caracal]] pistol. The logistics base station produces various types of AICV (Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle) for the transport of troops and light armored vehicles. The air force produces two types of light aircraft for the basic training and has produced its own reconnaissance drone since December 2010. The Russian company, [[Rosoboronexport]], has expressed a request for financial assistance to several countries including [[Algeria]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] to participate in the project for the production of the [[Sukhoi Su-57|T-50 (PAK-FA)]] 5th generation fighter aircraft.\n\n===Indigenous military industry===\nAlgeria also has a military industrial company called as the Military Industry of Central Direction, which produces military arms, vehicles, weapons, ships, jets, helicopters, tanks, and other equipment. It was founded in 1998.\n\nThe military industry of Algeria dates back to 1980, when Algeria needed to diversify and sought to have their own national equipment to be less reliant on weapons imported from the Soviet Union and France. The development of the military industry in Algeria in the 1980s played a crucial role when the [[Algerian Civil War]] occurred a decade later. The indigenously manufactured weapons helped the Algerian military in combating the Islamists around the country, contributing to the government's victory in 2002.\n\nAlgeria exports its indigenously manufactured weapons to [[Tunisia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]] and several other African as well as Arab states in the [[Middle East]].\n\nSince 2017 the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Alg\u00e9rienne de Fabrication de V\u00e9hicules de Marque Mercedes Benz\" (SAFAV-MB) supplied the Algerian armed and security forces with several types of Mercedes-Benz vehicles like the [[Unimog|Mercedes-Benz Unimog]], [[Mercedes-Benz Zetros|Zetros]], [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter|Sprinter]], [[Mercedes-Benz Actros|Actros]], [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-class]]...<ref>{{Citation|title=Alg\u00e9rie - Industrie militaire {{!}} SAFAV-MB livre 645 v\u00e9hicules de marque Mercedes Benz|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5FUho6a9Ac|language=en|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\nMoreover all of this vehicles were created in algeria with the vehicles of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des V\u00e9hicules Industrielles\" (SNVI).\n\n==Equipment==\n=== Tanks ===\n{| style=\"width:90%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#aabccc;\"\n!

The novel coronavirus has similar characteristics to [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) and [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). Within a number of weeks, several thousand people in [[Hubei]]'s provincial capital of Wuhan were infected, and the Chinese central government imposed strict containment measures, including a [[2020 Hubei lockdowns|lockdown of Hubei]] itself.\n\nDue to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, and the continued growth of the outbreak in these locations, several countries planned to evacuate their citizens and/or diplomatic staff from the area. This was done primarily through [[air charter|chartered flights]] of the home nations, which were provided prior clearance by Chinese authorities.

The British government plans to send another plane if necessary.<ref name=bbc51318691>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51318691 |title=Britons on Wuhan evacuation flight land in UK |date=31 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131033523/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51318691 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bbc51304204>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51304204 |title=British evacuation flight out of Wuhan delayed |date=30 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130104111/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51304204 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bbc51325192>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51325192 |title=Two coronavirus cases confirmed in UK |date=31 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131094339/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51325192 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|{{FRA}}\n|180<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-plane-carrying-french-citizens-out-of-virus-hit-wuhan-lands-in-south-of-france |title=Coronavirus tests on two French citizens evacuated from China turn out negative |date=2020-01-31 |work=france24 |accessdate=2020-02-02 |author1=france24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202041533/https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-plane-carrying-french-citizens-out-of-virus-hit-wuhan-lands-in-south-of-france |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n|\n|[[Istres-Le Tub\u00e9 Air Base]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|rowspan=\"3\"|{{CHN}}\n|76<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u9996\u67b6\u6c11\u822a\u5305\u673a\u642d\u8f7d\u6ede\u7559\u6d77\u5916\u7684\u6e56\u5317\u540c\u80de\u62b5\u8fbe\u6b66\u6c49 |url=https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1738079.shtml |accessdate=2020-02-02 |date=2020-01-31 |work=[[\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4\u90e8]] |language=zh-CN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201080846/https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1738079.shtml |archive-date=2020-02-01 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|TH}} [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|124<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202001/31/WS5e340259e4b0e6e58393da6f.html |title=\u51c6\u5907\u8d77\u98de\uff01\u7956\u56fd\u6d3e\u4e13\u673a\u63a5\u6ede\u7559\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u7684\u6b66\u6c49\u540c\u80de\u56de\u5bb6 |work=www.bjd.com.cn |access-date=2020-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203084415/http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202001/31/WS5e340259e4b0e6e58393da6f.html |archive-date=2020-02-03 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|MYS}}[[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|111<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202002/02/WS5e361f16e4b002ffe9940422.html |title=\u56de\u5bb6\uff01\u6625\u79cb\u822a\u7a7a\u6d3e\u5305\u673a\u8d74\u65e5\u63a5\u6b66\u6c49\u65c5\u5ba2\u8fd4\u4e61 |work=www.bjd.com.cn |access-date=2020-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203082426/http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202002/02/WS5e361f16e4b002ffe9940422.html |archive-date=2020-02-03 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|JPN}}[[Tokyo Haneda Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|{{GER}}\n|124<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dw.com/de/china-r%C3%BCckkehrer-in-frankfurt-gelandet/a-52225109 |title=China-R\u00fcckkehrer in Frankfurt gelandet |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2020-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202012008/https://www.dw.com/de/china-r%C3%BCckkehrer-in-frankfurt-gelandet/a-52225109 |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dw.com/zh/\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5df2\u6d3e\u51fa\u519b\u673a\u524d\u5f80\u6b66\u6c49\u64a4\u4fa8/a-52216460 |title=\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\uff1a\u5df2\u6d3e\u51fa\u519b\u673a\u524d\u5f80\u6b66\u6c49\u64a4\u4fa8 |access-date=2020-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202201855/https://www.dw.com/zh/%E5%BE%B7%E5%9B%BD%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%B7%B2%E6%B4%BE%E5%87%BA%E5%86%9B%E6%9C%BA%E5%89%8D%E5%BE%80%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E6%92%A4%E4%BE%A8/a-52216460 |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n|\n| rowspan=\"10\" |{{flagicon|CHN}}[[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]\n|[[Frankfurt Airport]]\n|The [[German Air Force]] plane was denied a [[layover|stopover]] in Moscow after its starting point in Wuhan, according to the [[List of German defence ministers|German Minister of Defence]].

The novel coronavirus has similar characteristics to [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) and [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). Within a number of weeks, several thousand people in [[Hubei]]'s provincial capital of Wuhan were infected, and the Chinese central government imposed strict containment measures, including a [[2020 Hubei lockdowns|lockdown of Hubei]] itself.\n\nDue to the effective lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei, and the continued growth of the outbreak in these locations, several countries planned to evacuate their citizens and/or diplomatic staff from the area. This was done primarily through [[air charter|chartered flights]] of the home nations, which were provided prior clearance by Chinese authorities. Japan, India, the United States, France, Australia, [[Sri Lanka]], Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/countries-evaluate-evacuation-of-citizens-amid-wuhan-coronavirus-panic/ |title=Countries Evaluate Evacuation of Citizens Amid Wuhan Coronavirus Panic |agency=Associated Press|website=thediplomat.com |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128150819/https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/countries-evaluate-evacuation-of-citizens-amid-wuhan-coronavirus-panic/ |archive-date=28 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-citizens-china-wuhan-air-india-second-flight-1642434-2020-02-01/ |title=Coronavirus: Second plane carrying 323 Indians from Wuhan to reach Delhi today |last=Press |first=ANI |website=indiatoday.in |access-date=2 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202040329/https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-citizens-china-wuhan-air-india-second-flight-1642434-2020-02-01 |archive-date=2 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/01/27/belgie-haalt-15-landgenoten-terug-uit-hubei-na-uitbraak-coronav/ |title=Belgi\u00eb haalt landgenoten terug uit Chinese provincie Hubei na uitbraak coronavirus |last=NWS |first=VRT |date=27 January 2020 |website=vrtnws.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jakartaglobe.id/news/lastminute-preparations-underway-to-evacuate-indonesian-citizens-from-coronavirusravaged-wuhan |title=Last-Minute Preparations Underway to Evacuate Indonesian Citizens From Coronavirus-Ravaged Wuhan |last=Nathalia |first=Telly |date=30 January 2020 |website=Jakarta Globe}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1844104/c130-aircraft-on-standby-for-wuhan-evacuation |title=C130 aircraft on standby for Wuhan evacuation |date=26 January 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |access-date=26 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=20200125cnn>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/politics/coronavirus-us-evacuate-americans-china/index.html |title=US arranging charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens out of China amid coronavirus outbreak, official says |last=Jiang |first=Steven |date=25 January 2020 |access-date=27 January 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126100201/https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/politics/coronavirus-us-evacuate-americans-china/index.html |archive-date=26 January 2020 |last2=Stracqualursi |first2=Veronica |publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name=20200129tempo>{{Cite news |url=http://tempo.com.ph/2020/01/29/ph-sending-special-flights-to-get-pinoys-from-wuhan-hubei-in-china/ |title=PH sending special flights to get Pinoys from Wuhan, Hubei in China |date=29 January 2020 |work=Tempo |access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref> Pakistan has said that it will not be evacuating any citizens from China due to lack of domestic facilities to help treat Pakistanis who may be infected.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/coronavirus-asia-asean-live-updates-by-country/ |title = The Coronavirus in Asia and ASEAN \u2013 Live Updates by Country|date = 21 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=20200131dialoguepakistan>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dialoguepakistan.com/pakistan-cancels-flights-to-china-as-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/|title=Pakistan cancels flights to China as fears of coronavirus spread|date=31 January 2020|website=Dialogue Pakistan|access-date=31 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131125705/https://www.dialoguepakistan.com/pakistan-cancels-flights-to-china-as-fears-of-coronavirus-spread/|archive-date=31 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==List of evacuations==\n{{Expand list|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!

The British passengers were quarantined at a segregated block of [[Arrowe Park Hospital]] on [[the Wirral]]; all passengers were tested before and during the flight, with none having the virus. The other EU nationals were flown on to Spain from Brize Norton. More Britons (up to 150) were supposed to be on the flight, which was planned to leave a day earlier, but China initially declined permission, and then anyone who had a Chinese passport (including infants and a newborn to British parents) were told they could not leave. Shortly before the flight departed, this decision was reversed, but it was too late for people to get to the airport even though the plane was also delayed for several hours. The British government plans to send another plane if necessary.<ref name=bbc51318691>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51318691 |title=Britons on Wuhan evacuation flight land in UK |date=31 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131033523/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51318691 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bbc51304204>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51304204 |title=British evacuation flight out of Wuhan delayed |date=30 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130104111/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51304204 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bbc51325192>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51325192 |title=Two coronavirus cases confirmed in UK |date=31 January 2020 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131094339/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51325192 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|{{FRA}}\n|180<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-plane-carrying-french-citizens-out-of-virus-hit-wuhan-lands-in-south-of-france |title=Coronavirus tests on two French citizens evacuated from China turn out negative |date=2020-01-31 |work=france24 |accessdate=2020-02-02 |author1=france24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202041533/https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-plane-carrying-french-citizens-out-of-virus-hit-wuhan-lands-in-south-of-france |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n|\n|[[Istres-Le Tub\u00e9 Air Base]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|rowspan=\"3\"|{{CHN}}\n|76<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u9996\u67b6\u6c11\u822a\u5305\u673a\u642d\u8f7d\u6ede\u7559\u6d77\u5916\u7684\u6e56\u5317\u540c\u80de\u62b5\u8fbe\u6b66\u6c49 |url=https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1738079.shtml |accessdate=2020-02-02 |date=2020-01-31 |work=[[\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4\u90e8]] |language=zh-CN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201080846/https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1738079.shtml |archive-date=2020-02-01 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|TH}} [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|124<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202001/31/WS5e340259e4b0e6e58393da6f.html |title=\u51c6\u5907\u8d77\u98de\uff01\u7956\u56fd\u6d3e\u4e13\u673a\u63a5\u6ede\u7559\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u7684\u6b66\u6c49\u540c\u80de\u56de\u5bb6 |work=www.bjd.com.cn |access-date=2020-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203084415/http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202001/31/WS5e340259e4b0e6e58393da6f.html |archive-date=2020-02-03 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|MYS}}[[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|111<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202002/02/WS5e361f16e4b002ffe9940422.html |title=\u56de\u5bb6\uff01\u6625\u79cb\u822a\u7a7a\u6d3e\u5305\u673a\u8d74\u65e5\u63a5\u6b66\u6c49\u65c5\u5ba2\u8fd4\u4e61 |work=www.bjd.com.cn |access-date=2020-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203082426/http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202002/02/WS5e361f16e4b002ffe9940422.html |archive-date=2020-02-03 }}</ref>\n|\n|{{flagicon|JPN}}[[Tokyo Haneda Airport]]\n|\n|-\n|2020-01-31\n|{{GER}}\n|124<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dw.com/de/china-r%C3%BCckkehrer-in-frankfurt-gelandet/a-52225109 |title=China-R\u00fcckkehrer in Frankfurt gelandet |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2020-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202012008/https://www.dw.com/de/china-r%C3%BCckkehrer-in-frankfurt-gelandet/a-52225109 |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dw.com/zh/\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5df2\u6d3e\u51fa\u519b\u673a\u524d\u5f80\u6b66\u6c49\u64a4\u4fa8/a-52216460 |title=\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\uff1a\u5df2\u6d3e\u51fa\u519b\u673a\u524d\u5f80\u6b66\u6c49\u64a4\u4fa8 |access-date=2020-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202201855/https://www.dw.com/zh/%E5%BE%B7%E5%9B%BD%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%B7%B2%E6%B4%BE%E5%87%BA%E5%86%9B%E6%9C%BA%E5%89%8D%E5%BE%80%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E6%92%A4%E4%BE%A8/a-52216460 |archive-date=2020-02-02 }}</ref>\n|\n| rowspan=\"10\" |{{flagicon|CHN}}[[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]\n|[[Frankfurt Airport]]\n|The [[German Air Force]] plane was denied a [[layover|stopover]] in Moscow after its starting point in Wuhan, according to the [[List of German defence ministers|German Minister of Defence]].
