Sometime in the 15th century sailors and builders in Europe realized that walls within a vessel would prevent cargo from shifting during passage. In shipbuilding, any vertical panel was called a \"head\"{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}.

The 5th-century book ''Garden of Strange Things'' by Liu Jingshu mentioned that a ship could allow water to enter the bottom without sinking. Archaeological evidence of bulkhead partitions has been found on a 24&nbsp;m (78&nbsp;ft) long Song Dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled [[Compartment (ship)|compartmental]] sections built [[Waterproofing|watertight]], dated to about 1277.<ref name=\"Needham\"/><ref>Ebrey, Patricia Buckley, Anne Walthall, James B.

Once all the competing songs for the 2019 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the show's producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Estonia performed in position 14 and firmly qualified for the grand final from 4th place with 198 points overall.\n\nAt Eurovision, [[Kaire Vilgats]], [[Dagmar Oja]], [[Kaido P\u00f5ldma]], [[Lars Gunnar S\u00e4fsund]] and author [[Stig R\u00e4sta]] joined Crone off-stage as backing singers during the live performance. The actress and singer [[Saara Kadak]], who supported Crone on stage during the Estonian national final, withdrew due to her wedding day and upcoming premiere of the musical ''West Side Story'' at the Estonian National Opera.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/storm-single/1446425844|title=Storm - Single by Victor Crone|website=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref>\n| title1  = Storm\n| length1 = 3:05\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br/>position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref name=\"Estonia chart\">{{cite news|url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-ajalooline-hetk-nublu-on-esikohalt-kukutatud?id=85430087|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Ajalooline hetk \u2013 nublu on esikohalt kukutatud|last=Nestor|first=Siim|date=25 February 2019|accessdate=28 February 2019|work=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian}}</ref>\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-w16-2-2-2-2-2/|title=Savait\u0117s klausomiausi (TOP 100)|language=Lithuanian|publisher=[[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]]|date=24 May 2019|accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n| 56\n|-\n{{single chart|Scotland|56|date=20190524|rowheader=true|accessdate=25 May 2019}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden ([[Sverigetopplistan]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sverigetopplistan.se/chart/41?dspy=2019&dspp=21|title=Veckolista Singlar, vecka 21|publisher=[[Sverigetopplistan]]|accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref>\n| 39\n|-\n{{single chart|Switzerland|91|artist=Victor Crone|song=Storm|rowheader=true|accessdate=27 May 2019}}\n|-\n{{single chart|UKdownload|59|date=20190524|rowheader=true|accessdate=24 May 2019}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest 2019}}\n\n[[Category:2019 songs]]\n[[Category:Eurovision songs of 2019]]\n[[Category:Eurovision songs of Estonia]]\n[[Category:2019 singles]]\n\n{{Eurovision-stub}}\n{{2010s-single-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Masves", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_(Victor_Crone_song)"}
