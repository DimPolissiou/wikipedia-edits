It is the only theme park in the [[United States]] based entirely on the award-winning [[Educational television|children's educational television]] program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and includes a variety of rides, shows and water attractions suited to young children. It is also the first theme park in the world to become a certified autism center.\n\nSesame Place is one of the 12 theme parks owned and operated by [[SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment|SeaWorld Entertainment]], which operates the park under an exclusive license from [[Sesame Workshop]], the non-profit owner of ''Sesame Street''. Sesame Workshop itself was the park's original owner; the land was sold to [[Anheuser-Busch]] in 1987.\n\n==Overview==\nSesame Place first opened in 1980 near the [[Oxford Valley Mall]] and initiated the expansion of the commercial complex in the vicinity. It was designed by [[Eric McMillan]], a Canadian designer, [[Sandra Hanna]] of [[Lambertville, New Jersey]] and several other designers. The park is open from early May through Halloween for The Count's Halloween Spooktacular, and mid-November through December for A Very Furry Christmas. The original park was {{convert|3|acre}} and featured play areas and large computer labs where kids could color their favorite Sesame Street characters. Since then, it has expanded to {{convert|14|acre}} with rides and water attractions. The expansions included the construction of Cookie's Monster Land in 2014 - the park's largest renovation to date.\n\nIn 2007, it became the first theme park in Pennsylvania to become completely smoke-free.<ref>{{cite pr|url=http://www.sesameplace.com/sesame/pa/parkinfo_4themedia_2007_pressrelease.aspx?PRID=125 |title=SESAME PLACE \u2013 FIRST THEME PARK IN PENNSYLVANIA TO BE 100 PERCENT SMOKE-FREE |publisher=Sesame Place |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=2009-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609204551/http://www.sesameplace.com/sesame/pa/parkinfo_4themedia_2007_pressrelease.aspx?PRID=125 |archivedate=June 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Related parks==\nSesame Place is one of 12 parks operated by [[SeaWorld Entertainment]]. Others include [[SeaWorld Orlando]], [[SeaWorld San Diego]], [[SeaWorld San Antonio]], [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]], [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]], [[Discovery Cove]], [[Aquatica Florida]], [[Adventure Island (water park)|Adventure Island]] and [[Water Country USA]].\n\nFor about 30 years, Busch Entertainment operated Sesame Place in Pennsylvania. In 2009 and 2010, under the new ownership, kiddie areas in Busch Gardens and Sea World parks were converted to Sesame themes. A second [[Irving, Texas|Sesame Place]] park also existed in [[Irving, Texas]] from 1982\u20131984 (a [[Walmart Supercenter]] now sits in its place), closing its doors due to poor attendance and a large number of [[water park]]s competing for its business. A third one in [[Tokyo, Japan]] was open from 1990 until December 31, 2006. In 2017, a third location was announced, to open \"no later than\" mid-2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-releases/5474/|title=SeaWorld Entertainment and Sesame Workshop Announce Expanded Partnership to Include New Sesame Place Theme Park - Sesame Workshop|publisher=}}</ref> In 2019, it was announced that [[Aquatica San Diego]] near [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] would be replaced by a new Sesame Place theme park by spring 2021.\n\nIn 1994, a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' themed amusement park called Parque Plaza Sesamo ([[Plaza S\u00e9samo]]) was opened in [[Monterrey, Mexico]]. According to TEA's Global Attractions Attendance Report, Parque Plaza S\u00e9samo  is one of Latin America's highest ranking theme parks by attendance, with 1.2 million visitors per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf|title=TEA Global Attractions Attendance Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association (TEA)|access-date=}}</ref> In [[Salou]], [[Spain]], the [[PortAventura Park]] has a Sesame Street themed area called S\u00e9samoAventura.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portaventuraworld.com/portaventura/far-west|title=Far West - PortAventura World|website=www.portaventura.es|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> [[Universal Studios Japan]] has a Sesame Street section in their Universal Wonderland themed area.\n\n==Attractions==\n\nEach attraction is split into a category.

It is the only theme park in the [[United States]] based entirely on the award-winning [[Educational television|children's educational television]] program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and includes a variety of rides, shows and water attractions suited to young children. It is also the first theme park in the world to become a certified autism center.\n\nSesame Place is one of the 12 theme parks owned and operated by [[SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment|SeaWorld Entertainment]], which operates the park under an exclusive license from [[Sesame Workshop]], the non-profit owner of ''Sesame Street''. Sesame Workshop itself was the park's original owner; the land was sold to [[Anheuser-Busch]] in 1987.\n\n==Overview==\nSesame Place first opened in 1980 near the [[Oxford Valley Mall]] and initiated the expansion of the commercial complex in the vicinity. It was designed by [[Eric McMillan]], a Canadian designer, [[Sandra Hanna]] of [[Lambertville, New Jersey]] and several other designers. The park is open from early May through Halloween for The Count's Halloween Spooktacular, and mid-November through December for A Very Furry Christmas. The original park was {{convert|3|acre}} and featured play areas and large computer labs where kids could color their favorite Sesame Street characters. Since then, it has expanded to {{convert|14|acre}} with rides and water attractions. The expansions included the construction of Cookie's Monster Land in 2014 - the park's largest renovation to date.\n\nIn 2007, it became the first theme park in Pennsylvania to become completely smoke-free.<ref>{{cite pr|url=http://www.sesameplace.com/sesame/pa/parkinfo_4themedia_2007_pressrelease.aspx?PRID=125 |title=SESAME PLACE \u2013 FIRST THEME PARK IN PENNSYLVANIA TO BE 100 PERCENT SMOKE-FREE |publisher=Sesame Place |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=2009-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609204551/http://www.sesameplace.com/sesame/pa/parkinfo_4themedia_2007_pressrelease.aspx?PRID=125 |archivedate=June 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Related parks==\nSesame Place is one of 12 parks operated by [[SeaWorld Entertainment]]. Others include [[SeaWorld Orlando]], [[SeaWorld San Diego]], [[SeaWorld San Antonio]], [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]], [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]], [[Discovery Cove]], [[Aquatica Florida]], [[Adventure Island (water park)|Adventure Island]] and [[Water Country USA]].\n\nFor about 30 years, Busch Entertainment operated Sesame Place in Pennsylvania. In 2009 and 2010, under the new ownership, kiddie areas in Busch Gardens and Sea World parks were converted to Sesame themes. A second [[Irving, Texas|Sesame Place]] park also existed in [[Irving, Texas]] from 1982\u20131984 (a [[Walmart Supercenter]] now sits in its place), closing its doors due to poor attendance and a large number of [[water park]]s competing for its business. A third one in [[Tokyo, Japan]] was open from 1990 until December 31, 2006. In 2017, a third location was announced, to open \"no later than\" mid-2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-releases/5474/|title=SeaWorld Entertainment and Sesame Workshop Announce Expanded Partnership to Include New Sesame Place Theme Park - Sesame Workshop|publisher=}}</ref> In 2019, it was announced that [[Aquatica San Diego]] near [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] would be replaced by a new Sesame Place theme park by spring 2021.\n\nIn 1994, a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' themed amusement park called Parque Plaza Sesamo ([[Plaza S\u00e9samo]]) was opened in [[Monterrey, Mexico]]. According to TEA's Global Attractions Attendance Report, Parque Plaza S\u00e9samo  is one of Latin America's highest ranking theme parks by attendance, with 1.2 million visitors per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_160_611852_160525.pdf|title=TEA Global Attractions Attendance Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association (TEA)|access-date=}}</ref> In [[Salou]], [[Spain]], the [[PortAventura Park]] has a Sesame Street themed area called S\u00e9samoAventura.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portaventuraworld.com/portaventura/far-west|title=Far West - PortAventura World|website=www.portaventura.es|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> [[Universal Studios Japan]] has a Sesame Street section in their Universal Wonderland themed area.\n\n==Attractions==\n\nEach attraction is split into a category.

In Bangladesh rock music is often recognized as \"band music\". From the 1970s to 2000s, it was sometimes considered as the most popular genre in the country. \n\nFrom the mid 1960s to late 1990s, Bangladeshi rock was heavily influential in the development of various kinds of fusion in [[South Asia|southern asia]] like: [[folk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In the 2000s, Bangladeshi rock music saw the development of heavy metal music as many subgenres emerged in the scene like: \n[[Thrash metal|thrash]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[Progressive metal|progressive]]. \n\nFrom the 2000s to 2010s, genres that emerged in the music scene, included [[Art rock|art]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[post-grunge]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] rock. Though considered the declining decade, the 2010s produced bands that pushed boundaries in the Bangladeshi rock music scene and earned huge popularity.\n\n==Rock and roll (1960s to mid 1980s)==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe foundations of Bangladeshi rock was in 1950s [[American rock|American rock and roll]] and Bengali classical music. Back in the 1960s, American rock and roll artist [[Elvis Presley]] had influenced many great rock bands like: [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Drawing influences from the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists Bangladeshi bands were starting to form to introduce a new kind of music in the country. In the 1960s, the Gramophone Company of Pakistan had imported many [[Long playing|LP]] and [[Single (music)|singles]] of rock and roll artists like [[Cliff Richard and the Shadows]], Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Hollies]], which were sold very well in Bangladesh. These artists was favored mostly by the high school and college students in Bangladesh. Hence, the mid 1960s rock music was influenced and developed a sound that was very similar to the [[Beat (music)|beat]], the [[British Invasion]] and late 1960s [[psychedelic rock]].\n\n[[File:The Lightnings 1968.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Lightnings were considered the first rock and roll band of the country. A photo of them while performing in 1968. From L-R: Shakeel (lead guitars), Noel Mendes (rhythm guitars), Farid Rashid (vocals, bass guitars) and Neo Mendes (drums).]]\n\nZinga formed by Shafaat Ali in Chittagong introduced [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[piano]] to the classical music loving generation and most of the people were getting excited about it. They were also the first one to perform [[Rabindra Sangeet|Tagore songs]] with guitar and piano in the [[Bangladesh Television|East Pakistan TV]] (now BTV).<ref name=\"zg\">{{Cite web|url=http://zingagoshty.com/id38.htm|title=Zinga Biography|website=zingagoshty.com|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> And around that time in 1964 in Dhaka, the Windy Side of Care was formed and they started performing songs of Elvis Presley and [[Cliff Richard]] in the clubs and hotels. \n\nThere's much debate to who is the first 'rock' band of the country. Zinga is the first contender, they were formed in 1963 in Chittagong, but there music was more like adhunik and didn't have the rock and roll sound. It has been argued that the Windy Side of Care was the first rock band of the country formed in 1964. They were also the first band to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock. Their self titled debut album also featured [[raga rock]] song \"Raag Bageshri\". At that time in Chittagong was formed the Lightnings, who were more improved and skilled then the other bands and had the rock and roll sound. In 1968, Zinga released their first song ''Tomari Jiboney'' which became very popular as it was aired on Shadhin Bangla Betar and East Pakistan TV a lot. Shafaat Ali is considered to be the first singer-songwriter of Bangladesh. From the late 1960s, inspired by the Beatles, Zinga became interested in the singer-songwriter concept. Though the song propelled the band, it failed to capture the rock and roll sound. Insex Dui was an American-Bangladeshi band who performed American and British psychedelic rock music in the 1960s. Formed by American students living in Dhaka, they had a complete different sound than the other rock bands of the decade. \n\nBefore becoming a successful Dhallywood actor [[Zafar Iqbal (actor)|Zafar Iqbal]] was a singer in a band named, the Rambling Stones. It was formed in 1966. Other rock bands of the 1960s included Ugly Phases, Fire in Ice and Time Ago Motion. None of this bands released an album.\n\n===Post-Independence===\n\n[[File:Uccharon 1975.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uccharon in 1975. From L-R: [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], Babu, Istiak and Hablu.]]\nMost of the bands from the 1960s did not become that successful and disbanded after the war in 1971. Some musicians went abroad or some of them formed new bands. Bands like Uccharon and Spondon were formed. And they were responsible for taking Bangladeshi rock to a new level, to a new crowd. Writing songs about poverty, the struggles of the people in a new born country, about romance and about the famine. Their songwriting and on stage performance was more improved than the bands of 1960s. \n\nUccharon were the biggest band of that era in South Asia after [[Moheener Ghoraguli]]. Inspired by the 1960s rock music and some Indian classical musician, their frontman [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], a freedom fighter, introduced the [[Hippie|hippie fashion]]. He is sometimes considered to be the first musician with long hair in Bangladesh. With his long hair, bell-bottom jeans, powerful lyrics and open air concerts, Khan cemented himself as a pop culture phenomenon. Their first song, \"Hai Allah Re!\" became a big hit in 1973, after it's release. \"Bangladesh\" a song released by the band in 1975 was a protest song, and inspired many bands to write songs about the struggle of the poor. The had more major hit songs in the decade including \"Ami Jare Chaire\" (1975), \"Ashi Ashi Bole Tumi\" (1977) and \"Papri Keno Bojhena\" (1978).\n\nOn the other hand, Spondon was a band mostly doing classical folk songs. They are the first one in Bangladesh, to perform Lalon geeti as a band, which later inspired many bands of the 2000s and 2010s. Their debut album, ''Spondon Bangladesh'' released in 1975 was the best-selling album of the decade, as told by Bichitra. As in the United States a decade prior, where rock music helped change cultural values about race, religion and sexuality, Bangladeshi rock and roll\u2014dominated by Uccharon\u2014showed people that a different life was possible. The protest songs of Uccharon inspired many bands of the 1980s and 1990s to write songs against the autocrat government.\n\n===Pop rock===\n\n[[File:Souls (Bangladeshi band) 1977.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Souls were the most successful band from the [[Pop rock|pop rock]] genre. From L-R: Sazedul Alam (bass guitar), Subrata Barua Ronny (drums), [[Tapan Chowdhury]] (vocals), Shahedul Alam (electric guitars) and Nakib Khan (keyboards).]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s Bangladesh a flourishing culture of groups emerged, sometimes from the declining early rock and roll scene, mostly in [[Chittagong]] and [[Dhaka]]. There were twenty to thirty bands in these two cities playing in clubs, hotels and halls. Most of these bands were influenced by the [[British Invasion]], [[Music of Bangladesh#Modern Bangla music|Adhunik music]] and the early rock and roll scene in Bangladesh. \n\nThe Akhand Brothers Band was often called the first pop rock band of the country. With their timeless songs like \"Abar Elo Je Shondha\" (1972), \"Ke Bashi Bajai Re\" (1974) and \"Neel Neel Shari Porey\" (1978), these two brothers, [[Lucky Akhand|Lucky]] and [[Happy Akhand]] had cemented themselves as one of the best singer-songwriters and producers of the country. They had helped almost every successful band and artists like: [[Ferdous Wahid]], [[Kumar Bishwajit]], [[Ayub Bachchu]] and [[James (musician)|James]], throughout the late -70s and the -80s. The pop rock music was lead by the Chittagong-based rock band [[Souls (band)|Souls]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/04/05/coverstory.htm|title=Star Magazine|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> After their first single \"Mon Shudhu Mon Chuyeche\" came out in 1980, the band were appreciated by the older rock bands and they released their debut album two years later named, ''Super Souls'', made them one of the best bands of the country. Just like Souls, a band from [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]], Dhaka named Shocking Blue were also doing pop rock music, writing romantic songs. Though not considered a rock band by many critics, [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]] was successful during the decade, used keyboards as a lead instrument, and had a more techno sound than any earlier band. Inspired by Azam Khan, they imitated hippie fashions, wrote songs to change the cultural values of Bangladesh, and were often political.<ref>https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/2018/11/29/we-practised-music-from-our-hearts</ref> [[Miles (band)|Miles]]' [[Miles (Miles album)|self titled debut album]], released in 1982, was the first all-English album in the country. It only featured two original songs by the band. \n\nMost 1970s bands disbanded because of their vocalists' prominence. But, in the 1980s, members maintained cohesion and continued to release hit singles and albums into the 1990s.\n\n==Development (late 1980s to mid 1990s)==\n===Blues rock===\n\n[[File:Feelings live in concert in 1991.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Feelings, performing in a concert in 1991. [[James (musician)|James]] (left) and [[Sumon (musician)|Sumon]] (right).]]\n\nIn parallel with Bangladeshi pop rock music, some musicians were introducing blues as it was a much more newer genre to many people. Guitarist of Souls, [[Ayub Bachchu]] released two albums as a solo artist and quite didn't get the blues very right. In fact for some people, it wasn't even blues rock. Inspired by the American and British [[Blues rock|blues rock]], [[James (musician)|Feelings]] (now Nagar Baul) from Chittagong, had also released two successful blues rock albums, ''Station Road'' (1987), ''Jail Theke Bolchi'' (1993). They were trying get rock music out of the Adhunik music influence and trying to imitate the sound of the 1970s [[Roots rock|roots rock]] bands like: [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Dire Straits]] etc. A number of band and artists followed the blues rock music of Feelings, such as: [[Love Runs Blind]], who later went on to become one of the best band in the country<ref>{{cite news |title=To Rock or Not to Rock| url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends | publisher=dhakatribune.com| access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>. This type of music led Bangladeshi rock to a different kind of subgenres emerging from it, like [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]] and [[Hard rock|hard rock]]. Though the impact of the blues rock bands has declined since then. There has been a renewed interest in the genre, when Ayub Bachchu released his [[Instrumental|instrumental]] blues album ''Sounds of Silence'' (2007), which influenced several young guitarists but didn't get much popularity<ref>{{cite news |title=A Lesson in Evolution of Bangladeshi Rock |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192694 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)]] |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n.\n\n===Pop and hard rock===\n\n[[File:Ayub Bachchu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ayub Bachchu]] from [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]], on stage in 2008.]]\nBands from the 1980s continued their success along with the new bands of the 1990s. Though from 1960s to 1980s, the best rock bands were formed in Chittagong, it transferred to Dhaka in 1990s, as bands from Chittagong also came up to the city for better studio services and success. 1990s is sometimes considered the most productive phase in Bangladeshi music history<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\">{{cite web |title=90'z Rocking the decade |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2006/06/04/special.htm |work=Rising Stars |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>. Rock music became the most popular genre in the country as the bands proved themselves to be much more better artists than the Adhunik music artist. From the 1990s, it was common to divide mainstream rock into pop and hard rock. Pop rock got more popularity than the previous decades as fan-favorite bands like [[Souls (band)|Souls]], and the reformed [[Miles (band)|Miles]], who released the best-selling album of the decade ''Prottasha'' in 1993 and [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], whose frontman Maqsoodul Haque established the Bangladesh Musical Bands Association (BAMBA) in 1990. BAMBA, throughout the 90s, had organized many successful concerts that helped many bands with their career. New successful acts included [[Ark (Bangladeshi band)|Ark]], [[Different Touch]] and Winning. Ark released a string of hit singles, \"Sweety\", \"Ekaki\" and \"Jare Ja\", that formed a new pop rock sensation in the rock music scene. Along with Ark, the pop rock scene was celebrated the whole decade as it remained the most popular rock genre even after two decades of introduction in the country. The decline of the genre was mainly because of many bands adopting a more pop sound influenced by [[Michael Jackson]] and many bands also disbanded due to less success and personal problems between the band members. \n\nIn contrast [[hard rock]] was more influenced by the 1960s [[psychedelic rock]], [[blues rock]] and the 1970s Bangladeshi rock artists. The most successful band from the genre was [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]], who went on to release several best-selling albums in the decade. [[Ayub Bachchu]] the vocalist and electric guitarist of the band, is considered to be the greatest guitarist of Bangladesh and the one of the first to introduce the use of [[Distortion|distortion]]. Some of the 80s bands were also becoming interested in the genre as it's popularity grew, Feedback and Souls had some hard rock numbers in their albums around the year 1993-6. \n\nDrawing influence from the 1980s American [[Soft rock|soft rock]], the genre found it's way to Bangladesh in the mid 1990s. It wasn't very popular during the decade, but was enjoying success for a few years between 1998-9. Paper Rhyme released it's self-titled debut album in 1996 and was praised by many contemporary musicians because of their decade defining song \"Ondhokar Ghore\", which is one of the most covered songs in Bangladesh. The genre was getting lost as soon as Paper Rhyme disbanded in the early 2000s.\n\n===Heavy metal===\nWith roots in [[Blues rock|blues rock]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]] and the British heavy metal bands of the 1970s, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] was introduced in Bangladesh in the mid- 80s by several bands formed by high school and college students. The bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, powerful sound, characterised by overt rhythmic basslines, highly amplified [[Distortion|distortion]], extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. \n\n[[File:RS 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rockstrata was one of the pioneers of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in Bangladesh.]]\n\nThe Bangladeshi heavy metal songwriters, inspired by the lyrics of [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], wrote songs about [[Anti-establishment|anti-establishment]], against the [[autocracy|autocrat]] government and about people's right. The four pioneering metal bands in Bangladesh are: [[Rockstrata]], [[Warfaze]], In Dhaka and Aces. But the first band to perform heavy metal songs in Bangladesh were Waves. The mixed album ''Hooray'' released in 1992 had mostly contained heavy metal numbers and was \"the most important thing that Bangladeshi heavy metal needed\", by many heavy metal musicians of the next decade. Throughout the 1990s, heavy metal was criticised very hardly for the loudness and protest lyrics, and was inspiring the future generation in the genre. Warfaze was the leader of the heavy metal scene in the 1990s, with their popularity they helped in the rise of heavy metal bands in the 2000s. Many subgenres emerged in the Bangladeshi music scene in 2000s and 2010s, such as [[Thrash metal|thrash metal]], [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] and [[Death metal|death metal]]. [[Cryptic Fate]], who released the first all-English heavy metal album in the country, ''Ends are Forever'' in 1994, were also part of the 1990s heavy metal scene. Their sound was often similar to British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]]. \n\nThough it was a very important subgenre of rock, beside pop rock and hard rock, many heavy metal bands didn't get the same popularity as Warfaze, and most of them disbanded the same decade. Heavy metal reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1997-8, before many acts moved off in a variety of directions, including Warfaze and Cryptic Fate, who began to develop [[Neoclassical metal|neo-classical metal]] and thrash metal respectively.\n\n==New subgenres (late 1990s to mid 2000s)==\n\n===Folk rock===\n\n[[File:Concert of Dalchhut at AIUB by Farsad8.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Dalchhut]] performing at an AIUB concert in 2007.]]\n\nBangladeshi rock bands wanted to prove their respect for the [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Folk music|folk music]] of the country to the classical music lovers, musicians and critics from the beginning. Following Indian rock band [[Moheener Ghoraguli]], Bangladeshi rock band the Windy Side of Care and Spondon, the folk rock music came back when [[Dalchhut]] proved their respect and ability to do folk song as a rock band in Bangladesh, with their first three albums ''Ah'' (1997), ''Hridoypur'' (2000) and ''Akashchuri'' (2002). [[Aurthohin]], was formed mainly as a heavy metal band, but composed folk rock hits like: \"Adbhut Shei Cheleti\" and \"Amar Protichhobi\". Frontman [[Sumon (musician)|Saidus Salehin Sumon]] also composed folk rock songs as a solo artists, his debut solo album ''Sumon O Aurthohin'' was one of the first folk rock albums in the country. Aurthohin's first few records are considered to be the first pure folk rock records in Bangladesh as they used rock instruments in their songs. \n\nThe folk rock music gradually changed in the mid-2000s, when [[Bangla (band)|Bangla]] started composing [[Lalon]] songs as a band. The Lalon inspired folk rock began when they released their debut album ''Kingkortobbobimurho'' in 2002. Their attitude toward the conservative Bangladeshi people impacted the teenagers and along with many bands of that era they were protesting against the conservative religious leaders and politicians. Many bands started covering Lalon geeti as they felt the need of spirituality through his philosophy and drugs. [[Lalon Band]] and [[Shayan Chowdhury Arnob|Arnob]] etc. are some successful artists who performed Lalon songs. Even renowned rock musician [[Ayub Bachchu]] was inspired to do folk songs by these bands and released ''Vatir Gane Matir Tane'' (2006), a [[Abdul Alim (folk singer)|Abdul Alim]] cover album. The folk rock scene later influenced successful bands like [[Chirkutt]] and [[Shironamhin]], who were experimenting with many rock genres, mainly with classical, rock and folk. \n\nWith an indiscriminate history, it was not very clear to tell what was the most perfect decade for Bangladeshi rock, which led to a feud between musicians Saidus Salehin Sumon and Ayub Bachchu. It began in the late 1990s, after Sumon's first solo release, when Ayub Bachchu said \"Sumon was nothing new in the rock music of Bangladesh\". The feud started as Sumon also replied saying that \"We don't need no Ayub Bachchu in our band\". There's also a rumour that Sumon said, the 2000s were the most productive phase in Bangladeshi music.\n\n===Alternative music===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the American and British [[Alternative music|alternative]] bands were influencing several young bands in Bangladesh, which were clearly found in the late 1990s and early 2000s [[Alternative rock|alternative rock]]. Alternative bands fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound, and made heavy use of guitar [[Distortion|distortion]], [[Distortion|fuzz]] and [[Audio feedback|feedback]]. The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often wrote songs about political hypocrisy, [[Identity crisis|identity crisis]] and war criminals of Bangladesh .\n\nAround 1998, Kopropholia, Clover Minds and the Spanking Monkeys began playing alternative rock in Dhaka. These Alternative bands with their distinctive sound and casual fashion didn't enjoy too much success in the late -90s<ref>{{cite news |title=Underground |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/2010/10/03/centre.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>. They found their way to the top, when music producers like Isha Khan Duray, Warfaze guitarist [[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] started producing some albums. ''Shopnochura 1'' and ''Shopnochura 2'' are considered to be the main reason for the rise of alternative bands. Several young bands found success as the albums were sold quite well. [[Black (Bangladeshi band)|Black]] were one of the most influencing band in the scene, as the [[Radiohead]] sound had a big impact on them, they influenced the 2010s post-grunge bands. The alternative music was gaining more popularity gradually from 2003 to 2007, when [[Aurthohin]]'s ''[[Aurthohin|Dhurbok]]'' (2003), Black's ''[[Utshober Por]]'' (2003), [[Arbovirus]]' ''64m 53s'' (2006) and Vibe's ''Chena Jogot'' (2007) was selling thousands of copies in the whole country. [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]] along with their protest lyrics and sound climbed their way to the top and made alternative rock an important part of the Bangladeshi rock scene, when two songs from their debut album ''Onneshon'', \"Dhushor Bhabna\" and \"Joyodhoni\" reached the \"[[Radio Foorti]] Top 100 Songs\" chart in 2006. Bands from the alternative scene still remains popular throughout the country, but few successful bands from the genre broke and started popularizing genres such as [[Nu metal|nu metal]] and [[Post-grunge|post-grunge]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Legacy Of Bangladeshi Rock and Roll |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends |publisher=dhakatribune.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>.\n\nShohortoli, Meghdol, Defy and Ashes are four alternative bands that emerged in the scene between the late 2000s to mid 2010s. They mostly composed songs with acoustic instruments. Their lyrics were inspired by the use of [[Marijuana|marijuana]] and influenced the late 2010s rock bands heavily. Shohortoli and Meghdol were formed in [[Dhaka]] in the mid -00s, their lyrics were poetic and composed songs in an artistic way inspired by the music of [[Arnob]]. Shohortoli's most popular track \"Jelkhanar Chithi\", was a nine minute [[Spoken word|spoken word]] song, sometimes considered to be the first one of this genre. Defy and Ashes were both from [[Chittagong]], and was purely writing marijuana inspired songs and earned huge popularity by the mid -10s, when Defy released their album ''Obak Obhijan'' and Ashes released ''Charpoka''<ref>{{cite news |title=BANDS WHO ARE ABOUT TO BRING GOOD MUSIC |url=https://medium.com/@humanotrobot/bangladeshi-rock-bands-who-are-about-to-bring-some-good-music-21f234095542 |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>.\n\n===Experimental===\n\n[[File:Arnab in Dallas,2012B (1 of 1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Arnob]] pictured in 2012, while performing in Dallas, Texas.]]\n\nExperimental rock is the mixture of rock with classical music of different culture. The first experimental rock in Bangladesh is thought to be started by [[Shayan Chowdhury Arnob|Arnob]] in the mid -00s. Experimental bands in Bangladesh sometimes used [[Distortion|distortion]] in electric guitar, along with multiple instruments of different culture like: [[Sitar|sitar]], [[Esraj|esraj]], [[Tabla|tabla]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]] and [[Flute|flute]]. The artists of this genre usually writes songs based on [[Romanticism|romanticism]] and their lyrics are often considered to be poetic. \n\nArnob with his visual arts education from [[Visva Bharati University]] and [[Shironamhin]] with their poetic songs began to develop Bangladeshi rock in an artistic manner, and soon got huge success as both artists sold half a million copies of their albums and was soon being considered one of the greatest of the decade. Most of Arnob's early works were considered to be [[Folk|folk]] or some kind of [[Fusion (music)|fusion]], his most experimental album was ''[[Arnob & Friends Live]]'' (2009), which contained songs from his world tour in 2008. Arnob and Shironamhin, these two artists were also the first to release a [[Rabindra Sangeet|Rabindra sangeet]] album as a rock artists. Shironamhin released ''[[Shironamhin Rabindranath]]'' in 2010 and Arnob released ''[[Adheko Ghume]]'' in 2012. Before this scene, Bangladeshi rock musicians neither did feel the need of being artistic or being philosophical. This particular artists were somehow inspiring the generation along with folk rock musicians in starting a cultural movement in the country to protest against the conservatism of religious leaders and politicians. The popularity of experimented music still remains but, the artists have gone in different directions, with Arnob taking a break from music and Shironamhin who went on to release alternative metal songs. [[Chirkutt]] are the only band doing experimental rock in the 2010s. They tour heavily, mostly perform in stadiums and they also have developed the [[Arena rock|arena rock]] along with other bands like, Arbovirus and Nemesis. Though many young people had lost interest in the genre in the early -10s, their has been a renewed interest in the genre.\n\n==New millenium (late 2000s to mid 2010s)==\n\n===Progressive and experimental metal===\n\n[[File: Artcell (57).jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Artcell]] was the most important and most popular band from the [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] genre.]]\n\nDuring the mid -00s folk and alternative rock scene, few [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] bands were forming and performing in club shows in [[Dhaka]]. The progressive metal bands were inspired by the 90s heavy metal and 00s experimental rock bands. They developed a sound out of heavy metal, playing heavier [[Guitar riff|riffs]], [[Bassline|faster basslines]] and [[Double-bass drum|double bass drumming]], mixing with experimental rock. Their lyrics typically highlight anger about social injustice and hypocrisy and also writes philosophical songs with softer tones. \n\n[[Artcell]] was the band leading this genre and is responsible for popularizing it. Their first two studio albums, ''[[Onno Shomoy]]'' (2006) and ''Oniket Prantor'' (2008) have had a big influence in the 2010s heavy metal scene of Bangladesh than their predecessors. The theme that Artcell used in their songwriting has impacted and changed the band music of Bangladesh. Alternative metal band Vibe also had a few progressive metal numbers in their album, ''Chena Jogot'' in 2007. By the end of the decade, Artcell had stopped releasing albums, which caused the decline of progressive metal and the increasing popularity of [[Symphonic metal|symphonic metal]] and [[Experimental metal|experimental metal]]. Both of these genres derived from prog-metal. Symphonic metal and experimental of the 2010s were mainly making prog-metal, but with more orchestration and keyboards. Successful bands from this genre included, [[De-illumination]], [[Warfaze]]'s late -00s and early -10s work, Sazzad Arefeen's Angry Machine and Ionic Bond, the latter mainly being a [[Melodic death metal|melodic death metal]] band. Bay of Bengal is considered the only experimental metal band in Bangladesh, their use of different instruments in metal music, along with their heavy riffs and guitar solos made them a successful band by the release of their debut album, ''Nirob Durbikkho'' (2016).  While rock music are still heavily heard throughout the country, a budding indie scene started to flourish in smaller concert arenas. Bands like the Crowd, Embers in Snow, Pieket, Orfred, Headline, and Attic, to name a few have brought about a change in the sound of rock with, English songwriting being a common practice in their music. During the early 2010s, the Bangladesh Musical Bands Association (BAMBA) and the Chittagong Musical Bands Association (CMBA) began organising rock concerts in the city<ref>{{cite news |title=NSR IV rocks Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/feature_nsr.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>, which gave exposure to local underground bands. This resulted to the emergence of new rock bands in the city, such as Hemorrhage and Blunderware.<ref>{{cite news |title=Silent tears of underground music in Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/03/04/feature_silent.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi music scene has been changed a lot for couple of years. Many [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] and [[Experimental metal|experimental metal]] bands have come up with new genre and new sound which people have not experienced before. Bands like Karnival and Owned have made an exceptional example of progressing the industry. Although the market is growing slowly, they already have created their own ground. Karnival released their three successful albums; whereas Owned has given two exceptional albums to the listeners. Eclipse is one of the finest band who have successfully moved with symphonic rock musical patterns. Following the unique trends, some bands like Messianic Era, Seventh Sign, Jogot, Attic; are moving forward with dedication. By the end of the decade, Bangladeshi rock saw a resurgence of [[Hard rock|hard rock]] and [[alternative rock|alternative rock]], with bands like Unmaad, the Conclusion, Adverb and the Perfect Criminals releasing successful albums.\n\n===\"Decline\"===\n\nMany criticizers and musicians have claimed that just like the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], rock music had lost it's popularity in Bangladesh during the 2010s. Partly, it has lost ground to [[Bollywood]] music from neighboring India, with its colorful power anthems celebrating life and love. Bollywood songs dominates Bangladeshi radio, and pirated versions are available online for free. Bollywood music even influenced the music [[Dhallywood]], which saw the rise of pop singers like: [[Arfin Rumey]], [[Hridoy Khan]], [[Imran Mahmudul]] and Armaan Alif. Meanwhile, an underground [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] scene has largely replaced rock as the most popular genre among the young. Domestic law has also failed to protect the financial interests of the artists who once drove Bangladesh\u2019s vibrant rock scene. Record industries say that just 10 percent of music in Bangladesh is purchased legally and estimate that music piracy annually costs US$180 million in lost earnings. Increased religiosity, which rejects all things Western in favor of a traditional lifestyle, has also hurt Bangladesh's rock scene. Some young Muslims in Bangladesh even see rock music as a sin. The trend of a band's solo concert has lost it's popularity, as concerts like Joy Bangla Concert and [[RockNation]] has become popular and sells thousand of tickets easily. The solo band concert has now lost it's popularity as these concerts get popular every year. Though losing it's popularity, throughout the 2010s, some rock bands, such as: [[Love Runs Blind]], [[James (musician)|Nagar Baul]],  [[Warfaze]], [[Aurthohin]], [[Artcell]], [[Shironamhin]] and [[Chirkut]] still remains heavily popular.\n\n===Extreme metal===\n\n[[File:Powersurge (4039954420).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Powersurge was the leader of the East Bengal extreme metal scene. Pictured in 2008, Saimum Hasan Nahian (left) and Samir Hafiz (right) in a concert.]]\n\nExtreme metal mainly being an underground genre, got commercial success in Bangladesh in the late 2000s, when [[Powersurge (band)|Powersurge]] and Mechanix took part in D-Rock Star 2008. In that competition Powersurge finished in the first place and Mechanix in the second. These two bands was the main powerhouse of extreme metal of Bangladesh. With these two bands introducing [[Thrash metal|thrash]] and [[Groove metal|groove]] metal to a wider range of audience, [[Severe Dementia (band)|Severe Dementia]] had introduced [[Death metal|death]] few years before them. Death metal vocals usually delivered as guttural \"[[Death growls|death growls]]\", high-pitched [[Screaming|screaming]], complemented by downtuned, highly [[Distortion|distorted]] guitars and extremely fast [[Bass drum|double bass]] percussion. These extreme metal bands had no intention of getting commercial success, as they were all fans of the underground extreme metal of the 1980s. These three bands are considered to be the pioneers of the East Bengal extreme metal. Introducing a different kind of style and sound in the Bangladeshi rock scene, these bands were criticized hardly for the horrific images in their album covers. Other important extreme metal bands in this decade includes: Minerva, Dissector, Thrash, Trainwreck and Nafaarmaan. In 2018, Saimum Hasan Nahian, the guitarist of pioneering extreme metal band Powersurge, urged the [[Wacken Open Air]] authorities to hold a concert in Bangladesh, to promote the talented metal bands of Bangladesh. The Wacken Metal Battle concert was held in the Russian Cultural Center, Dhaka where five metal bands: Karma, Ionic Bond, Torture Goregrinder, Infidel and Trainwreck took part in the competition, and the latter band was the winner. They performed in the [[Bangalore Open Air]], where they won against other metal bands from [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[India]], which got them the ticket to the Wacken Open Air as the first Bangladeshi band.\n\n== Notable bands of Bangladesh ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Bangladesh rock music is often recognized as \"band music\". From the 1970s to 2000s, it was sometimes considered as the most popular genre in the country. \n\nFrom the mid 1960s to late 1990s, Bangladeshi rock was heavily influential in the development of various kinds of fusion in [[South Asia|southern asia]] like: [[folk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In the 2000s, Bangladeshi rock music saw the development of heavy metal music as many subgenres emerged in the scene like: \n[[Thrash metal|thrash]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[Progressive metal|progressive]]. \n\nFrom the 2000s to 2010s, genres that emerged in the music scene, included [[Art rock|art]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[post-grunge]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] rock. Though considered the declining decade, the 2010s produced bands that pushed boundaries in the Bangladeshi rock music scene and earned huge popularity.\n\n==Rock and roll (1960s to mid 1980s)==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe foundations of Bangladeshi rock was in 1950s [[American rock|American rock and roll]] and Bengali classical music. Back in the 1960s, American rock and roll artist [[Elvis Presley]] had influenced many great rock bands like: [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Drawing influences from the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists Bangladeshi bands were starting to form to introduce a new kind of music in the country. In the 1960s, the Gramophone Company of Pakistan had imported many [[Long playing|LP]] and [[Single (music)|singles]] of rock and roll artists like [[Cliff Richard and the Shadows]], Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Hollies]], which were sold very well in Bangladesh. These artists was favored mostly by the high school and college students in Bangladesh. Hence, the mid 1960s rock music was influenced and developed a sound that was very similar to the [[Beat (music)|beat]], the [[British Invasion]] and late 1960s [[psychedelic rock]].\n\n[[File:The Lightnings 1968.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Lightnings were considered the first rock and roll band of the country. A photo of them while performing in 1968. From L-R: Shakeel (lead guitars), Noel Mendes (rhythm guitars), Farid Rashid (vocals, bass guitars) and Neo Mendes (drums).]]\n\nZinga formed by Shafaat Ali in Chittagong introduced [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[piano]] to the classical music loving generation and most of the people were getting excited about it. They were also the first one to perform [[Rabindra Sangeet|Tagore songs]] with guitar and piano in the [[Bangladesh Television|East Pakistan TV]] (now BTV).<ref name=\"zg\">{{Cite web|url=http://zingagoshty.com/id38.htm|title=Zinga Biography|website=zingagoshty.com|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> And around that time in 1964 in Dhaka, the Windy Side of Care was formed and they started performing songs of Elvis Presley and [[Cliff Richard]] in the clubs and hotels. \n\nThere's much debate to who is the first 'rock' band of the country. Zinga is the first contender, they were formed in 1963 in Chittagong, but there music was more like adhunik and didn't have the rock and roll sound. It has been argued that the Windy Side of Care was the first rock band of the country formed in 1964. They were also the first band to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock. Their self titled debut album also featured [[raga rock]] song \"Raag Bageshri\". At that time in Chittagong was formed the Lightnings, who were more improved and skilled then the other bands and had the rock and roll sound. In 1968, Zinga released their first song ''Tomari Jiboney'' which became very popular as it was aired on Shadhin Bangla Betar and East Pakistan TV a lot. Shafaat Ali is considered to be the first singer-songwriter of Bangladesh. From the late 1960s, inspired by the Beatles, Zinga became interested in the singer-songwriter concept. Though the song propelled the band, it failed to capture the rock and roll sound. Insex Dui was an American-Bangladeshi band who performed American and British psychedelic rock music in the 1960s. Formed by American students living in Dhaka, they had a complete different sound than the other rock bands of the decade. \n\nBefore becoming a successful Dhallywood actor [[Zafar Iqbal (actor)|Zafar Iqbal]] was a singer in a band named, the Rambling Stones. It was formed in 1966. Other rock bands of the 1960s included Ugly Phases, Fire in Ice and Time Ago Motion. None of this bands released an album.\n\n===Post-Independence===\n\n[[File:Uccharon 1975.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uccharon in 1975. From L-R: [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], Babu, Istiak and Hablu.]]\nMost of the bands from the 1960s did not become that successful and disbanded after the war in 1971. Some musicians went abroad or some of them formed new bands. Bands like Uccharon and Spondon were formed. And they were responsible for taking Bangladeshi rock to a new level, to a new crowd. Writing songs about poverty, the struggles of the people in a new born country, about romance and about the famine. Their songwriting and on stage performance was more improved than the bands of 1960s. \n\nUccharon were the biggest band of that era in South Asia after [[Moheener Ghoraguli]]. Inspired by the 1960s rock music and some Indian classical musician, their frontman [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], a freedom fighter, introduced the [[Hippie|hippie fashion]]. He is sometimes considered to be the first musician with long hair in Bangladesh. With his long hair, bell-bottom jeans, powerful lyrics and open air concerts, Khan cemented himself as a pop culture phenomenon. Their first song, \"Hai Allah Re!\" became a big hit in 1973, after it's release. \"Bangladesh\" a song released by the band in 1975 was a protest song, and inspired many bands to write songs about the struggle of the poor. The had more major hit songs in the decade including \"Ami Jare Chaire\" (1975), \"Ashi Ashi Bole Tumi\" (1977) and \"Papri Keno Bojhena\" (1978).\n\nOn the other hand, Spondon was a band mostly doing classical folk songs. They are the first one in Bangladesh, to perform Lalon geeti as a band, which later inspired many bands of the 2000s and 2010s. Their debut album, ''Spondon Bangladesh'' released in 1975 was the best-selling album of the decade, as told by Bichitra. As in the United States a decade prior, where rock music helped change cultural values about race, religion and sexuality, Bangladeshi rock and roll\u2014dominated by Uccharon\u2014showed people that a different life was possible. The protest songs of Uccharon inspired many bands of the 1980s and 1990s to write songs against the autocrat government.\n\n===Pop rock===\n\n[[File:Souls (Bangladeshi band) 1977.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Souls were the most successful band from the [[Pop rock|pop rock]] genre. From L-R: Sazedul Alam (bass guitar), Subrata Barua Ronny (drums), [[Tapan Chowdhury]] (vocals), Shahedul Alam (electric guitars) and Nakib Khan (keyboards).]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s Bangladesh a flourishing culture of groups emerged, sometimes from the declining early rock and roll scene, mostly in [[Chittagong]] and [[Dhaka]]. There were twenty to thirty bands in these two cities playing in clubs, hotels and halls. Most of these bands were influenced by the [[British Invasion]], [[Music of Bangladesh#Modern Bangla music|Adhunik music]] and the early rock and roll scene in Bangladesh. \n\nThe Akhand Brothers Band was often called the first pop rock band of the country. With their timeless songs like \"Abar Elo Je Shondha\" (1972), \"Ke Bashi Bajai Re\" (1974) and \"Neel Neel Shari Porey\" (1978), these two brothers, [[Lucky Akhand|Lucky]] and [[Happy Akhand]] had cemented themselves as one of the best singer-songwriters and producers of the country. They had helped almost every successful band and artists like: [[Ferdous Wahid]], [[Kumar Bishwajit]], [[Ayub Bachchu]] and [[James (musician)|James]], throughout the late -70s and the -80s. The pop rock music was lead by the Chittagong-based rock band [[Souls (band)|Souls]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/04/05/coverstory.htm|title=Star Magazine|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> After their first single \"Mon Shudhu Mon Chuyeche\" came out in 1980, the band were appreciated by the older rock bands and they released their debut album two years later named, ''Super Souls'', made them one of the best bands of the country. Just like Souls, a band from [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]], Dhaka named Shocking Blue were also doing pop rock music, writing romantic songs. Though not considered a rock band by many critics, [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]] was successful during the decade, used keyboards as a lead instrument, and had a more techno sound than any earlier band. Inspired by Azam Khan, they imitated hippie fashions, wrote songs to change the cultural values of Bangladesh, and were often political.<ref>https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/2018/11/29/we-practised-music-from-our-hearts</ref> [[Miles (band)|Miles]]' [[Miles (Miles album)|self titled debut album]], released in 1982, was the first all-English album in the country. It only featured two original songs by the band. \n\nMost 1970s bands disbanded because of their vocalists' prominence. But, in the 1980s, members maintained cohesion and continued to release hit singles and albums into the 1990s.\n\n==Development (late 1980s to mid 1990s)==\n===Blues rock===\n\n[[File:Feelings live in concert in 1991.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Feelings, performing in a concert in 1991. [[James (musician)|James]] (left) and [[Sumon (musician)|Sumon]] (right).]]\n\nIn parallel with Bangladeshi pop rock music, some musicians were introducing blues as it was a much more newer genre to many people. Guitarist of Souls, [[Ayub Bachchu]] released two albums as a solo artist and quite didn't get the blues very right. In fact for some people, it wasn't even blues rock. Inspired by the American and British [[Blues rock|blues rock]], [[James (musician)|Feelings]] (now Nagar Baul) from Chittagong, had also released two successful blues rock albums, ''Station Road'' (1987), ''Jail Theke Bolchi'' (1993). They were trying get rock music out of the Adhunik music influence and trying to imitate the sound of the 1970s [[Roots rock|roots rock]] bands like: [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Dire Straits]] etc. A number of band and artists followed the blues rock music of Feelings, such as: [[Love Runs Blind]], who later went on to become one of the best band in the country<ref>{{cite news |title=To Rock or Not to Rock| url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends | publisher=dhakatribune.com| access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>. This type of music led Bangladeshi rock to a different kind of subgenres emerging from it, like [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]] and [[Hard rock|hard rock]]. Though the impact of the blues rock bands has declined since then. There has been a renewed interest in the genre, when Ayub Bachchu released his [[Instrumental|instrumental]] blues album ''Sounds of Silence'' (2007), which influenced several young guitarists but didn't get much popularity<ref>{{cite news |title=A Lesson in Evolution of Bangladeshi Rock |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192694 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)]] |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n.\n\n===Pop and hard rock===\n\n[[File:Ayub Bachchu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ayub Bachchu]] from [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]], on stage in 2008.]]\nBands from the 1980s continued their success along with the new bands of the 1990s. Though from 1960s to 1980s, the best rock bands were formed in Chittagong, it transferred to Dhaka in 1990s, as bands from Chittagong also came up to the city for better studio services and success. 1990s is sometimes considered the most productive phase in Bangladeshi music history<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\">{{cite web |title=90'z Rocking the decade |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2006/06/04/special.htm |work=Rising Stars |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>. Rock music became the most popular genre in the country as the bands proved themselves to be much more better artists than the Adhunik music artist. From the 1990s, it was common to divide mainstream rock into pop and hard rock. Pop rock got more popularity than the previous decades as fan-favorite bands like [[Souls (band)|Souls]], and the reformed [[Miles (band)|Miles]], who released the best-selling album of the decade ''Prottasha'' in 1993 and [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], whose frontman Maqsoodul Haque established the Bangladesh Musical Bands Association (BAMBA) in 1990. BAMBA, throughout the 90s, had organized many successful concerts that helped many bands with their career. New successful acts included [[Ark (Bangladeshi band)|Ark]], [[Different Touch]] and Winning. Ark released a string of hit singles, \"Sweety\", \"Ekaki\" and \"Jare Ja\", that formed a new pop rock sensation in the rock music scene. Along with Ark, the pop rock scene was celebrated the whole decade as it remained the most popular rock genre even after two decades of introduction in the country. The decline of the genre was mainly because of many bands adopting a more pop sound influenced by [[Michael Jackson]] and many bands also disbanded due to less success and personal problems between the band members. \n\nIn contrast [[hard rock]] was more influenced by the 1960s [[psychedelic rock]], [[blues rock]] and the 1970s Bangladeshi rock artists. The most successful band from the genre was [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]], who went on to release several best-selling albums in the decade. [[Ayub Bachchu]] the vocalist and electric guitarist of the band, is considered to be the greatest guitarist of Bangladesh and the one of the first to introduce the use of [[Distortion|distortion]]. Some of the 80s bands were also becoming interested in the genre as it's popularity grew, Feedback and Souls had some hard rock numbers in their albums around the year 1993-6. \n\nDrawing influence from the 1980s American [[Soft rock|soft rock]], the genre found it's way to Bangladesh in the mid 1990s. It wasn't very popular during the decade, but was enjoying success for a few years between 1998-9. Paper Rhyme released it's self-titled debut album in 1996 and was praised by many contemporary musicians because of their decade defining song \"Ondhokar Ghore\", which is one of the most covered songs in Bangladesh. The genre was getting lost as soon as Paper Rhyme disbanded in the early 2000s.\n\n===Heavy metal===\nWith roots in [[Blues rock|blues rock]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]] and the British heavy metal bands of the 1970s, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] was introduced in Bangladesh in the mid- 80s by several bands formed by high school and college students. The bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, powerful sound, characterised by overt rhythmic basslines, highly amplified [[Distortion|distortion]], extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. \n\n[[File:RS 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rockstrata was one of the pioneers of [[Heavy metal|heavy metal]] in Bangladesh.]]\n\nThe Bangladeshi heavy metal songwriters, inspired by the lyrics of [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], wrote songs about [[Anti-establishment|anti-establishment]], against the [[autocracy|autocrat]] government and about people's right. The four pioneering metal bands in Bangladesh are: [[Rockstrata]], [[Warfaze]], In Dhaka and Aces. But the first band to perform heavy metal songs in Bangladesh were Waves. The mixed album ''Hooray'' released in 1992 had mostly contained heavy metal numbers and was \"the most important thing that Bangladeshi heavy metal needed\", by many heavy metal musicians of the next decade. Throughout the 1990s, heavy metal was criticised very hardly for the loudness and protest lyrics, and was inspiring the future generation in the genre. Warfaze was the leader of the heavy metal scene in the 1990s, with their popularity they helped in the rise of heavy metal bands in the 2000s. Many subgenres emerged in the Bangladeshi music scene in 2000s and 2010s, such as [[Thrash metal|thrash metal]], [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] and [[Death metal|death metal]]. [[Cryptic Fate]], who released the first all-English heavy metal album in the country, ''Ends are Forever'' in 1994, were also part of the 1990s heavy metal scene. Their sound was often similar to British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]]. \n\nThough it was a very important subgenre of rock, beside pop rock and hard rock, many heavy metal bands didn't get the same popularity as Warfaze, and most of them disbanded the same decade. Heavy metal reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1997-8, before many acts moved off in a variety of directions, including Warfaze and Cryptic Fate, who began to develop [[Neoclassical metal|neo-classical metal]] and thrash metal respectively.\n\n==New subgenres (late 1990s to mid 2000s)==\n\n===Folk rock===\n\n[[File:Concert of Dalchhut at AIUB by Farsad8.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Dalchhut]] performing at an AIUB concert in 2007.]]\n\nBangladeshi rock bands wanted to prove their respect for the [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Folk music|folk music]] of the country to the classical music lovers, musicians and critics from the beginning. Following Indian rock band [[Moheener Ghoraguli]], Bangladeshi rock band the Windy Side of Care and Spondon, the folk rock music came back when [[Dalchhut]] proved their respect and ability to do folk song as a rock band in Bangladesh, with their first three albums ''Ah'' (1997), ''Hridoypur'' (2000) and ''Akashchuri'' (2002). [[Aurthohin]], was formed mainly as a heavy metal band, but composed folk rock hits like: \"Adbhut Shei Cheleti\" and \"Amar Protichhobi\". Frontman [[Sumon (musician)|Saidus Salehin Sumon]] also composed folk rock songs as a solo artists, his debut solo album ''Sumon O Aurthohin'' was one of the first folk rock albums in the country. Aurthohin's first few records are considered to be the first pure folk rock records in Bangladesh as they used rock instruments in their songs. \n\nThe folk rock music gradually changed in the mid-2000s, when [[Bangla (band)|Bangla]] started composing [[Lalon]] songs as a band. The Lalon inspired folk rock began when they released their debut album ''Kingkortobbobimurho'' in 2002. Their attitude toward the conservative Bangladeshi people impacted the teenagers and along with many bands of that era they were protesting against the conservative religious leaders and politicians. Many bands started covering Lalon geeti as they felt the need of spirituality through his philosophy and drugs. [[Lalon Band]] and [[Shayan Chowdhury Arnob|Arnob]] etc. are some successful artists who performed Lalon songs. Even renowned rock musician [[Ayub Bachchu]] was inspired to do folk songs by these bands and released ''Vatir Gane Matir Tane'' (2006), a [[Abdul Alim (folk singer)|Abdul Alim]] cover album. The folk rock scene later influenced successful bands like [[Chirkutt]] and [[Shironamhin]], who were experimenting with many rock genres, mainly with classical, rock and folk. \n\nWith an indiscriminate history, it was not very clear to tell what was the most perfect decade for Bangladeshi rock, which led to a feud between musicians Saidus Salehin Sumon and Ayub Bachchu. It began in the late 1990s, after Sumon's first solo release, when Ayub Bachchu said \"Sumon was nothing new in the rock music of Bangladesh\". The feud started as Sumon also replied saying that \"We don't need no Ayub Bachchu in our band\". There's also a rumour that Sumon said, the 2000s were the most productive phase in Bangladeshi music.\n\n===Alternative music===\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the American and British [[Alternative music|alternative]] bands were influencing several young bands in Bangladesh, which were clearly found in the late 1990s and early 2000s [[Alternative rock|alternative rock]]. Alternative bands fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound, and made heavy use of guitar [[Distortion|distortion]], [[Distortion|fuzz]] and [[Audio feedback|feedback]]. The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often wrote songs about political hypocrisy, [[Identity crisis|identity crisis]] and war criminals of Bangladesh .\n\nAround 1998, Kopropholia, Clover Minds and the Spanking Monkeys began playing alternative rock in Dhaka. These Alternative bands with their distinctive sound and casual fashion didn't enjoy too much success in the late -90s<ref>{{cite news |title=Underground |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/2010/10/03/centre.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>. They found their way to the top, when music producers like Isha Khan Duray, Warfaze guitarist [[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] started producing some albums. ''Shopnochura 1'' and ''Shopnochura 2'' are considered to be the main reason for the rise of alternative bands. Several young bands found success as the albums were sold quite well. [[Black (Bangladeshi band)|Black]] were one of the most influencing band in the scene, as the [[Radiohead]] sound had a big impact on them, they influenced the 2010s post-grunge bands. The alternative music was gaining more popularity gradually from 2003 to 2007, when [[Aurthohin]]'s ''[[Aurthohin|Dhurbok]]'' (2003), Black's ''[[Utshober Por]]'' (2003), [[Arbovirus]]' ''64m 53s'' (2006) and Vibe's ''Chena Jogot'' (2007) was selling thousands of copies in the whole country. [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]] along with their protest lyrics and sound climbed their way to the top and made alternative rock an important part of the Bangladeshi rock scene, when two songs from their debut album ''Onneshon'', \"Dhushor Bhabna\" and \"Joyodhoni\" reached the \"[[Radio Foorti]] Top 100 Songs\" chart in 2006. Bands from the alternative scene still remains popular throughout the country, but few successful bands from the genre broke and started popularizing genres such as [[Nu metal|nu metal]] and [[Post-grunge|post-grunge]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Legacy Of Bangladeshi Rock and Roll |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends |publisher=dhakatribune.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>.\n\nShohortoli, Meghdol, Defy and Ashes are four alternative bands that emerged in the scene between the late 2000s to mid 2010s. They mostly composed songs with acoustic instruments. Their lyrics were inspired by the use of [[Marijuana|marijuana]] and influenced the late 2010s rock bands heavily. Shohortoli and Meghdol were formed in [[Dhaka]] in the mid -00s, their lyrics were poetic and composed songs in an artistic way inspired by the music of [[Arnob]]. Shohortoli's most popular track \"Jelkhanar Chithi\", was a nine minute [[Spoken word|spoken word]] song, sometimes considered to be the first one of this genre. Defy and Ashes were both from [[Chittagong]], and was purely writing marijuana inspired songs and earned huge popularity by the mid -10s, when Defy released their album ''Obak Obhijan'' and Ashes released ''Charpoka''<ref>{{cite news |title=BANDS WHO ARE ABOUT TO BRING GOOD MUSIC |url=https://medium.com/@humanotrobot/bangladeshi-rock-bands-who-are-about-to-bring-some-good-music-21f234095542 |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>.\n\n===Experimental===\n\n[[File:Arnab in Dallas,2012B (1 of 1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Arnob]] pictured in 2012, while performing in Dallas, Texas.]]\n\nExperimental rock is the mixture of rock with classical music of different culture. The first experimental rock in Bangladesh is thought to be started by [[Shayan Chowdhury Arnob|Arnob]] in the mid -00s. Experimental bands in Bangladesh sometimes used [[Distortion|distortion]] in electric guitar, along with multiple instruments of different culture like: [[Sitar|sitar]], [[Esraj|esraj]], [[Tabla|tabla]], [[Harmonium|harmonium]] and [[Flute|flute]]. The artists of this genre usually writes songs based on [[Romanticism|romanticism]] and their lyrics are often considered to be poetic. \n\nArnob with his visual arts education from [[Visva Bharati University]] and [[Shironamhin]] with their poetic songs began to develop Bangladeshi rock in an artistic manner, and soon got huge success as both artists sold half a million copies of their albums and was soon being considered one of the greatest of the decade. Most of Arnob's early works were considered to be [[Folk|folk]] or some kind of [[Fusion (music)|fusion]], his most experimental album was ''[[Arnob & Friends Live]]'' (2009), which contained songs from his world tour in 2008. Arnob and Shironamhin, these two artists were also the first to release a [[Rabindra Sangeet|Rabindra sangeet]] album as a rock artists. Shironamhin released ''[[Shironamhin Rabindranath]]'' in 2010 and Arnob released ''[[Adheko Ghume]]'' in 2012. Before this scene, Bangladeshi rock musicians neither did feel the need of being artistic or being philosophical. This particular artists were somehow inspiring the generation along with folk rock musicians in starting a cultural movement in the country to protest against the conservatism of religious leaders and politicians. The popularity of experimented music still remains but, the artists have gone in different directions, with Arnob taking a break from music and Shironamhin who went on to release alternative metal songs. [[Chirkutt]] are the only band doing experimental rock in the 2010s. They tour heavily, mostly perform in stadiums and they also have developed the [[Arena rock|arena rock]] along with other bands like, Arbovirus and Nemesis. Though many young people had lost interest in the genre in the early -10s, their has been a renewed interest in the genre.\n\n==New millenium (late 2000s to mid 2010s)==\n\n===Progressive and experimental metal===\n\n[[File: Artcell (57).jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Artcell]] was the most important and most popular band from the [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] genre.]]\n\nDuring the mid -00s folk and alternative rock scene, few [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] bands were forming and performing in club shows in [[Dhaka]]. The progressive metal bands were inspired by the 90s heavy metal and 00s experimental rock bands. They developed a sound out of heavy metal, playing heavier [[Guitar riff|riffs]], [[Bassline|faster basslines]] and [[Double-bass drum|double bass drumming]], mixing with experimental rock. Their lyrics typically highlight anger about social injustice and hypocrisy and also writes philosophical songs with softer tones. \n\n[[Artcell]] was the band leading this genre and is responsible for popularizing it. Their first two studio albums, ''[[Onno Shomoy]]'' (2006) and ''Oniket Prantor'' (2008) have had a big influence in the 2010s heavy metal scene of Bangladesh than their predecessors. The theme that Artcell used in their songwriting has impacted and changed the band music of Bangladesh. Alternative metal band Vibe also had a few progressive metal numbers in their album, ''Chena Jogot'' in 2007. By the end of the decade, Artcell had stopped releasing albums, which caused the decline of progressive metal and the increasing popularity of [[Symphonic metal|symphonic metal]] and [[Experimental metal|experimental metal]]. Both of these genres derived from prog-metal. Symphonic metal and experimental of the 2010s were mainly making prog-metal, but with more orchestration and keyboards. Successful bands from this genre included, [[De-illumination]], [[Warfaze]]'s late -00s and early -10s work, Sazzad Arefeen's Angry Machine and Ionic Bond, the latter mainly being a [[Melodic death metal|melodic death metal]] band. Bay of Bengal is considered the only experimental metal band in Bangladesh, their use of different instruments in metal music, along with their heavy riffs and guitar solos made them a successful band by the release of their debut album, ''Nirob Durbikkho'' (2016).  While rock music are still heavily heard throughout the country, a budding indie scene started to flourish in smaller concert arenas. Bands like the Crowd, Embers in Snow, Pieket, Orfred, Headline, and Attic, to name a few have brought about a change in the sound of rock with, English songwriting being a common practice in their music. During the early 2010s, the Bangladesh Musical Bands Association (BAMBA) and the Chittagong Musical Bands Association (CMBA) began organising rock concerts in the city<ref>{{cite news |title=NSR IV rocks Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/feature_nsr.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>, which gave exposure to local underground bands. This resulted to the emergence of new rock bands in the city, such as Hemorrhage and Blunderware.<ref>{{cite news |title=Silent tears of underground music in Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/03/04/feature_silent.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi music scene has been changed a lot for couple of years. Many [[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] and [[Experimental metal|experimental metal]] bands have come up with new genre and new sound which people have not experienced before. Bands like Karnival and Owned have made an exceptional example of progressing the industry. Although the market is growing slowly, they already have created their own ground. Karnival released their three successful albums; whereas Owned has given two exceptional albums to the listeners. Eclipse is one of the finest band who have successfully moved with symphonic rock musical patterns. Following the unique trends, some bands like Messianic Era, Seventh Sign, Jogot, Attic; are moving forward with dedication. By the end of the decade, Bangladeshi rock saw a resurgence of [[Hard rock|hard rock]] and [[alternative rock|alternative rock]], with bands like Unmaad, the Conclusion, Adverb and the Perfect Criminals releasing successful albums.\n\n===\"Decline\"===\n\nMany criticizers and musicians have claimed that just like the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], rock music had lost it's popularity in Bangladesh during the 2010s. Partly, it has lost ground to [[Bollywood]] music from neighboring India, with its colorful power anthems celebrating life and love. Bollywood songs dominates Bangladeshi radio, and pirated versions are available online for free. Bollywood music even influenced the music [[Dhallywood]], which saw the rise of pop singers like: [[Arfin Rumey]], [[Hridoy Khan]], [[Imran Mahmudul]] and Armaan Alif. Meanwhile, an underground [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] scene has largely replaced rock as the most popular genre among the young. Domestic law has also failed to protect the financial interests of the artists who once drove Bangladesh\u2019s vibrant rock scene. Record industries say that just 10 percent of music in Bangladesh is purchased legally and estimate that music piracy annually costs US$180 million in lost earnings. Increased religiosity, which rejects all things Western in favor of a traditional lifestyle, has also hurt Bangladesh's rock scene. Some young Muslims in Bangladesh even see rock music as a sin. The trend of a band's solo concert has lost it's popularity, as concerts like Joy Bangla Concert and [[RockNation]] has become popular and sells thousand of tickets easily. The solo band concert has now lost it's popularity as these concerts get popular every year. Though losing it's popularity, throughout the 2010s, some rock bands, such as: [[Love Runs Blind]], [[James (musician)|Nagar Baul]],  [[Warfaze]], [[Aurthohin]], [[Artcell]], [[Shironamhin]] and [[Chirkut]] still remains heavily popular.\n\n===Extreme metal===\n\n[[File:Powersurge (4039954420).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Powersurge was the leader of the East Bengal extreme metal scene. Pictured in 2008, Saimum Hasan Nahian (left) and Samir Hafiz (right) in a concert.]]\n\nExtreme metal mainly being an underground genre, got commercial success in Bangladesh in the late 2000s, when [[Powersurge (band)|Powersurge]] and Mechanix took part in D-Rock Star 2008. In that competition Powersurge finished in the first place and Mechanix in the second. These two bands was the main powerhouse of extreme metal of Bangladesh. With these two bands introducing [[Thrash metal|thrash]] and [[Groove metal|groove]] metal to a wider range of audience, [[Severe Dementia (band)|Severe Dementia]] had introduced [[Death metal|death]] few years before them. Death metal vocals usually delivered as guttural \"[[Death growls|death growls]]\", high-pitched [[Screaming|screaming]], complemented by downtuned, highly [[Distortion|distorted]] guitars and extremely fast [[Bass drum|double bass]] percussion. These extreme metal bands had no intention of getting commercial success, as they were all fans of the underground extreme metal of the 1980s. These three bands are considered to be the pioneers of the East Bengal extreme metal. Introducing a different kind of style and sound in the Bangladeshi rock scene, these bands were criticized hardly for the horrific images in their album covers. Other important extreme metal bands in this decade includes: Minerva, Dissector, Thrash, Trainwreck and Nafaarmaan. In 2018, Saimum Hasan Nahian, the guitarist of pioneering extreme metal band Powersurge, urged the [[Wacken Open Air]] authorities to hold a concert in Bangladesh, to promote the talented metal bands of Bangladesh. The Wacken Metal Battle concert was held in the Russian Cultural Center, Dhaka where five metal bands: Karma, Ionic Bond, Torture Goregrinder, Infidel and Trainwreck took part in the competition, and the latter band was the winner. They performed in the [[Bangalore Open Air]], where they won against other metal bands from [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[India]], which got them the ticket to the Wacken Open Air as the first Bangladeshi band.\n\n== Notable bands of Bangladesh ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

But even after the war, the North Korean leadership urged women to continue participating actively in the reconstruction of society. The practical social demand created the need for a female labor force and thus women's emancipation from the domestic sphere was legitimized under the pretext of \"achieving gender equality.\" As Hunter points out: \"In 1947, only 5 percent of industrial workers were women; by 1949, the number had jumped to 15 percent.

The imagined family was deemed by the degree of commitment to ideological and political struggle, which separated \"us\" from the \"enemy.\" Thus, imagining a family was perceived as a process of liberating women and motivating them to have a larger social presence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Kyung Ae|title=Women and Social Change in South and North Korea: Marxist and Liberal Perspectives|journal=Women and International Development|date=June 1992}}</ref>\nThe colonial experience under occupation by the [[Japan]]ese, who were traditionally despised as \"barbarians,\" propelled Koreans to evaluate their weakness vis-\u00e0-vis the concrete threat to their national [[sovereignty]]. Women's backwardness was regarded as directly related to national weakness. In light of their nation's fragile future, Koreans thought women's backwardness to stem from the traditional family life, one of the most ancient institutions in [[Korean society]].<ref name=\"SukYoung\" /> Women joined the labor front upon the outbreak of the Korean War. As manpower was concentrated on warfare, industry, and agriculture were left to women's care. But even after the war, the North Korean leadership urged women to continue participating actively in the reconstruction of society. The practical social demand created the need for a female labor force and thus women's emancipation from the domestic sphere was legitimized under the pretext of \"achieving gender equality.\" As Hunter points out: \"In 1947, only 5 percent of industrial workers were women; by 1949, the number had jumped to 15 percent. By 1967, women accounted for almost half of the total workforce.\"<ref name=\"SukYoung\" />\nNorth Korea is a fashion-conscious nation where [[political leaders]] strive to dress its people through rigid regulations, imposing uniforms on various social sectors and systematically recommending certain designs to civilians. \nSome other socialist and authoritarian states glorified masculine clothing as a preferred means to represent revolutionized women.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.
