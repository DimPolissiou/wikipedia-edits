He made [[Cartography|detailed maps]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the first recorded circumnavigation of [[New Zealand]].\n\nCook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the [[Seven Years' War]] and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|siege of Quebec]], which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and [[Royal Society]]. This acclaim came at a crucial moment in his career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of {{ship|HM Bark|Endeavour}} for the first of three Pacific voyages.\n\nIn these voyages, Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously charted by Western explorers. He surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage, and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions.\n\nCook was attacked and killed in 1779 during his third exploratory voyage in the Pacific while [[Kidnapping of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu by Captain James Cook|attempting to kidnap]] the [[Island of Hawaii|Island of Hawaii's]]  monarch, [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]], in order to reclaim a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] stolen from one of his ships.  He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge that influenced his successors well into the 20th&nbsp;century, and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him.\n\n==Early life and family==\nJames Cook was born on 7 November 1728 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]) in the village of [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]] in Yorkshire and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the [[parish church]] of [[Marton, Middlesbrough#St Cuthbert's Church|St Cuthbert]], where his name can be seen in the church register.<ref name=\"Rigby25\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2009|p=2}}</ref> He was the second of eight children of James Cook (1693\u20131779), a Scottish farm labourer from [[Ednam]] in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace (1702\u20131765), from [[Thornaby-on-Tees]].<ref name=\"Rigby25\">{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=25}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Stamp|1978|p=1}}</ref><ref name=\"collingridge\">{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003}}</ref> In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at [[Great Ayton]], where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school.

At this time, Cook employed local pilots to point out the \"rocks and hidden dangers\" along the south and west coasts. During the 1765 season, four pilots were engaged at a daily pay of 4 [[shilling]]s each: John Beck for the coast west of \"[[St. Lawrence, Newfoundland and Labrador|Great St Lawrence]]\", Morgan Snook for [[Fortune Bay]], John Dawson for Connaigre and [[Hermitage Bay]], and John Peck for the \"[[Bay d'Espoir|Bay of Despair]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/cns/JamesCookInNewfoundland1762_1767.pdf|title=James Cook in Newfoundland 1762\u20131767|first=William|last=Whiteley|year=1975 |accessdate=27 August 2012 |work=Newfoundland Historical Society Pamphlet Number 3}}</ref>\n\nWhile in Newfoundland, Cook also conducted astronomical observations, in particular of the eclipse of the sun on 5 August 1766.

The trip's principal goal was to locate a [[Northwest Passage]] around the American continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=327}}</ref> After dropping Omai at Tahiti, Cook travelled north and in 1778 became the first European to begin formal contact with the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref name=\"Fish2011\">{{cite book|first=Shirley|last=Fish|title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons : The Treasure Ships of the Pacific: With An Annotated List of the Transpacific Galleons 1565\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk_iU0f-iT8C&pg=PA360|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-7543-8|pages=360\u2013}}</ref> After his initial landfall in January 1778 at [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]] harbour, [[Kauai]], Cook named the [[archipelago]] the \"Sandwich Islands\" after the [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|fourth Earl of Sandwich]]\u2014the acting [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=380}}</ref>\n\n===North America===\nFrom the Sandwich Islands, Cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in [[Alta California]]. He sighted the Oregon coast at approximately 44\u00b030\u2032 north latitude, naming [[Cape Foulweather]], after the bad weather which forced his ships south to about [[43rd parallel north|43\u00b0 north]] before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1999|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> He unknowingly sailed past the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] and soon after entered [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]]. He anchored near the [[First Nations]] village of [[Yuquot, British Columbia|Yuquot]]. Cook's two ships remained in Nootka Sound from 29 March to 26 April 1778, in what Cook called Ship Cove, now Resolution Cove,<ref>{{cite bcgnis|18990|Resolution Cove|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> at the south end of [[Bligh Island (Canada)|Bligh Island]]. Relations between Cook's crew and the people of Yuquot were cordial but sometimes strained. In trading, the people of Yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had been acceptable in Hawaii. Metal objects were much desired, but the lead, pewter, and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute. The most valuable items which the British received in trade were [[sea otter]] pelts. During the stay, the Yuquot \"hosts\" essentially controlled the trade with the British vessels; the natives usually visited the British vessels at Resolution Cove instead of the British visiting the village of Yuquot at Friendly Cove.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fisher|1979}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Nootka Sound, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the [[Bering Strait]], on the way identifying what came to be known as [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska. In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American northwest coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the west) and Spanish (from the south) exploratory probes of the northern limits of the Pacific.<ref name=\"G_Williams\" />\n\n[[File:John Cleveley the Younger, Views of the South Seas (No. 3 of 4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|HMS ''Resolution'' and ''Discovery'' in Tahiti]]\n\nBy the second week of August 1778, Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the [[Chukchi Sea]]. He headed northeast up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice at a latitude of 70\u00b044\u2032 north. Cook then sailed west to the [[Siberia]]n coast, and then southeast down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778 he was back in the [[Bering Sea]] to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life of Captain James Cook|first=John Cawte|last=Beaglehole|date=1974|publisher=A & C Black|isbn=978-0-7136-1382-7|pages=615\u201323}}</ref> He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat [[walrus]] meat, which they had pronounced inedible.<ref name=\"seven\" />\n\n===Return to Hawaii===\nCook returned to Hawaii in 1779. After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai'i Island]], largest island in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]]. Cook's arrival coincided with the ''[[Makahiki]]'', a Hawaiian [[harvest festival]] of worship for the Polynesian god [[Lono]]. Coincidentally the form of Cook's ship, HMS ''Resolution'', or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship.<ref name=\"collingridge\" /><ref name=\"seven\" /> Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals. It has been argued (most extensively by [[Marshall Sahlins]]) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook's (and to a limited extent, his crew's) initial [[Apotheosis|deification]] by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono.<ref name=\"Sahlins1985\">{{harvnb|Sahlins|1985}}</ref> Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook's expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, were challenged in 1992.<ref name=\"seven\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1992}}</ref><ref name=\"2nd ed\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1997}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main|Kidnapping of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu by Captain James Cook}}\n\nAfter a month's stay, Cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, however, ''Resolution''{{'}}s foremast broke, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs.\n\nTensions rose, and a number of quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay.

Cook took the king ([[Ali'i|ali\u02bbi nui]]) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's favourite wives, [[Kanekapolei]], and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go. An old [[kahuna]] (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore.

At that time the collection consisted of 115 artefacts collected on Cook's three voyages throughout the Pacific Ocean, during the period 1768\u201380, along with documents and memorabilia related to these voyages. Many of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] artefacts were collected at a time of first contact between [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Peoples]] and [[Europeans]]. In 1935 most of the documents and memorabilia were transferred to the Mitchell Library in the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. The provenance of the collection shows that the objects remained in the hands of Cook's widow Elizabeth Cook, and her descendants, until 1886. In this year John Mackrell, the great-nephew of [[Isaac Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Isaac Smith]], Elizabeth Cook's cousin, organised the display of this collection at the request of the NSW Government at the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] in London. In 1887 the London-based [[Agent-General]] for the New South Wales Government, Saul Samuel, bought John Mackrell's items and also acquired items belonging to the other relatives Reverend Canon Frederick Bennett, Mrs Thomas Langton, H.M.C. Alexander, and William Adams.

Navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a [[backstaff]] or [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth. The Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://science.jrank.org/pages/1304/Celestial-Sphere-Apparent-Motions-Sun-Moon-Planets-Stars.html|title= Celestial Sphere: The Apparent Motions of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars \u2013 Earth, North, Axis, Approximately, Latitude, and Equator|year= 2011|accessdate= 26 August 2011}}</ref> Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage from his navigational skills, with the help of astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]], and by using the newly published [[The Nautical Almanac|''Nautical Almanac'']] tables, via the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] method \u2013 measuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars.\n\nOn his second voyage, Cook used the K1 chronometer made by [[Larcum Kendall]], which was the shape of a large [[pocket watch]], {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter.

He made [[Cartography|detailed maps]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the first recorded circumnavigation of [[New Zealand]].\n\nCook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the [[Seven Years' War]] and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the [[Saint Lawrence River]] during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|siege of Quebec]], which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and [[Royal Society]]. This acclaim came at a crucial moment in his career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of {{ship|HM Bark|Endeavour}} for the first of three Pacific voyages.\n\nIn these voyages, Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously charted by Western explorers. He surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time.

Relations between Cook's crew and the people of Yuquot were cordial but sometimes strained. In trading, the people of Yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had been acceptable in Hawaii. Metal objects were much desired, but the lead, pewter, and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute. The most valuable items which the British received in trade were [[sea otter]] pelts. During the stay, the Yuquot \"hosts\" essentially controlled the trade with the British vessels; the natives usually visited the British vessels at Resolution Cove instead of the British visiting the village of Yuquot at Friendly Cove.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fisher|1979}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Nootka Sound, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the [[Bering Strait]], on the way identifying what came to be known as [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska. In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American northwest coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the west) and Spanish (from the south) exploratory probes of the northern limits of the Pacific.<ref name=\"G_Williams\" />\n\n[[File:John Cleveley the Younger, Views of the South Seas (No. 3 of 4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|HMS ''Resolution'' and ''Discovery'' in Tahiti]]\n\nBy the second week of August 1778, Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the [[Chukchi Sea]]. He headed northeast up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice at a latitude of 70\u00b044\u2032 north. Cook then sailed west to the [[Siberia]]n coast, and then southeast down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778 he was back in the [[Bering Sea]] to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life of Captain James Cook|first=John Cawte|last=Beaglehole|date=1974|publisher=A & C Black|isbn=978-0-7136-1382-7|pages=615\u201323}}</ref> He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat [[walrus]] meat, which they had pronounced inedible.<ref name=\"seven\" />\n\n===Return to Hawaii===\nCook returned to Hawaii in 1779. After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai'i Island]], largest island in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]]. Cook's arrival coincided with the ''[[Makahiki]]'', a Hawaiian [[harvest festival]] of worship for the Polynesian god [[Lono]]. Coincidentally the form of Cook's ship, HMS ''Resolution'', or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship.<ref name=\"collingridge\" /><ref name=\"seven\" /> Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals. It has been argued (most extensively by [[Marshall Sahlins]]) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook's (and to a limited extent, his crew's) initial [[Apotheosis|deification]] by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono.<ref name=\"Sahlins1985\">{{harvnb|Sahlins|1985}}</ref> Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook's expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, were challenged in 1992.<ref name=\"seven\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1992}}</ref><ref name=\"2nd ed\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1997}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main|Kidnapping of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu by Captain James Cook}}\n\nAfter a month's stay, Cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, however, ''Resolution''{{'}}s foremast broke, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs.\n\nTensions rose, and a number of quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay. An unknown group of Hawaiians took one of Cook's small boats.

Cook took the king ([[Ali'i|ali\u02bbi nui]]) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's favourite wives, [[Kanekapolei]], and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go.

At that time the collection consisted of 115 artefacts collected on Cook's three voyages throughout the Pacific Ocean, during the period 1768\u201380, along with documents and memorabilia related to these voyages. Many of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] artefacts were collected at a time of first contact between [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Peoples]] and [[Europeans]]. In 1935 most of the documents and memorabilia were transferred to the Mitchell Library in the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. The provenance of the collection shows that the objects remained in the hands of Cook's widow Elizabeth Cook, and her descendants, until 1886. In this year John Mackrell, the great-nephew of [[Isaac Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Isaac Smith]], Elizabeth Cook's cousin, organised the display of this collection at the request of the NSW Government at the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] in London. In 1887 the London-based [[Agent-General]] for the New South Wales Government, Saul Samuel, bought John Mackrell's items and also acquired items belonging to the other relatives Reverend Canon Frederick Bennett, Mrs Thomas Langton, H.M.C. Alexander, and William Adams.

Navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a [[backstaff]] or [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth. The Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://science.jrank.org/pages/1304/Celestial-Sphere-Apparent-Motions-Sun-Moon-Planets-Stars.html|title= Celestial Sphere: The Apparent Motions of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars \u2013 Earth, North, Axis, Approximately, Latitude, and Equator|year= 2011|accessdate= 26 August 2011}}</ref> Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage from his navigational skills, with the help of astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]], and by using the newly published [[The Nautical Almanac|''Nautical Almanac'']] tables, via the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] method \u2013 measuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars.\n\nOn his second voyage, Cook used the K1 chronometer made by [[Larcum Kendall]], which was the shape of a large [[pocket watch]], {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter. It was a copy of the [[Harrison Number Four|H4]] clock made by [[John Harrison]], which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship ''Deptford''{{'}}s journey to [[Jamaica]] in 1761\u201362.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://dl.nfsa.gov.au/module/1318/|title= Captain Cook \u2013 Cook's Chronometer \u2013 English and Media Literacy, Documentaries|work= dl.nfsa.gov.au|year= 2011|accessdate= 8 August 2011}}</ref> He succeeded in circumnavigating the world on his first voyage without losing a single man to [[scurvy]], an unusual accomplishment at the time.

Apparent FTL is not excluded by [[general relativity]]; however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the [[Alcubierre drive]] and the [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Superluminal travel of non-information==\n{{main|Superluminal motion}}\n\nIn the context of this article, FTL is the transmission of information or matter faster than ''c'', a constant equal to the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, which is 299,792,458&nbsp;m/s (by definition of the meter) or about 186,282.397 miles per second. This is not quite the same as traveling faster than light, since:\n*Some processes propagate faster than ''c'', but cannot carry information (see examples in the sections immediately following).\n*In some materials where light travels at speed ''c/n'' (where ''n'' is the [[refractive index]]) other particles can travel faster than ''c/n'' (but still slower than ''c''), leading to [[Cherenkov radiation]] (see phase velocity below).\nNeither of these phenomena violates [[special relativity]] or creates problems with [[causality]], and thus neither qualifies as ''FTL'' as described here.\n\nIn the following examples, certain influences may appear to travel faster than light, but they do not convey energy or information faster than light, so they do not violate special relativity.\n\n===Daily sky motion===\nFor an earth-bound observer, objects in the sky complete one revolution around the Earth in one day. [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star outside the [[Solar System]], is about four [[light-year]]s away.<ref name=\"A2 Student Book\">\n{{cite book\n|author=University of York Science Education Group\n|year=2001\n|title=Salter Horners Advanced Physics A2 Student Book\n|publisher=Heinemann\n|pages=302\u2013303\n|isbn=978-0435628925\n}}</ref> In this frame of reference, in which Proxima Centauri is perceived to be moving in a circular trajectory with a radius of four light years, it could be described as having a speed many times greater than ''c'' as the rim speed of an object moving in a circle is a product of the radius and angular speed.<ref name=\"A2 Student Book\"/> It is also possible on a [[geostatic orbit|geostatic]] view, for objects such as comets to vary their speed from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa simply because the distance from the Earth varies. Comets may have orbits which take them out to more than 1000 [[astronomical unit|AU]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|date=15 April 1996\n|title=The Furthest Object in the Solar System\n|url=http://www.oarval.org/furthest.htm\n|work=Information Leaflet No. 55\n|publisher=Royal Greenwich Observatory\n}}</ref> The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1000 AU is greater than one light day. In other words, a comet at such a distance is superluminal in a geostatic, and therefore non-inertial, frame.\n\n===Light spots and shadows===\nIf a laser beam is swept across a distant object, the spot of laser light can easily be made to move across the object at a speed greater than ''c''.<ref name=\"Gibbs\"/> Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move across the object faster than ''c''.<ref name=\"Gibbs\">\n{{cite web\n|last=Gibbs |first=P.\n|year=1997\n|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html\n|title=Is Faster-Than-Light Travel or Communication Possible?\n|work=The Original Usenet Physics FAQ\n|accessdate=20 August 2008\n}}</ref> In neither case does the light travel from the source to the object faster than ''c'', nor does any information travel faster than light.<ref name=\"Gibbs\"/><ref>\n{{cite book\n|last1=Salmon |first1=W.

This may approach twice the speed of light, as in the case of two particles travelling at close to the speed of light in opposite directions with respect to the reference frame.\n\nImagine two fast-moving particles approaching each other from opposite sides of a [[particle accelerator]] of the collider type. The closing speed would be the rate at which the distance between the two particles is decreasing. From the point of view of an observer standing at rest relative to the accelerator, this rate will be slightly less than twice the speed of light.\n\n[[Special relativity]] does not prohibit this. It tells us that it is wrong to use [[Galilean relativity]] to compute the velocity of one of the particles, as would be measured by an observer traveling alongside the other particle. That is, special relativity gives the correct [[velocity-addition formula]] for computing such [[relative velocity]].\n\nIt is instructive to compute the relative velocity of particles moving at ''v'' and \u2212''v'' in accelerator frame, which corresponds to the closing speed of 2''v''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''c''. Expressing the speeds in units of ''c'', \u03b2&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c'':\n:<math>\\beta_\\text{rel} = \\frac{\\beta + \\beta}{1 + \\beta ^2} = \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\leq 1.</math>\n\n===Proper speeds===\nIf a spaceship travels to a planet one light-year (as measured in the Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be less than one year as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a [[proper velocity]]. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth at the same time as the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.\n\n===Possible distance away from Earth===\n{{Main|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\nSince one might not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then never be able to reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20\u201340 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of [[time dilation]], the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1&nbsp;g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the [[speed of light]] (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the [[Solar System]], but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, they will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed ''c'', their [[proper velocity|proper speed]] (distance as seen by Earth divided by their [[proper time]]) can be much greater than ''c''. This is seen in statistical studies of [[muon]]s traveling much further than ''c'' times their [[half-life]] (at rest), if traveling close to ''c''.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last1=Sartori |first1=L.\n|year=1976\n|title=Understanding Relativity: A Simplified Approach to Einstein's Theories\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gV6kgxrZjL8C\n|publisher=[[University of California Press]]\n|pages=79\u201383\n|isbn=978-0-520-91624-1\n}}</ref>\n\n===Phase velocities above ''c''===\nThe [[phase velocity]] of an [[electromagnetic wave]], when traveling through a medium, can routinely exceed ''c'', the vacuum velocity of light.

The latter association has been shown to be misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives.

[[Wavefunction collapse]] can be viewed as an [[epiphenomenon]] of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and ''all'' of its environment. Since the underlying behavior does not violate local causality or allow FTL communication, it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real ''or'' apparent.\n\nThe [[uncertainty principle]] implies that individual photons may travel for short distances at speeds somewhat faster (or slower) than ''c'', even in a vacuum; this possibility must be taken into account when enumerating [[Feynman diagram]]s for a particle interaction.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last1=Grozin |first1=A.\n|year=2007\n|title=Lectures on QED and QCD\n|page=89\n|publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n|isbn=978-981-256-914-1\n}}</ref> However, it was shown in 2011 that a single photon may not travel faster than ''c''.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last1=Zhang |first1=S.\n|last2=Chen |first2=J.

This is sometimes described in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, owing to the mathematical form of one possible way of calculating the strength of the effect. Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small. Because the effect is due to virtual particles mediating a static field effect, it is subject to the comments about static fields discussed above.\n\n====EPR paradox====\n{{Main|EPR paradox}}\n\nThe EPR paradox refers to a famous [[thought experiment]] of [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] that was realized experimentally for the first time by [[Alain Aspect]] in 1981 and 1982 in the [[Aspect experiment]]. In this experiment, the measurement of the state of one of the quantum systems of an [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] pair apparently instantaneously forces the other system (which may be distant) to be measured in the complementary state. However, no information can be transmitted this way; the answer to whether or not the measurement actually affects the other quantum system comes down to which [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] one subscribes to.\n\nAn experiment performed in 1997 by [[Nicolas Gisin]] has demonstrated non-local quantum correlations between particles separated by over 10 kilometers.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|last=Suarez |first=A.\n|date=26 February 2015\n|title=History\n|url=http://www.quantumphil.org/history.htm\n|publisher=Center for Quantum Philosophy\n|accessdate=2017-06-07\n}}</ref> But as noted earlier, the non-local correlations seen in entanglement cannot actually be used to transmit classical information faster than light, so that relativistic causality is preserved. The situation is akin to sharing a synchronized coin flip, where the second person to flip their coin will always see the opposite of what the first person sees, but neither has any way of knowing whether they were the first or second flipper, without communicating classically. See [[No-communication theorem]] for further information. A 2008 quantum physics experiment also performed by Nicolas Gisin and his colleagues has determined that in any hypothetical [[hidden-variable theory#Non-local hidden-variable theory|non-local hidden-variable theory]], the speed of the [[quantum non-local connection]] (what Einstein called \"spooky action at a distance\") is at least 10,000 times the speed of light.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last1=Salart |first1=D.\n|last2=Baas |first2=A.\n|last3=Branciard |first3=C.\n|last4=Gisin |first4=N.\n|last5=Zbinden |first5=H.\n|year=2008\n|title=Testing spooky action at a distance\n|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n|volume=454 |issue=7206 |pages=861\u2013864\n|arxiv=0808.3316\n|bibcode=2008Natur.454..861S\n|doi=10.1038/nature07121\n|pmid=18704081\n}}</ref>\n\n====Delayed choice quantum eraser====\n{{Main|Delayed-choice quantum eraser}}\n\nThe [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] is a version of the EPR paradox in which the observation (or not) of interference after the passage of a photon through a [[double slit experiment]] depends on the conditions of observation of a second photon entangled with the first.

What we measure as the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum (or near vacuum) is actually the fundamental physical constant ''c''. This means that all [[inertial]] observers, regardless of their relative [[velocity]], will always measure zero-mass particles such as [[photon]]s traveling at ''c'' in a vacuum. This result means that measurements of time and velocity in different frames are no longer related simply by constant shifts, but are instead related by [[Poincar\u00e9 transformation]]s. These transformations have important implications:\n*The relativistic momentum of a [[mass]]ive particle would increase with speed in such a way that at the speed of light an object would have infinite momentum.\n*To accelerate an object of non-zero [[mass in special relativity|rest mass]] to ''c'' would require infinite time with any finite acceleration, or infinite acceleration for a finite amount of time.\n*Either way, such acceleration requires infinite energy.\n*Some observers with sub-light relative motion will disagree about which occurs first of any two events that are separated by a [[spacetime interval|space-like interval]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Einstein |first=A.\n|year=1927\n|title=Relativity:the special and the general theory\n|publisher=Methuen & Co\n|pages=25\u201327\n}}</ref> In other words, any travel that is faster-than-light will be seen as traveling backwards in time in some other, equally valid, frames of reference,<ref>\n{{cite web\n|last=Odenwald |first=S.\n|date=\n|title=If we could travel faster than light, could we go back in time?\n|url=http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/relativity/q295.html\n|work=NASA Astronomy Caf\u00e9\n|accessdate=7 April 2014\n}}</ref> or need to assume the speculative hypothesis of possible Lorentz violations at a presently unobserved scale (for instance the Planck scale).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Therefore, any theory which permits \"true\" FTL also has to cope with [[time travel]] and all its associated paradoxes,<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Gott |first=J.

It maintains the principle that no object can accelerate to the speed of light in the reference frame of any coincident observer.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, it permits distortions in [[spacetime]] that allow an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant observer.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} One such [[distortion]] is the [[Alcubierre drive]], which can be thought of as producing a ripple in [[spacetime]] that carries an object along with it. Another possible system is the [[wormhole]], which connects two distant locations as though by a shortcut. Both distortions would need to create a very strong curvature in a highly localized region of space-time and their gravity fields would be immense. To counteract the unstable nature, and prevent the distortions from collapsing under their own 'weight', one would need to introduce hypothetical [[exotic matter]] or negative energy.\n\nGeneral relativity also recognizes that any means of faster-than-light [[travel]] could also be used for [[time travel]]. This raises problems with [[causality]]. Many physicists believe that the above phenomena are impossible and that future theories of [[gravity]] will prohibit them. One theory states that stable wormholes are possible, but that any attempt to use a network of wormholes to violate causality would result in their decay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In [[string theory]], Eric G.

Apparent FTL is not excluded by [[general relativity]]; however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the [[Alcubierre drive]] and the [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Superluminal travel of non-information==\n{{main|Superluminal motion}}\n\nIn the context of this article, FTL is the transmission of information or matter faster than ''c'', a constant equal to the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, which is 299,792,458&nbsp;m/s (by definition of the meter) or about 186,282.397 miles per second. This is not quite the same as traveling faster than light, since:\n*Some processes propagate faster than ''c'', but cannot carry information (see examples in the sections immediately following).\n*In some materials where light travels at speed ''c/n'' (where ''n'' is the [[refractive index]]) other particles can travel faster than ''c/n'' (but still slower than ''c''), leading to [[Cherenkov radiation]] (see phase velocity below).\nNeither of these phenomena violates [[special relativity]] or creates problems with [[causality]], and thus neither qualifies as ''FTL'' as described here.\n\nIn the following examples, certain influences may appear to travel faster than light, but they do not convey energy or information faster than light, so they do not violate special relativity.\n\n===Daily sky motion===\nFor an earth-bound observer, objects in the sky complete one revolution around the Earth in one day. [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star outside the [[Solar System]], is about four [[light-year]]s away.<ref name=\"A2 Student Book\">\n{{cite book\n|author=University of York Science Education Group\n|year=2001\n|title=Salter Horners Advanced Physics A2 Student Book\n|publisher=Heinemann\n|pages=302\u2013303\n|isbn=978-0435628925\n}}</ref> In this frame of reference, in which Proxima Centauri is perceived to be moving in a circular trajectory with a radius of four light years, it could be described as having a speed many times greater than ''c'' as the rim speed of an object moving in a circle is a product of the radius and angular speed.<ref name=\"A2 Student Book\"/> It is also possible on a [[geostatic orbit|geostatic]] view, for objects such as comets to vary their speed from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa simply because the distance from the Earth varies.

This may approach twice the speed of light, as in the case of two particles travelling at close to the speed of light in opposite directions with respect to the reference frame.\n\nImagine two fast-moving particles approaching each other from opposite sides of a [[particle accelerator]] of the collider type. The closing speed would be the rate at which the distance between the two particles is decreasing. From the point of view of an observer standing at rest relative to the accelerator, this rate will be slightly less than twice the speed of light.\n\n[[Special relativity]] does not prohibit this. It tells us that it is wrong to use [[Galilean relativity]] to compute the velocity of one of the particles, as would be measured by an observer traveling alongside the other particle. That is, special relativity gives the correct [[velocity-addition formula]] for computing such [[relative velocity]].\n\nIt is instructive to compute the relative velocity of particles moving at ''v'' and \u2212''v'' in accelerator frame, which corresponds to the closing speed of 2''v''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''c''. Expressing the speeds in units of ''c'', \u03b2&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c'':\n:<math>\\beta_\\text{rel} = \\frac{\\beta + \\beta}{1 + \\beta ^2} = \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\leq 1.</math>\n\n===Proper speeds===\nIf a spaceship travels to a planet one light-year (as measured in the Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be less than one year as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a [[proper velocity]]. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth at the same time as the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.\n\n===Possible distance away from Earth===\n{{Main|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\nSince one might not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then never be able to reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20\u201340 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of [[time dilation]], the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1&nbsp;g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the [[speed of light]] (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the [[Solar System]], but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, they will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed ''c'', their [[proper velocity|proper speed]] (distance as seen by Earth divided by their [[proper time]]) can be much greater than ''c''. This is seen in statistical studies of [[muon]]s traveling much further than ''c'' times their [[half-life]] (at rest), if traveling close to ''c''.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last1=Sartori |first1=L.\n|year=1976\n|title=Understanding Relativity: A Simplified Approach to Einstein's Theories\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gV6kgxrZjL8C\n|publisher=[[University of California Press]]\n|pages=79\u201383\n|isbn=978-0-520-91624-1\n}}</ref>\n\n===Phase velocities above ''c''===\nThe [[phase velocity]] of an [[electromagnetic wave]], when traveling through a medium, can routinely exceed ''c'', the vacuum velocity of light.

The latter association has been shown to be misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives.

It maintains the principle that no object can accelerate to the speed of light in the reference frame of any coincident observer.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, it permits distortions in [[spacetime]] that allow an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant observer.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} One such [[distortion]] is the [[Alcubierre drive]], which can be thought of as producing a ripple in [[spacetime]] that carries an object along with it. Another possible system is the [[wormhole]], which connects two distant locations as though by a shortcut. Both distortions would need to create a very strong curvature in a highly localized region of space-time and their gravity fields would be immense. To counteract the unstable nature, and prevent the distortions from collapsing under their own 'weight', one would need to introduce hypothetical [[exotic matter]] or negative energy.\n\nGeneral relativity also recognizes that any means of faster-than-light [[travel]] could also be used for [[time travel]]. This raises problems with [[causality]]. Many physicists believe that the above phenomena are impossible and that future theories of [[gravity]] will prohibit them. One theory states that stable wormholes are possible, but that any attempt to use a network of wormholes to violate causality would result in their decay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In [[string theory]], Eric G.

{"title_page": "Distributed constraint optimization", "text_new": "'''Distributed constraint optimization''' ('''DCOP''' or '''DisCOP''') is the [[Distributed computing|distributed]] analogue to [[constraint optimization]].  A DCOP is a problem in which a group of agents must distributedly choose values for a set of variables such that the cost\nof a set of constraints over the variables is minimized.\n\nDistributed Constraint Satisfaction is a framework for describing a problem in terms of constraints that are known and enforced by distinct participants (agents). The constraints are described on some variables with predefined domains, and have to be assigned to the same values by the different agents.\n\nProblems defined with this framework can be solved by any of the algorithms that are designed for it.\n\nThe framework was used under different names in the 1980s. The first known usage with the current name is in 1990. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===DCOP===\n\nA '''DCOP''' can be defined as a [[tuple]] <math>\\langle A, V, \\mathfrak{D}, f, \\alpha, \\eta \\rangle</math>, where:\n*<math>A</math> is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Intelligent agent|agents]];\n*<math>V</math> is a set of variables, <math>\\{v_1,v_2,\\cdots,v_{|V|}\\}</math>;\n*<math>\\mathfrak{D}</math> is a set of domains, <math>\\{D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_{|V|}\\}</math>, where each <math>D \\in \\mathfrak{D}</math> is a [[finite set]] containing the values to which its associated variable may be assigned;\n*<math>f</math> is a function<ref>\"<math>\\mathfrak{P}(\\mathfrak{V})</math>\" denotes the [[power set]] of <math>V</math></ref><ref>\"<math>\\times</math>\" and \"<math>\\sum</math>\" denote the [[Cartesian product]].</ref><center><math>f : \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathfrak{P}(V)}\\sum{v_i \\in S} \\left( \\{v_i\\} \\times D_i \\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}</math></center>that maps every possible variable assignment to a cost.  This function can also be thought of as defining constraints between variables however the variables must not be Hermitian;\n*<math>\\alpha</math> is a function <math>\\alpha: V \\rightarrow A</math> mapping variables to their associated agent.  <math>\\alpha(v_i) \\mapsto a_j</math> implies that it is agent <math>a_j</math>'s responsibility to assign the value of variable <math>v_i</math>.  Note that it is not necessarily true that <math>\\alpha</math> is either an [[Injective function|injection]] or [[surjection]]; and\n*<math>\\eta</math> is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] that aggregates all of the individual <math>f</math> costs for all possible variable assignments.  This is usually accomplished through summation:<center><math>\\eta(f) \\mapsto \\sum_{s \\in \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathfrak{P}(V)}\\sum{v_i \\in S} \\left( \\{v_i\\} \\times D_i \\right)} f(s)</math>.</center>\n\nThe objective of a DCOP is to have each agent assign values to its associated variables in order to either minimize or maximize <math>\\eta(f)</math> for a given assignment of the variables.\n\n===Context===\n\nA '''context''' is a variable assignment for a DCOP.  This can be thought of as a function mapping variables in the DCOP to their current values:<center><math>t : V \\rightarrow (D \\in \\mathfrak{D}) \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}.</math></center>  Note that a context is essentially a partial solution and need not contain values for ''every'' variable in the problem; therefore, <math>t(v_i) \\mapsto \\emptyset</math> implies that the agent <math>\\alpha(v_i)</math> has not yet assigned a value to variable <math>v_i</math>.  Given this representation, the \"[[Domain of a function|domain]]\" (''i.e.'', the set of  input values) of the function <code>f</code> can be thought of as the set of all possible contexts for the DCOP.  Therefore, in the remainder of this article we may use the notion of a context (''i.e.'', the <math>t</math> function) as an input to the <math>f</math> function.\n\n==Example problems==\n\n===Distributed graph coloring===\nThe [[graph coloring]] problem is as follows: given a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] <math>G = \\langle N, E \\rangle</math> and a set of colors <math>C</math>, assign each [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]], <math>n\\subset N</math>, a color, <math>c\\leq C</math>, such that the number of adjacent vertices with the same color is minimized.\n\nAs a DCOP, there is one agent per vertex that is assigned to decide the associated color.  Each agent has a single variable whose associated domain is of [[cardinality]] <math>|C|</math> (there is one domain value for each possible color).  For each vertex <math>n_i \\leq N</math>, create a variable in the DCOP <math>v_i \\in V</math> with domain <math>D_i = C</math>.

A DCOP is a problem in which a group of agents must distributedly choose values for a set of variables such that the cost\nof a set of constraints over the variables is minimized.\n\nDistributed Constraint Satisfaction is a framework for describing a problem in terms of constraints that are known and enforced by distinct participants (agents). The constraints are described on some variables with predefined domains, and have to be assigned to the same values by the different agents.\n\nProblems defined with this framework can be solved by any of the algorithms that are designed for it.\n\nThe framework was used under different names in the 1980s. The first known usage with the current name is in 1990. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===DCOP===\n\nA '''DCOP''' can be defined as a [[tuple]] <math>\\langle A, V, \\mathfrak{D}, f, \\alpha, \\eta \\rangle</math>, where:\n*<math>A</math> is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Intelligent agent|agents]];\n*<math>V</math> is a set of variables, <math>\\{v_1,v_2,\\cdots,v_{|V|}\\}</math>;\n*<math>\\mathfrak{D}</math> is a set of domains, <math>\\{D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_{|V|}\\}</math>, where each <math>D \\in \\mathfrak{D}</math> is a [[finite set]] containing the values to which its associated variable may be assigned;\n*<math>f</math> is a function<ref>\"<math>\\mathfrak{P}(\\mathfrak{V})</math>\" denotes the [[power set]] of <math>V</math></ref><ref>\"<math>\\times</math>\" and \"<math>\\sum</math>\" denote the [[Cartesian product]].</ref><center><math>f : \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathfrak{P}(V)}\\sum{v_i \\in S} \\left( \\{v_i\\} \\times D_i \\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}</math></center>that maps every possible variable assignment to a cost.  This function can also be thought of as defining constraints between variables however the variables must not be Hermitian;\n*<math>\\alpha</math> is a function <math>\\alpha: V \\rightarrow A</math> mapping variables to their associated agent.  <math>\\alpha(v_i) \\mapsto a_j</math> implies that it is agent <math>a_j</math>'s responsibility to assign the value of variable <math>v_i</math>.  Note that it is not necessarily true that <math>\\alpha</math> is either an [[Injective function|injection]] or [[surjection]]; and\n*<math>\\eta</math> is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] that aggregates all of the individual <math>f</math> costs for all possible variable assignments.  This is usually accomplished through summation:<center><math>\\eta(f) \\mapsto \\sum_{s \\in \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathfrak{P}(V)}\\sum{v_i \\in S} \\left( \\{v_i\\} \\times D_i \\right)} f(s)</math>.</center>\n\nThe objective of a DCOP is to have each agent assign values to its associated variables in order to either minimize or maximize <math>\\eta(f)</math> for a given assignment of the variables.\n\n===Context===\n\nA '''context''' is a variable assignment for a DCOP.  This can be thought of as a function mapping variables in the DCOP to their current values:<center><math>t : V \\rightarrow (D \\in \\mathfrak{D}) \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}.</math></center>  Note that a context is essentially a partial solution and need not contain values for ''every'' variable in the problem; therefore, <math>t(v_i) \\mapsto \\emptyset</math> implies that the agent <math>\\alpha(v_i)</math> has not yet assigned a value to variable <math>v_i</math>.  Given this representation, the \"[[Domain (mathematics)|domain]]\" (''i.e.'', the set of  input values) of the function <code>f</code> can be thought of as the set of all possible contexts for the DCOP.  Therefore, in the remainder of this article we may use the notion of a context (''i.e.'', the <math>t</math> function) as an input to the <math>f</math> function.\n\n==Example problems==\n\n===Distributed graph coloring===\nThe [[graph coloring]] problem is as follows: given a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] <math>G = \\langle N, E \\rangle</math> and a set of colors <math>C</math>, assign each [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]], <math>n\\subset N</math>, a color, <math>c\\leq C</math>, such that the number of adjacent vertices with the same color is minimized.\n\nAs a DCOP, there is one agent per vertex that is assigned to decide the associated color.  Each agent has a single variable whose associated domain is of [[cardinality]] <math>|C|</math> (there is one domain value for each possible color).  For each vertex <math>n_i \\leq N</math>, create a variable in the DCOP <math>v_i \\in V</math> with domain <math>D_i = C</math>.  For each pair of adjacent vertices <math>\\langle n_i, n_j \\rangle \\in E</math>, create a constraint of cost 1 if both of the associated variables are assigned the same color: <center><math>(\\forall c \\subseteq C : f(\\langle v_i, c \\rangle, \\langle v_j, c \\rangle ) \\mapsto 1).</math></center>The objective, then, is to minimize <math>\\eta(f)</math>.\n\n===Distributed multiple knapsack problem===\nThe ''distributed multiple-'' variant of the [[knapsack problem]] is as follows: given a set of items of varying volume and a set of knapsacks of varying capacity, assign each item to a knapsack such that the amount of overflow is minimized.  Let <math>I</math> be the set of items, <math>K</math> be the set of knapsacks, <math>s : I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}</math> be a function mapping items to their volume, and <math>c : K \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}</math> be a function mapping knapsacks to their capacities.\n\nTo encode this problem as a DCOP, for each <math>i \\in I</math> create one variable <math>v_i \\in V</math> with associated domain <math>D_i = K</math>.

The club's origins can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. An amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861. They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace exhibition building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] in 1895 at the sports stadium situated inside the Palace grounds and ten years later decided to form a new professional club to play at the venue. They stayed here until 1915, but were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and eventually moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924.\n\nPalace applied to gain election to the [[Football League]] in 1905, but missed out by one vote. They instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division and were champions in their first season. The club played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years. The Football League was restructured in 1920 which saw the majority of the Southern League First Division forming a new [[Football League Third Division]] which Palace became founder members of. At the end of the season Palace were crowned champions and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After four seasons they suffered relegation to what was then the [[Third Division South]] and remained here until the Football League was restructured which saw Palace become founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958. Over the next eleven years, under the chairmanship of [[Arthur Wait]], the club progressed up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], then the top flight of English football. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era played for the first time in London in a friendly match at Selhurst Park. In 1973, the manager at that time [[Bert Head]] was moved upstairs to take the position of general manager. [[Malcolm Allison]] was brought in as team manager, but Palace were relegated back to the Second Division, and then to the Third in consecutive seasons. Allison instigated a number of changes at the club, their original nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and they ended the 68-year association with claret and blue kit colours by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now worn today. \n\nAt the end of the [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] season, Allison left the club, and [[Terry Venables]] became manager taking Palace back to the top flight with promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period between 1989\u201391, under chairman [[Ron Noades]] and manager [[Steve Coppell]], saw the club reach the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], and finish in third place in the top division in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season, only missing out on European qualification due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace became founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club bounced between the top two divisions during the rest of the 1990s, and enjoyed runs to the semi-finals of both the [[Football League Cup|League]] and [[FA Cup|FA]] Cups in 1995, before suffering [[Administration (law)|administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Mark Goldberg]]. Under new owner [[Simon Jordan]] the club spent much of its time in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] over the next ten years with a brief spell in the Premier League during [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. Another administration in 2010 saw the club emerge owned by a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]]. Palace then achieved promotion back to the Premier League via the [[Football League play-offs]] in 2013, and have since maintained their place among the elite and also reached the [[2016 FA Cup Final]].\n\n==Origins and formation (1854\u20131905)==\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\nBetween 1852 and 1854, the glass exhibition building known as [[The Crystal Palace]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861 as an amateur outfit.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]] reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi-finals]] where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] in a replay after the first game ended goalless. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the Football Association adopted a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] which was to be played at the sports stadium situated inside the historic grounds of the Palace. With the owners also reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and founded the [[London County Cricket Club]] of [[W. G. Grace]] before turning their attention to football.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11\u201313</ref>\n\nThe idea of a new club playing at the Crystal Palace stadium was proposed in 1904 by the Crystal Palace Company. The proposal was rejected by the Football Association, who disliked the idea that the owners of the Cup Final venue would also possess their own football club. However a separate company was established the following year to form the club under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Bourne]], who was chosen due to his propensity in buying tickets to the Cup Final.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Southern League (1905\u201320)==\n{{see also|1905 in association football}}\n\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Crystal Palace squad of 1905\u201306.]]\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club was founded on 10 September 1905,<ref name=CPOS>{{cite web|last=Byfield |first=Terry |title=History |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |accessdate=27 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] colours of claret and blue.<ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781848365421|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> The choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].

Unfortunately, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and the club were forced to settle for a place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division.<ref name=ADDI /> To increase the number of club fixtures, Palace also joined the mid-week United Counties League.<ref name=ADDI /> Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of matches against other clubs' reserve sides, alongside [[Southall F.C.|Southall]], [[Southern United F.C.|Southern United]], [[Hastings & St Leonards United F.C.|St. Leonards United]] and [[Grays United F.C.|Grays United]],<ref name=ADDI /> was a successful one. Their opening match was against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to be seated. Palace led 3\u20130 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3\u20134. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9\u20131 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4\u20130 defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] Reserves in March.<ref>Matthews, p.14</ref>\n\nFollowing their championship win, Palace started their second season as a club in the Southern League First Division, placing nineteenth at the end of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating [[Rotherham County F.C.|Rotherham County]] in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through [[Horace Astley]] against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock [[Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1\u20130]] win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.<ref>Matthews, pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Smith goal for Crystal Palace circa 1914.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A headed goal scored by [[Edwin Smith (footballer)|Edwin Smith]] from a [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Billy Davies]] cross against [[Reading F.C.]], c.&nbsp;1914]]\nJohn Robson left Palace to manage neighbours [[Croydon Common F.C.]] for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Bill Davies]] became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup Palace lost 0\u20139 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a second round replay, which was a record defeat for the club. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the league the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the [[London Challenge Cup]] in 1913, overcoming [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2\u20131 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and provided their first [[England national football team|England]] representative in [[Horace Colclough]], who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.<ref>Matthews, pp.16\u201319</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Reservists]] before the season started. Former Palace players [[Ginger Williams (footballer)|Ginger Williams]] and [[Joe Bulcock]] were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, [[The Admiralty]], who had taken over the Palace and its grounds at the start of the war, ordered the club to leave and Palace chose to move to [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. When Croydon Common F.C. failed to return to business after the war, Palace moved to their ground known as [[The Nest (stadium)|The Nest]] which was opposite [[Selhurst railway station]]. In the first full season after the war, Palace finished in third place in 1919\u201320.<ref>Matthews, pp.19, 23\u201326</ref>\n\n==The Football League (1920\u201358)==\nCrystal Palace became a Football League club in 1920 when the Southern League First Division clubs were admitted ''en bloc'' as founder members of a newly formed Football League [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever Football League goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton. The feat earned them promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until 1978\u201379,<ref>Matthews, p.26, 28</ref> and they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace also won their third London Challenge Cup, beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] 1\u20130 at [[White Hart Lane]] with a goal from forward [[John Conner (footballer)|John Conner]].<ref>Matthews, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Alderson Caricature 1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], caricatured in the ''Football Special'' in 1922.

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]<nowiki/> were formed, but for now Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the match against Fulham. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table during the following season, 1922\u201323, eventually finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29\u201330</ref>\n\nBack in 1919, the Palace minute book contained an entry instructing the Secretary to investigate the possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst', although calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since at the time it was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]]. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of \u00a32,750, and renowned football ground architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to design [[Selhurst Park]]. Leitch had designed stands at [[Craven Cottage]], [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], White Hart Lane and [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], but the design for Selhurst Park was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on the 30 August 1924, the stand had not been completed. It did however boast many luxuries, including \"offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths\". The opening fixture was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0\u20131, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, with the club eventually finishing in twenty-first place \u2013 and were relegated along with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. A win in the last game at home to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0\u20131 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. It remains the only full international match to be staged at the ground.<ref>Matthews, pp.30, 33\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, their stay in the division was to last as long as the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346</ref>\n\nThe war years of 1939\u201345 saw football enter a period of disarray with the creation of [[Wartime League]]s. Palace joined the South \"A\" Division in 1939, but also joined the South League \"D\" in 1940, winning the latter competition, and then promptly winning an improvised South Regional League the following season on goal average. Palace joined the London League for the 1941\u201342 season, with the clubs in London refusing to accept the ad-hoc competitions the Football League were organising. This division only lasted that season before the London clubs were back in the Football League fold, with Palace joining the Football League South for the next four seasons.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;57\u201361</ref> The club fielded 186 different players during the seven wartime seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~754182,00.html |title=Palace During WWII |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=Crystal Palace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005340/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~754182%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKit changes had been introduced in the late 1930s. The 1937\u201338 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948\u201349, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and applying for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1950\u201351, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the bottom half of the table until the league was restructured in 1958\u201359, requiring re-election for a third and final time in 1955\u201356, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\"/>\n\n==Rising through the divisions (1958\u201373)==\nThe 1958\u201359 season began a period of change, with [[Arthur Wait]] taking control of the club as chairman and the league was restructured with Palace playing in the new Fourth Division. This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of Third Division South with those in the bottom half of Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Their first season in the Fourth Division saw Palace finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Surrey-born [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals, and his strike partner [[Roy Summersby]] netted 25 as Palace moved up to Division Three.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;79\u201380, 87\u201390</ref>\n\nPalace finished fifteenth in Division Three at the end of the 1961\u201362 season.

Johnny Byrne returned to the Palace line-up as a guest player. Madrid ended up 4\u20133 winners. Arthur Rowe resigned due to health reasons in December 1962 and the club appointed former player [[Dick Graham]] as manager.

Head promoted from the youth team and transferred in players both new and old, delighting the fans by re-signing old favourite Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968\u201369 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the beginning of the season, finished second behind [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] who were managed by [[Brian Clough]]. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.<ref>Matthews, pp.95\u201396, 103\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[The Dave Clark Five|The Dave Clark Five's]] chart-hit \"[[Glad All Over]]\" became a huge crowd favourite at this time with the Palace fans banging on advertising hoardings in time with the drum beat in the chorus of the song.<ref>Sedgwick, Fred. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family9 Family: Playlist: The Football Anthems of My Youth].\" The Guardian: 7. 26 May 2007.

After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.<ref>Matthews, 113\u2013115</ref> Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,<ref>Matthews, 115\u2013121</ref> and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"''Player of the Year''\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign. The first recipient was [[John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)|John McCormick]].<ref name=\"POTY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~559565,00.html |title=Player Of The Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907141243/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~559565%2C00.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |publisher=cpfc.co.uk (Crystal Palace F.C.) |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite some good performances in the 1972\u201373 season, notably a 5\u20130 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace eventually succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top flight. Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender [[Jim Cannon]]. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker [[Peter Osgood]] out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.<ref>Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140</ref>\n\n==The coming of The Eagles (1973\u201384)==\nDespite relegation, the 1973\u201374 season started with much optimism among the Palace supporters. Malcolm Allison had a strong recent record as a coach, having won trophies with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as an assistant to [[Joe Mercer]]. Allison or 'Big Mal' as he was nicknamed in the press, had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for the club, who previously had a rather conservative image. Palace's nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and the club also changed its colours from the original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]]. The Eagle was introduced as the club mascot at this time, an idea borrowed from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the club badge was redesigned. The new season saw the introduction of a three-up, three-down [[promotion and relegation]] system, and Palace struggled to find their feet in the Second Division, failing to win any of their first 15 league games. In bottom place for most of the season, the club, aided by the signing from [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] of pacey winger [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] climbed to seventeenth place with a 3\u20131 win at Fulham on [[Good Friday]]. The club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to win the last game of the season at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] to remain in the second tier of English football. They could only draw 1\u20131, and suffered relegation for a second successive season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\">Matthews, pp.141\u2013166</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace1970sbadge.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Malcolm Allison|Allison's]] rebranded Palace crest]]\n\nIn 1974\u201375, Palace's first season back in Division Three since 1963\u201364, saw the club miss out on promotion, finishing in fifth place. Allison acquired [[Terry Venables]] and [[Ian Evans (footballer)|Ian Evans]] from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in exchange for [[Don Rogers (footballer)|Don Rogers]], a trade that was to be significant to Palace's, and indeed England's football future. It was also around this time that Allison persuaded the club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team, a decision that would lead to both success at youth level, and the emergence of a number of promising young players in the first team. Palace again failed to gain promotion the following season, distracted in part by their best run in the FA Cup up to that point. The club reached the semi-finals, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and Chelsea along the way, before losing 0\u20132 to Southampton at Stamford Bridge on 3 April 1976. Allison resigned at the end of the season, partly because of the failure to get Palace promoted, but also he had felt pressure due to some of his off the field antics, infamously getting himself photographed in the team bath with porn star [[Fiona Richmond]].<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\"/><ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8067232/Malcolm-Allison.html Malcolm Allison].\" The Daily Telegraph: 31. 16 October 2010.

The Palace youngsters also won the [[FA Youth Cup]] with a side including [[Kenny Sansom]], [[Vince Hilaire]] and [[Billy Gilbert (footballer born 1959)|Billy Gilbert]]. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the title to fierce rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]]; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed [[Ian Walsh (footballer)|Ian Walsh]] to head the opener, before a great run by [[David Swindlehurst]] was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.\n\nAs an increasing number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the \"''Team of the Eighties''\". They began the 1979\u201380 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight and also went top of the table for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 4\u20131 at Selhurst Park in late September. Unfortunately the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a slide down the table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever league finish.<ref>Matthews, pp.223\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe slide continued into the 1980\u201381 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Palace to join QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated by the start of February when another, even bigger change occurred. [[Ron Noades]], previously the chairman of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. Palace spent the next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from the second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including the unpopular appointment of ex-Brighton manager [[Alan Mullery]].\n\n==Steve Coppell era  (1984\u201393)==\n[[File:Steve coppell 2006 promotion celebration cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Steve Coppell, who led Palace to the FA Cup Final and a third place finish in the top flight. Coppell has managed the club over four separate spells.]]\nThe former Manchester United and England winger [[Steve Coppell]] was appointed as Palace's new manager for the 1984\u201385 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, signing the then unknown [[Ian Wright]] from non-league [[Greenwich Borough F.C.|Greenwich Borough]] and [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the pair formed the \"''Wrighty & Brighty''\" strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1989 Second Division play-offs]], beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the first leg at [[Ewood Park]] the [[Lancashire]] club won 3\u20131, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3\u20130 after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player of the year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=1988/89 revisited|date=26 July 2009|url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|work=holmesdale.net|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f2D9LR?url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Matthews, p.289-292, 311\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;289\u2013292, 311</ref><ref>Matthews, pp.226\u2013236, 267\u2013285</ref>\n\nPalace began their first top flight campaign in almost a decade by re-signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1964)|Andy Gray]] from QPR for \u00a3500,000. In November, the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]] for \u00a31 million \u2013 a record fee for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most of the first half in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams ([[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool team that had beaten them 9\u20130 in the league earlier in the season. The tie was played at [[Villa Park]], and saw Liverpool score first to lead 1\u20130 at half-time. Palace emerged from the interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart equalised through Mark Bright. After going 2\u20131 up, Palace then found themselves 2\u20133 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. However an equaliser by Andy Gray with just two minutes remaining took the tie into extra-time, with the winner scored by [[Alan Pardew]] in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory and for the first time in their history, Palace were in the [[1990 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]].<ref>Matthews, pp.289\u2013292, 311</ref>\n\nTheir first ever appearance at Wembley Stadium saw Palace facing [[Alex Ferguson|Alex Ferguson's]] Manchester United. [[Gary O'Reilly]] opened the scoring for Palace, but [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Mark Hughes]] put United 2\u20131 up. Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch as a substitute to take the final into extra-time, before scoring again early in the added period to put Palace back in the lead. Hughes scored his second late on for United to leave the game drawn 3\u20133 and requiring a replay. In the replay Palace chose to wear a new one-off change strip of yellow and black striped shirts<ref>{{cite web|title=English FA Cup Finalists 1990\u20131999 |url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |work=Historical Football Kits |first=Dave |last=Moor |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f4wd3o?url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Palace In Colour Crisis|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Uq5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cZADAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=6631%2C381211|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=17 May 1990|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> The replay saw United left-back [[Lee Martin (footballer born February 1968)|Lee Martin]] cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Nigel Martyn to win the Cup for the Red Devils.<ref>Matthews, p.311</ref>\n\nThe club built on the success of the previous season and even challenged for the [[List of English football champions|English league title]] for most of the next season, but fell just short of eventual champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and runners-up Liverpool, finishing a club-best third in the top flight. Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985 had now been lifted, there would only be one place available in the [[UEFA Cup 1991-92|1991\u201392]] edition of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4\u20131 in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]] of the [[Full Members Cup]].\n\nThe following season was to become one marked by controversy. In September, [[Channel 4]] showed a documentary called ''Critical Eye \u2013 Great Britain United'', which featured interviews with a number of club personnel. Among them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented \"when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through\". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programme makers,<ref>Duncan, John. \"Noades Still Under Fire.\" The Guardian: 16. 17 September 1991. ProQuest. Web. 30 May 2013.</ref> and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million and Palace finished tenth in the First Division at the end of the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392 season]]. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new [[FA Premier League]] for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Mark Bright was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in September and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were relegated on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4\u20133 victory over Southampton on the last day of the season. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. The club's relegation prompted the resignation of Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]].<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;314\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Ups and downs (1993\u201398)==\n<!-- [[File:Eric Cantona kung-fu kick.jpg|thumb|Ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player [[Eric Cantona]] kicks spectator Matthew Simmons]] -->\n\nAlan Smith immediately guided Palace back to the Premier League as runaway champions of the second tier,<ref>Alexander, Jeremy. \"Soccer: FIRST DIVISION: Palace Promoted a Day Late Luton Town 0, Crystal Palace 1.\" The Guardian (pre-1997 Fulltext): 0. 18 April 1994.

The club's origins can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. An amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861. They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace exhibition building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] in 1895 at the sports stadium situated inside the Palace grounds and ten years later decided to form a new professional club to play at the venue. They stayed here until 1915, but were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and eventually moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924.\n\nPalace applied to gain election to the [[Football League]] in 1905, but missed out by one vote. They instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division and were champions in their first season. The club played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years. The Football League was restructured in 1920 which saw the majority of the Southern League First Division forming a new [[Football League Third Division]] which Palace became founder members of. At the end of the season Palace were crowned champions and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After four seasons they suffered relegation to what was then the [[Third Division South]] and remained here until the Football League was restructured which saw Palace become founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958. Over the next eleven years, under the chairmanship of [[Arthur Wait]], the club progressed up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], then the top flight of English football. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era played for the first time in London in a friendly match at Selhurst Park. In 1973, the manager at that time [[Bert Head]] was moved upstairs to take the position of general manager. [[Malcolm Allison]] was brought in as team manager, but Palace were relegated back to the Second Division, and then to the Third in consecutive seasons. Allison instigated a number of changes at the club, their original nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and they ended the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. \n\nAt the end of the [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] season, Allison left the club, and [[Terry Venables]] became manager taking Palace back to the top flight with promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period between 1989\u201391, under chairman [[Ron Noades]] and manager [[Steve Coppell]], saw the club reach the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], and finish in third place in the top division in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season, only missing out on European qualification due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace became founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club bounced between the top two divisions during the rest of the 1990s, and enjoyed runs to the semi-finals of both the [[Football League Cup|League]] and [[FA Cup|FA]] Cups in 1995, before suffering [[Administration (law)|administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Mark Goldberg]]. Under new owner [[Simon Jordan]] the club spent much of its time in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] over the next ten years with a brief spell in the Premier League during [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. Another administration in 2010 saw the club emerge owned by a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]]. Palace then achieved promotion back to the Premier League via the [[Football League play-offs]] in 2013, and have since maintained their place among the elite and also reached the [[2016 FA Cup Final]].\n\n==Origins and formation (1854\u20131905)==\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\nBetween 1852 and 1854, the glass exhibition building known as [[The Crystal Palace]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 including the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] surrounding the site where various sports facilities were built. The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861 as an amateur outfit.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I.

The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the Football Association adopted a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] which was to be played at the sports stadium situated inside the historic grounds of the Palace. With the owners also reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and founded the [[London County Cricket Club]] of [[W. G. Grace]] before turning their attention to football.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11\u201313</ref>\n\nThe idea of a new club playing at the Crystal Palace stadium was proposed in 1904 by the Crystal Palace Company. The proposal was rejected by the Football Association, who disliked the idea that the owners of the Cup Final venue would also possess their own football club. However a separate company was established the following year to form the club under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Bourne]], who was chosen due to his propensity in buying tickets to the Cup Final.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Southern League (1905\u201320)==\n{{see also|1905 in association football}}\n\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Crystal Palace squad of 1905\u201306.]]\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club was founded on 10 September 1905,<ref name=CPOS>{{cite web|last=Byfield |first=Terry |title=History |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |accessdate=27 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] colours of claret and blue.<ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781848365421|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> The choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].

Unfortunately, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and the club were forced to settle for a place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division.<ref name=ADDI /> To increase the number of club fixtures, Palace also joined the mid-week United Counties League.<ref name=ADDI /> Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of matches against other clubs' reserve sides, alongside [[Southall F.C.|Southall]], [[Southern United F.C.|Southern United]], [[Hastings & St Leonards United F.C.|St. Leonards United]] and [[Grays United F.C.|Grays United]],<ref name=ADDI /> was a successful one. Their opening match was against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to be seated. Palace led 3\u20130 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3\u20134. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9\u20131 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4\u20130 defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] Reserves in March.<ref>Matthews, p.14</ref>\n\nFollowing their championship win, Palace started their second season as a club in the Southern League First Division, placing nineteenth at the end of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating [[Rotherham County F.C.|Rotherham County]] in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through [[Horace Astley]] against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock [[Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1\u20130]] win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.<ref>Matthews, pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Smith goal for Crystal Palace circa 1914.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A headed goal scored by [[Edwin Smith (footballer)|Edwin Smith]] from a [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Billy Davies]] cross against [[Reading F.C.]], c.&nbsp;1914]]\nJohn Robson left Palace to manage neighbours [[Croydon Common F.C.]] for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Bill Davies]] became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup Palace lost 0\u20139 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a second round replay, which was a record defeat for the club. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the league the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the [[London Challenge Cup]] in 1913, overcoming [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2\u20131 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and provided their first [[England national football team|England]] representative in [[Horace Colclough]], who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.<ref>Matthews, pp.16\u201319</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Reservists]] before the season started. Former Palace players [[Ginger Williams (footballer)|Ginger Williams]] and [[Joe Bulcock]] were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, [[The Admiralty]], who had taken over the Palace and its grounds at the start of the war, ordered the club to leave and Palace chose to move to [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. When Croydon Common F.C. failed to return to business after the war, Palace moved to their ground known as [[The Nest (stadium)|The Nest]] which was opposite [[Selhurst railway station]]. In the first full season after the war, Palace finished in third place in 1919\u201320.<ref>Matthews, pp.19, 23\u201326</ref>\n\n==The Football League (1920\u201358)==\nCrystal Palace became a Football League club in 1920 when the Southern League First Division clubs were admitted ''en bloc'' as founder members of a newly formed Football League [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever Football League goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton. The feat earned them promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until 1978\u201379,<ref>Matthews, p.26, 28</ref> and they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace also won their third London Challenge Cup, beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] 1\u20130 at [[White Hart Lane]] with a goal from forward [[John Conner (footballer)|John Conner]].<ref>Matthews, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Alderson Caricature 1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], caricatured in the ''Football Special'' in 1922.

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]<nowiki/> were formed, but for now Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the match against Fulham. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table during the following season, 1922\u201323, eventually finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29\u201330</ref>\n\nBack in 1919, the Palace minute book contained an entry instructing the Secretary to investigate the possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst', although calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since at the time it was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]]. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of \u00a32,750, and renowned football ground architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to design [[Selhurst Park]]. Leitch had designed stands at [[Craven Cottage]], [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], White Hart Lane and [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], but the design for Selhurst Park was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on the 30 August 1924, the stand had not been completed. It did however boast many luxuries, including \"offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths\". The opening fixture was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0\u20131, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, with the club eventually finishing in twenty-first place \u2013 and were relegated along with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. A win in the last game at home to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0\u20131 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. It remains the only full international match to be staged at the ground.<ref>Matthews, pp.30, 33\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, their stay in the division was to last as long as the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346</ref>\n\nThe war years of 1939\u201345 saw football enter a period of disarray with the creation of [[Wartime League]]s. Palace joined the South \"A\" Division in 1939, but also joined the South League \"D\" in 1940, winning the latter competition, and then promptly winning an improvised South Regional League the following season on goal average. Palace joined the London League for the 1941\u201342 season, with the clubs in London refusing to accept the ad-hoc competitions the Football League were organising. This division only lasted that season before the London clubs were back in the Football League fold, with Palace joining the Football League South for the next four seasons.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;57\u201361</ref> The club fielded 186 different players during the seven wartime seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~754182,00.html |title=Palace During WWII |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=Crystal Palace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005340/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~754182%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKit changes had been introduced in the late 1930s. The 1937\u201338 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948\u201349, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and applying for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1950\u201351, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the bottom half of the table until the league was restructured in 1958\u201359, requiring re-election for a third and final time in 1955\u201356, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\"/>\n\n==Rising through the divisions (1958\u201373)==\nThe 1958\u201359 season began a period of change, with [[Arthur Wait]] taking control of the club as chairman and the league was restructured with Palace playing in the new Fourth Division. This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of Third Division South with those in the bottom half of Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Their first season in the Fourth Division saw Palace finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Surrey-born [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals, and his strike partner [[Roy Summersby]] netted 25 as Palace moved up to Division Three.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;79\u201380, 87\u201390</ref>\n\nPalace finished fifteenth in Division Three at the end of the 1961\u201362 season.

This was a record fee between two British clubs at the time. Byrne left having scored ninety-six goals for Palace, then a post-war record.<ref>Matthews, pp.90\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.

Johnny Byrne returned to the Palace line-up as a guest player. Madrid ended up 4\u20133 winners. Arthur Rowe resigned due to health reasons in December 1962 and the club appointed former player [[Dick Graham]] as manager. The 1962\u201363 season saw Palace finish eleventh, before gaining promotion to the Second Division the following season after finishing second behind Coventry City on goal average.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;93\u201395</ref> \n\nFor the following four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes in the Second Division, during which they appointed [[Bert Head]] as their new manager in April 1966. Head promoted from the youth team and transferred in players both new and old, delighting the fans by re-signing old favourite Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968\u201369 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the beginning of the season, finished second behind [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] who were managed by [[Brian Clough]]. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.<ref>Matthews, pp.95\u201396, 103\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[The Dave Clark Five|The Dave Clark Five's]] chart-hit \"[[Glad All Over]]\" became a huge crowd favourite at this time with the Palace fans banging on advertising hoardings in time with the drum beat in the chorus of the song.<ref>Sedgwick, Fred. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family9 Family: Playlist: The Football Anthems of My Youth].\" The Guardian: 7. 26 May 2007.

Scoring the first Division One goal for the club was [[Mel Blyth]] after six minutes, and a second goal from new signing [[Gerry Queen]] saw Palace hold United to a 2\u20132 draw with goalkeeper [[John Jackson (footballer born 1942)|John Jackson]] denying [[George Best]] and [[Brian Kidd]]. The next match was another home game versus [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] which Palace won 2\u20130. After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.<ref>Matthews, 113\u2013115</ref> Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,<ref>Matthews, 115\u2013121</ref> and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"''Player of the Year''\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign. The first recipient was [[John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)|John McCormick]].<ref name=\"POTY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~559565,00.html |title=Player Of The Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907141243/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~559565%2C00.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |publisher=cpfc.co.uk (Crystal Palace F.C.) |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite some good performances in the 1972\u201373 season, notably a 5\u20130 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace eventually succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top flight. Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender [[Jim Cannon]]. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker [[Peter Osgood]] out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.<ref>Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140</ref>\n\n==The coming of The Eagles (1973\u201384)==\nDespite relegation, the 1973\u201374 season started with much optimism among the Palace supporters. Malcolm Allison had a strong recent record as a coach, having won trophies with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as an assistant to [[Joe Mercer]]. Allison or 'Big Mal' as he was nicknamed in the press, had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for the club, who previously had a rather conservative image. Palace's nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and the club also changed its colours from the original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]]. The Eagle was introduced as the club mascot at this time, an idea borrowed from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the club badge was redesigned. The new season saw the introduction of a three-up, three-down [[promotion and relegation]] system, and Palace struggled to find their feet in the Second Division, failing to win any of their first 15 league games. In bottom place for most of the season, the club, aided by the signing from [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] of pacey winger [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] climbed to seventeenth place with a 3\u20131 win at Fulham on [[Good Friday]]. The club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to win the last game of the season at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] to remain in the second tier of English football. They could only draw 1\u20131, and suffered relegation for a second successive season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\">Matthews, pp.141\u2013166</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace1970sbadge.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Malcolm Allison|Allison's]] rebranded Palace crest]]\n\nIn 1974\u201375, Palace's first season back in Division Three since 1963\u201364, saw the club miss out on promotion, finishing in fifth place. Allison acquired [[Terry Venables]] and [[Ian Evans (footballer)|Ian Evans]] from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in exchange for [[Don Rogers (footballer)|Don Rogers]], a trade that was to be significant to Palace's, and indeed England's football future. It was also around this time that Allison persuaded the club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team, a decision that would lead to both success at youth level, and the emergence of a number of promising young players in the first team. Palace again failed to gain promotion the following season, distracted in part by their best run in the FA Cup up to that point. The club reached the semi-finals, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and Chelsea along the way, before losing 0\u20132 to Southampton at Stamford Bridge on 3 April 1976. Allison resigned at the end of the season, partly because of the failure to get Palace promoted, but also he had felt pressure due to some of his off the field antics, infamously getting himself photographed in the team bath with porn star [[Fiona Richmond]].<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\"/><ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8067232/Malcolm-Allison.html Malcolm Allison].\" The Daily Telegraph: 31. 16 October 2010.

The Palace youngsters also won the [[FA Youth Cup]] with a side including [[Kenny Sansom]], [[Vince Hilaire]] and [[Billy Gilbert (footballer born 1959)|Billy Gilbert]]. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the title to fierce rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]]; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed [[Ian Walsh (footballer)|Ian Walsh]] to head the opener, before a great run by [[David Swindlehurst]] was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.\n\nAs an increasing number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the \"''Team of the Eighties''\". They began the 1979\u201380 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight and also went top of the table for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 4\u20131 at Selhurst Park in late September. Unfortunately the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a slide down the table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever league finish.<ref>Matthews, pp.223\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe slide continued into the 1980\u201381 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Palace to join QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated by the start of February when another, even bigger change occurred. [[Ron Noades]], previously the chairman of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. Palace spent the next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from the second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including the unpopular appointment of ex-Brighton manager [[Alan Mullery]].\n\n==Steve Coppell era  (1984\u201393)==\n[[File:Steve coppell 2006 promotion celebration cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Steve Coppell, who led Palace to the FA Cup Final and a third place finish in the top flight. Coppell has managed the club over four separate spells.]]\nThe former Manchester United and England winger [[Steve Coppell]] was appointed as Palace's new manager for the 1984\u201385 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, signing the then unknown [[Ian Wright]] from non-league [[Greenwich Borough F.C.|Greenwich Borough]] and [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the pair formed the \"''Wrighty & Brighty''\" strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1989 Second Division play-offs]], beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the first leg at [[Ewood Park]] the [[Lancashire]] club won 3\u20131, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3\u20130 after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player of the year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=1988/89 revisited|date=26 July 2009|url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|work=holmesdale.net|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f2D9LR?url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Matthews, p.289-292, 311\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;289\u2013292, 311</ref><ref>Matthews, pp.226\u2013236, 267\u2013285</ref>\n\nPalace began their first top flight campaign in almost a decade by re-signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1964)|Andy Gray]] from QPR for \u00a3500,000. In November, the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]] for \u00a31 million \u2013 a record fee for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most of the first half in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams ([[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool team that had beaten them 9\u20130 in the league earlier in the season. The tie was played at [[Villa Park]], and saw Liverpool score first to lead 1\u20130 at half-time. Palace emerged from the interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart equalised through Mark Bright. After going 2\u20131 up, Palace then found themselves 2\u20133 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. However an equaliser by Andy Gray with just two minutes remaining took the tie into extra-time, with the winner scored by [[Alan Pardew]] in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory and for the first time in their history, Palace were in the [[1990 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]].<ref>Matthews, pp.289\u2013292, 311</ref>\n\nTheir first ever appearance at Wembley Stadium saw Palace facing [[Alex Ferguson|Alex Ferguson's]] Manchester United. [[Gary O'Reilly]] opened the scoring for Palace, but [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Mark Hughes]] put United 2\u20131 up. Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch as a substitute to take the final into extra-time, before scoring again early in the added period to put Palace back in the lead. Hughes scored his second late on for United to leave the game drawn 3\u20133 and requiring a replay. In the replay Palace chose to wear a new one-off change strip of yellow and black striped shirts<ref>{{cite web|title=English FA Cup Finalists 1990\u20131999 |url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |work=Historical Football Kits |first=Dave |last=Moor |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f4wd3o?url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/1990-1999.html |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Palace In Colour Crisis|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Uq5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cZADAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=6631%2C381211|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=17 May 1990|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> The replay saw United left-back [[Lee Martin (footballer born February 1968)|Lee Martin]] cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Nigel Martyn to win the Cup for the Red Devils.<ref>Matthews, p.311</ref>\n\nThe club built on the success of the previous season and even challenged for the [[List of English football champions|English league title]] for most of the next season, but fell just short of eventual champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and runners-up Liverpool, finishing a club-best third in the top flight. Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985 had now been lifted, there would only be one place available in the [[UEFA Cup 1991-92|1991\u201392]] edition of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4\u20131 in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]] of the [[Full Members Cup]].\n\nThe following season was to become one marked by controversy. In September, [[Channel 4]] showed a documentary called ''Critical Eye \u2013 Great Britain United'', which featured interviews with a number of club personnel. Among them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented \"when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through\". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programme makers,<ref>Duncan, John. \"Noades Still Under Fire.\" The Guardian: 16. 17 September 1991. ProQuest. Web. 30 May 2013.</ref> and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million and Palace finished tenth in the First Division at the end of the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392 season]]. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new [[FA Premier League]] for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Mark Bright was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in September and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were relegated on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4\u20133 victory over Southampton on the last day of the season. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. The club's relegation prompted the resignation of Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]].<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;314\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Ups and downs (1993\u201398)==\n<!-- [[File:Eric Cantona kung-fu kick.jpg|thumb|Ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player [[Eric Cantona]] kicks spectator Matthew Simmons]] -->\n\nAlan Smith immediately guided Palace back to the Premier League as runaway champions of the second tier,<ref>Alexander, Jeremy. \"Soccer: FIRST DIVISION: Palace Promoted a Day Late Luton Town 0, Crystal Palace 1.\" The Guardian (pre-1997 Fulltext): 0. 18 April 1994.
