Twelve teams continued to contest Division A as in recent seasons, consisting of the top eleven finishers from last year plus [[Azerbaijan national beach soccer team|Azerbaijan]] who were promoted to the top tier. Division B was expanded to accommodate fifteen nations; the thirteen nations which did not gain promotion from last season, [[Lithuania national beach soccer team|Lithuania]] who made their debut, plus [[Romania national beach soccer team|Romania]] who were relegated from the top tier. No nations returned to the tournament after an absence from competing in recent years.\n\nThis season, in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the competition, additional matches were scheduled for a total of five ''stages'' of fixtures during the [[regular season]]. Each team from Division A played in two stages whilst each team from Division B played in one stage. During each stage the participating nations earned points for the overall league tables.\n\nAt the end of the regular season stages, according to the league tables, the eight best teams in Division A advanced to the [[post-season]] Superfinal to compete directly to become the winners of this year's EBSL. Meanwhile, the top seven teams in Division B (the stage winners and best runners-up) and the team ranked bottom of Division A played in the Promotion Final to try to earn a spot in Division A next year.\n\n[[Turkey national beach soccer team|Turkey]] were promoted to Division A after beating [[Estonia national beach soccer team|Estonia]] to claim the Promotion Final title. This sees Turkey return to the top flight for the first time since they were relegated from Division A in [[2011 Euro Beach Soccer League|2011]]. [[Greece national beach soccer team|Greece]] finished last in Division A and failed to defend their place in the Promotion Final and were therefore subsequently relegated to Division B, ending their four-year run in the top tier.\n\n[[Russia national beach soccer team|Russia]] won the league after a strong performance in the Superfinal, claiming their fifth EBSL crown to tie for first with [[Spain national beach soccer team|Spain]] and [[Portugal national beach soccer team|Portugal]] with the most titles in EBSL history. Defending champions [[Ukraine national beach soccer team|Ukraine]] were knocked out of title-winning contention in the group stage of the Superfinal, ultimately finishing seventh in the post-season event.\n\n== Calendar and locations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"200\"| Dates\n!width=\"120\"| Country\n!width=\"120\"| City\n!width=\"250\"| Stage\n|-\n| 23\u201325 June || {{flag|Serbia}} || [[Belgrade]] || Stage 1\n|-\n| 7\u20139 July || {{flag|Portugal}} || [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]] || Stage 2\n|-\n| 28\u201330 July || {{flag|Russia}} || [[Moscow]] || Stage 3\n|-\n| 11\u201313 August || {{flag|Hungary}} || [[Si\u00f3fok]] || Stage 4\n|-\n| 25\u201327 August || {{flag|Germany}} || [[Warnem\u00fcnde]] || Stage 5\n|-\n| 14\u201317 September|| {{flag|Italy}} || [[Terracina]] || Superfinal and Promotion Final\n|}\n\n==Teams==\n[[File:2017 EBSL map of nations.png|thumb|400px|{{legend|#67E863|Competing in '''Division A'''}} {{legend|#6085EF|Competing in '''Division B'''}} {{legend|#F36971|Competed in previous editions but not this year}} {{legend|#C3C3C3|Never competed in the EBSL}}]]\nThe following teams have entered this season, in the following divisions (12 in Division A, 15 in Division B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroonba.com/beachsoccer/men/fixtures.html|title=MEN'S BEACH SOCCER - FIXTURES|publisher=theroonba.com|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe numbers in brackets show the European ranking of each team prior to the start of the season, out of 36 nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/ranking/overall |title=OVERALL WORLD RANKING |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=8 June 2017 |accessdate=8 June 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608011017/http://beachsoccer.com/ranking/overall |archivedate=8 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Division A===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{beachsoccer|POR}} <small>(1st)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|RUS}} <small>(2nd)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ITA}} <small>(3rd)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|SUI}} <small>(4th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|POL}} <small>(5th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ESP}} <small>(6th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|UKR}} <small>(7th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|BLR}} <small>(9th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|FRA}} <small>(11th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|GER}} <small>(12th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|AZE}}<sup>'''[[#1|1]]'''</sup> <small>(14th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|GRE}} <small>(15th)</small>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Division B===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{beachsoccer|HUN}} <small>(8th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ENG}} <small>(10th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|CZE}} <small>(13th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|TUR}} <small>(16th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ROM}}<sup>'''[[#2|2]]'''</sup> <small>(17th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|EST}} <small>(18th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|MDA}} <small>(19th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|NED}} <small>(20th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|NOR}} <small>(21st)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|SRB}} <small>(22nd)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|BUL}} <small>(24th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|KAZ}} <small>(25th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|DEN}} <small>(26th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|AND}} <small>(27th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|LTU}}<sup>'''[[#3|3]]'''</sup> <small>(28th)</small>\n{{div col end}}\n{{smalldiv|\n'''Notes:'''\n:<div id=\"1\">1.

soccer]] contested between men's national teams, in a league and play-off format.\n\nThis season teams continued to take part in two divisions, the top tier (Division A) and the bottom tier (Division B). Twelve teams continued to contest Division A as in recent seasons, consisting of the top eleven finishers from last year plus [[Azerbaijan national beach soccer team|Azerbaijan]] who were promoted to the top tier. Division B was expanded to accommodate fifteen nations; the thirteen nations which did not gain promotion from last season, [[Lithuania national beach soccer team|Lithuania]] who made their debut, plus [[Romania national beach soccer team|Romania]] who were relegated from the top tier. No nations returned to the tournament after an absence from competing in recent years.\n\nThis season, in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the competition, additional matches were scheduled for a total of five ''stages'' of fixtures during the [[regular season]]. Each team from Division A played in two stages whilst each team from Division B played in one stage. During each stage the participating nations earned points for the overall league tables.\n\nAt the end of the regular season stages, according to the league tables, the eight best teams in Division A advanced to the [[post-season]] Superfinal to compete directly to become the winners of this year's EBSL. Meanwhile, the top seven teams in Division B (the stage winners and best runners-up) and the team ranked bottom of Division A played in the Promotion Final to try to earn a spot in Division A next year.\n\n[[Turkey national beach soccer team|Turkey]] were promoted to Division A after beating [[Estonia national beach soccer team|Estonia]] to claim the Promotion Final title. This sees Turkey return to the top flight for the first time since they were relegated from Division A in [[2011 Euro Beach Soccer League|2011]]. [[Greece national beach soccer team|Greece]] finished last in Division A and failed to defend their place in the Promotion Final and were therefore subsequently relegated to Division B, ending their four-year run in the top tier.\n\n[[Russia national beach soccer team|Russia]] won the league after a strong performance in the Superfinal, claiming their fifth EBSL crown to tie for first with [[Spain national beach soccer team|Spain]] and [[Portugal national beach soccer team|Portugal]] with the most titles in EBSL history. Defending champions [[Ukraine national beach soccer team|Ukraine]] were knocked out of title-winning contention in the group stage of the Superfinal, ultimately finishing seventh in the post-season event.\n\n== Calendar and locations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"200\"| Dates\n!width=\"120\"| Country\n!width=\"120\"| City\n!width=\"250\"| Stage\n|-\n| 23\u201325 June || {{flag|Serbia}} || [[Belgrade]] || Stage 1\n|-\n| 7\u20139 July || {{flag|Portugal}} || [[Nazar\u00e9, Portugal|Nazar\u00e9]] || Stage 2\n|-\n| 28\u201330 July || {{flag|Russia}} || [[Moscow]] || Stage 3\n|-\n| 11\u201313 August || {{flag|Hungary}} || [[Si\u00f3fok]] || Stage 4\n|-\n| 25\u201327 August || {{flag|Germany}} || [[Warnem\u00fcnde]] || Stage 5\n|-\n| 14\u201317 September|| {{flag|Italy}} || [[Terracina]] || Superfinal and Promotion Final\n|}\n\n==Teams==\n[[File:2017 EBSL map of nations.png|thumb|400px|{{legend|#67E863|Competing in '''Division A'''}} {{legend|#6085EF|Competing in '''Division B'''}} {{legend|#F36971|Competed in previous editions but not this year}} {{legend|#C3C3C3|Never competed in the EBSL}}]]\nThe following teams have entered this season, in the following divisions (12 in Division A, 15 in Division B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroonba.com/beachsoccer/men/fixtures.html|title=MEN'S BEACH SOCCER - FIXTURES|publisher=theroonba.com|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe numbers in brackets show the European ranking of each team prior to the start of the season, out of 36 nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beachsoccer.com/ranking/overall |title=OVERALL WORLD RANKING |publisher=beachsoccer.com |date=8 June 2017 |accessdate=8 June 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608011017/http://beachsoccer.com/ranking/overall |archivedate=8 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Division A===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{beachsoccer|POR}} <small>(1st)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|RUS}} <small>(2nd)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ITA}} <small>(3rd)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|SUI}} <small>(4th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|POL}} <small>(5th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ESP}} <small>(6th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|UKR}} <small>(7th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|BLR}} <small>(9th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|FRA}} <small>(11th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|GER}} <small>(12th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|AZE}}<sup>'''[[#1|1]]'''</sup> <small>(14th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|GRE}} <small>(15th)</small>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Division B===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{beachsoccer|HUN}} <small>(8th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ENG}} <small>(10th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|CZE}} <small>(13th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|TUR}} <small>(16th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|ROM}}<sup>'''[[#2|2]]'''</sup> <small>(17th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|EST}} <small>(18th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|MDA}} <small>(19th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|NED}} <small>(20th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|NOR}} <small>(21st)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|SRB}} <small>(22nd)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|BUL}} <small>(24th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|KAZ}} <small>(25th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|DEN}} <small>(26th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|AND}} <small>(27th)</small>\n* {{beachsoccer|LTU}}<sup>'''[[#3|3]]'''</sup> <small>(28th)</small>\n{{div col end}}\n<small>'''Notes:'''\n:<div id=\"1\">1.

The total no. of assists recorded is 270 but 727 goals were scored. The discrepancy of the source not recording an assist for every goal scored may be due to a system in use such as [[Assist (football)#FIFA|FIFAs assists system]] - (regardless of who made the final pass to the scorer, no assist is awarded when the scorer ultimately lays the goal on for him/herself via a dribble, solo run etc, scores after intercepting an opponent's pass etc.). However since the system in use is not explained, note that assists may simply of gone undocumented.</small>\n\n===Discipline===\nThe following table lists the players and teams who received the most penalties for disciplinary infringements in each division in both the regular and post season events.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 93%;\"\n|-\n|-\n!Category\n!width=30|Div.\n!rowspan=9|\n!width=200 colspan=2|Player(s)\n!width=30|#\n!rowspan=9|\n!width=150|Team(s)\n!width=30|#\n|-\n|rowspan=2|'''Most yellow cards {{Tooltip|{{yel}}|Yellow card}}\n|A\n|colspan=2|{{flagicon|SUI}} Dejan Stankovi\u0107<br>{{flagicon|POL}} Konrad Kubiak<br>{{flagicon|ITA}} Gabriele Gori\n|'''4'''\n|{{beachsoccer|SUI}}\n|'''18'''\n|-\n|B\n|{{flagicon|SRB}} [[Nikola Valenti\u0107]]<br>{{flagicon|SRB}} Vojislav Trajkovic<br>{{flagicon|EST}} Ragnar Rump<br>{{flagicon|BUL}} Pavel Adamov<br>{{flagicon|BUL}} Martin Velikov<br>{{flagicon|BUL}} Stanislav Dzhambazov<br>{{flagicon|HUN}} Richard Patocs\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Filip Filipov<br>{{flagicon|ROM}} Bogdan Ciocanel<br>{{flagicon|MDA}} Victor Iordachi<br>{{flagicon|TUR}} Sem\u00edh T\u00fcrkmen<br>{{flagicon|ROM}} Gabriel Dobre<br>{{flagicon|BUL}} Kaloyan Tsvetkov<br>{{flagicon|LTU}} Viktor Bartosevic\n|'''2'''\n|{{beachsoccer|BUL}}\n|'''13'''\n|-\n!height=2 colspan=9|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|'''Second yellow cards''' {{Tooltip|{{sent off|2}}|Second yellow card}}\n|A\n|colspan=2|{{flagicon|POR}} [[:pt:Bruno Torres (futebolista)|Bruno Torres]]<br>{{flagicon|RUS}} Anton Shkarin\n|'''1'''\n|{{beachsoccer|POR}}<br>{{beachsoccer|RUS}}\n|'''1'''\n|-\n|B\n|colspan=2|{{flagicon|DEN}} Dan Storm\n|'''1'''\n|{{beachsoccer|DEN}}\n|'''1'''\n|-\n!height=2 colspan=9|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|'''Straight red cards''' {{Tooltip|{{sent off}}|Red card}}\n|A\n|colspan=2|{{flagicon|SUI}} Tobias Steinemann\n|'''1'''\n|{{beachsoccer|SUI}}\n|'''1'''\n|-\n|B\n|colspan=2|{{flagicon|TUR}} Erkan Anzafioglu<br>{{flagicon|LTU}} [[:lt:Aivaras Me\u0161kinis|Aivaras Me\u0161kinis]]<br>{{flagicon|ENG}} Taylor Humm<br>{{flagicon|MDA}} Leonid Podlesnov\n|'''1'''\n|{{beachsoccer|TUR}}<br>{{beachsoccer|LTU}}<br>{{beachsoccer|ENG}}<br>{{beachsoccer|MDA}}\n|colspan=2|'''1'''\n|}\n<small>\n[http://beachsoccerrussia.ru/tournaments/euroleague-2017/statistic#fails Source]</small>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|50em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.beachsoccer.com/ Beach Soccer Worldwide] (organisers' official website)\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/news/the-euro-beach-soccer-league-bigger-and-better-than-ever Announcement & format]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/events/euro-beach-soccer-league-belgrade-2017 Stage 1, Belgrade]\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/events/euro-beach-soccer-league-sanxenxo-2017 Stage 2, Nazar\u00e9]\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/events/euro-beach-soccer-league-moscow-2017 Stage 3, Moscow]\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/events/euro-beach-soccer-league-siofok-2017 Stage 4, Si\u00f3fok]\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/events/euro-beach-soccer-league-warnemunde-2017 Stage 5, Warnem\u00fcnde]\n* [http://beachsoccer.com/events/euro-beach-soccer-league-superfinal-promotion-final-italy-2017 Superfinal]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Euro Beach Soccer League}}\n{{International Beach Soccer}}\n\n[[Category:Euro Beach Soccer League]]\n[[Category:2017 in beach soccer]]\n[[Category:2017 in Serbian sport]]\n[[Category:2017 in Portuguese sport]]\n[[Category:2017 in Russian sport]]\n[[Category:2017 in Hungarian sport]]\n[[Category:2017 in German sport]]\n[[Category:2017 in Italian sport]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Euro_Beach_Soccer_League"}

Founded in 1965 in the town of [[Michigan City, Indiana]] U.S.A., Sullair has manufacturing facilities in Michigan City that distribute and service air compressor packages and systems worldwide. Sullair also has manufacturing facilities in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]] [[China]] that service the Asian and [[Australasia]]n markets. Sullair also has offices in Dandenong South, [[Australia]] near [[Melbourne]], and in Sunderland, United Kingdom that services markets in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Russia.\n\nIn April 2017, [[Hitachi]] acquired Sullair for 1,245 million USD.<ref>[http://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=ind&k=2017042501005 Hitachi to Acquire U.S. Industrial Machinery Maker Sullair]</ref>\n\n==Sullair and Rotary Screw Technology==\n'''[[Rotary screw compressor|The Rotary Screw Compressor]]'''<br />\nAlthough the first commercial application of a fluid injected rotary screw compressor was accomplished by Swedish industrial manufacturer [[Atlas Copco]] in 1957, it was Sullair's founding president, Don Hoode, that introduced the technology to the U.S. domestic market in 1966. And by 1969, Sullair had developed an entire line of portable and stationary asymmetric rotary screw air compressors.<ref>[Royce N. Brown. \"Compressors: Selection & Sizing\"], p.p. 127-128. Elsevier Inc, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-7506-7545-4}}.</ref>  Hoode purchased the use of the technology from Swedish firm Svenska Rotor Maskiner, whose retired chief engineer, Alf Lysholm, invented the twin-screw compressor in 1934 while developing gas turbines. The Lysholm design is also used in vehicles to force air induction into engine cylinders, supercharging both gas and diesel powered engines to boost engine performance.<ref>Sandhyarani, Ningthoujam. [http://www.whipplesuperchargers.com/content.asp?PageID=80 \"The History of Screw Compressors\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620155502/http://www.whipplesuperchargers.com/content.asp?PageID=80 |date=2014-06-20 }}, www.whipplesuperchargers.com, Retrieved on 1 May 2014.</ref> Today, rotary screw compressors are the most popular type of air compressor in operation worldwide. Sullair's leadership decision to stay exclusively with the rotary screw technology when others still relied on piston driven technology, proved to be a valuable decision for the company, and was significant in its growth within the industry.\n\n==Sullair Products==\nToday, Sullair has three primary product families -\n*Portable Air Power - For markets where mobility of the compressor equipment is critical. Compressors are designed with on-board diesel engines as the power source, and most models made are towable or can be placed on work vehicles. These compressor packages are designed for ruggedness and reliability in order to withstand the physical burden of portability.\n*Stationary Air Power - Compressor systems that are designed to be placed in a fixed position. Because compressed air is such a high demand \u2033utility\u2033 among a large variety of markets, most stationary compressor installations are highly customized to fit each application. For this reason stationary air compressors and their associated after treatment products are part of a whole system design and are often configured into a facility's architecture.\n*Original Equipment Manufactured (OEM) Components - Highly customized Sullair compressor units and portable air compressors are built to customer supplied requirements and specifications for inclusion in larger assemblies. OEM products serve the Drill, Process Gas, and Offshore Platform markets.\n\n==Sullair History==\n*1965: Donald C. Hoodes departed the Joy Manufacturing Company, a Pittsburgh-based manufacturer of mining and reciprocal compressor equipment, and founded a privately held company under the name of the Sullivan Machinery Company in Michigan City Indiana.<ref>[Roger A. Stafford. \"Sullair Major Force in Compressor Marketplace\"], Milwaukee Sentinel, 5 September 1977.</ref> Hoodes as President brings with him from Joy Manufacturing Roger Gustafson, Borje Vagenius, and C.J. Joseph as Vice Presidents. Hoodes acquires a license to market the rotary screw technology from Svenska Rotor Maskiner AB (SRC) of Sweden. \n*1966: The Sullivan Machinery Company ships its first 150 CFM portable air compressor in April 1966. The company was the first in the domestic market to completely rely on rotary screw technology.\n*1968: The first stationary compressor rolls off the line. The Sullivan Machinery Company changes its business name to Sullair Corporation.\n*1969: Sullair headquarters and manufacturing facilities moves to 3700 East Michigan Blvd., Michigan City Indiana. Its main U.S. factory is still at this address today.\n*1972: Sullair becomes a public corporation in March 1972, trading under the symbol SULL. A subsidiary is established in Australia to sell products made in Michigan City. Added track-mounted rock drills and refrigeration compressors to the line of products.\n*1973: A cash infusion from the public offering allows the building of a new fabrication plant to manufacture rotors. Added a 40,000 sq ft warehouse and a 7,000 sq ft office expansion.\n*1974: Sullair grants a license to a major Japanese company to manufacture compressors for sale in Japan and South Korea.\n*1975: First to develop a totally synthetic lifetime compressor fluid called 24KT. Replacement of the fluid is virtually eliminated because of its resistance to breakdown. Sullair extended its warranty from two years to ten years on 24KT machines based on this new fluid technology.\n*1977: Introduces the EES (Energy Efficiency System) heat recovery system. Sullair Asia is established in Singapore.\n*1978: A joint venture establishes Sullair in Argentina.\n*1979: Introduces oil-free dry screw compressor line.\n*1980: Establishes the Sullair Mining Equipment Company to produce a line of underground drilling equipment.\n*1981: Sullair is listed on the NYSE under the stock symbol SUL.\n*1982: Introduces two-stage \"tandem\" air compressors. Sullair opens a new facility in Houston Texas to expand from air compressors to gas compressors to serve the hydrocarbon and chemical processing industries.\n*1984: Sullair is purchased by the [[Sundstrand Corporation]] in October 1984.\n*1985: Introduces a full line of pneumatic hand tools to complement their portable air compressor line. \n*1988: First Encapsulated compressor system combines motor, compressor unit, cooling unit, and air-fluid separator all into one fixed component.\n*1994: Enters China market with joint venture that creates the Shenzhen Sullair Asia Company, Ltd.\n*1999: [[United Technologies|United Technologies, Inc.]] (UTC) purchases Sundstrand Corporation and merges operations with Hamilton Standard to form the [[Hamilton Sundstrand]] business unit.

Founded in 1965 in the town of [[Michigan City, Indiana]] U.S.A., Sullair has manufacturing facilities in Michigan City that distribute and service air compressor packages and systems worldwide. Sullair also has manufacturing facilities in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]] [[China]] that service the Asian and [[Australasia]]n markets. Sullair also has offices in Dandenong South, [[Australia]] near [[Melbourne]], and in Sunderland, United Kingdom that services markets in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Russia.\n\nIn April 2017, [[Hitachi]] acquired Sullair for 1,245 million USD.<ref>[http://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=ind&k=2017042501005 Hitachi to Acquire U.S. Industrial Machinery Maker Sullair]</ref>\n\n==Sullair and Rotary Screw Technology==\n'''[[Rotary screw compressor|The Rotary Screw Compressor]]'''<br />\nAlthough the first commercial application of a fluid injected rotary screw compressor was accomplished by Swedish industrial manufacturer [[Atlas Copco]] in 1957, it was Sullair's founding president, Don Hoode, that introduced the technology to the U.S. domestic market in 1966. And by 1969, Sullair had developed an entire line of portable and stationary asymmetric rotary screw air compressors.<ref>[Royce N. Brown. \"Compressors: Selection & Sizing\"], p.p. 127-128.

Sullair's leadership decision to stay exclusively with the rotary screw technology when others still relied on piston driven technology, proved to be a valuable decision for the company, and was significant in its growth within the industry.\n\n==Sullair Products==\nToday, Sullair has three primary product families -\n*Portable Air Power - For markets where mobility of the compressor equipment is critical. Compressors are designed with on-board diesel engines as the power source, and most models made are towable or can be placed on work vehicles. These compressor packages are designed for ruggedness and reliability in order to withstand the physical burden of portability.\n*Stationary Air Power - Compressor systems that are designed to be placed in a fixed position. Because compressed air is such a high demand \u2033utility\u2033 among a large variety of markets, most stationary compressor installations are highly customized to fit each application. For this reason stationary air compressors and their associated aftertreatment products are part of a whole system design and are often configured into a facility's architecture.\n*Original Equipment Manufactured (OEM) Components - Highly customized Sullair compressor units and portable air compressors are built to customer supplied requirements and specifications for inclusion in larger assemblies. OEM products serve the Drill, Process Gas, and Offshore Platform markets.\n\n==Sullair History==\n*1965: Donald C.

{"title_page": "Papiria (gens)", "text_new": "The '''gens Papiria''' was an ancient [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family at [[ancient Rome|Rome]].  According to tradition, the Papirii had already achieved prominence in the time of the [[Roman kingdom|kings]], and the first [[Rex Sacrorum]] was a member of this [[gens]].  [[Lucius Papirius Mugillanus]] was the first of the Papirii to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 444 BC.  The patrician members of the family regularly occupied the highest offices of the Roman state down to the time of the [[Punic Wars]].  Most of the Papirii who held office under the later [[Roman Republic|Republic]] belonged to various [[plebs|plebeian]] branches of the family.  Although the most illustrious Papirii flourished in the time of the Republic, a number of the family continued to hold high office during the first two centuries of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 118 (\"Papiria Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n[[Cicero]] described the history of the Papirii to his friend, Papirius Paetus, a plebeian member of the family, who was unaware of the patrician origin of the family.  According to Cicero, the Papirii were one of the ''gentes minores'', the lesser of two divisions made amongst the patrician gentes at Rome.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\">Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Familiares'', ix. 21.</ref>  The ''gentes maiores'' were the greatest or most noble patrician houses, while the rest of the patrician families made up the ''gentes minores''.  The precise distinction between the two divisions is not known, nor have any lists of the families belonging to each survived from antiquity.  However, it has been suggested that the ''gentes maiores'' consisted, at least in part, of the families who came to Rome in the time of [[Romulus]], while the ''gentes minores'' consisted of the patrician families that were enrolled after the destruction of [[Alba Longa]], or under the Tarquins.<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe original form of the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]] ''Papirius'' was ''Papisius'', and all of the early Papirii would have been known by this name, although in later times they were always referred to as Papirii.  A number of other ancient nomina experienced the same evolution; ''Fusius'' becoming ''Furius'', ''Valesius'' becoming ''Valerius'', and ''Vetusius'' becoming ''Veturius''.  Cicero writes that the first of the Papirii to adopt the \"modern\" spelling was Lucius Papirius Crassus, consul in BC 336.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief [[praenomen|praenomina]] of the Papirii during the Republic were ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]], [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]], [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]], [[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]]'', and ''[[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]''.  The first three were the most common of all Roman names, while ''Manius'' and ''Spurius'' were much more distinctive.  The only other praenomina found among the patrician Papirii are ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'', and perhaps ''[[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]]'' or ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]]'', known from individual instances, but only ''Publius'' is known from the other members of the gens.  The plebeian Papirii Carbones used primarily ''Gaius'' and ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]''; this last was a common name not found among the ancient patrician stirpes, but which was still used by the Papirii of imperial times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nFrom at least the time of the early Republic, the Papirii are divided into a number of branches, or ''stirpes'', distinguished by their surnames.  Cicero lists the patrician [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the Papirii as ''Crassus, Cursor, Maso'', and ''Mugillanus'', while the plebeian families included those of ''Carbo, Paetus'', and ''Turdus''.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe Papirii Mugillani were the first of these families to obtain the consulship.  Their surname was derived from an ancient city of [[Latium]] known as ''Mugilla'', the ancestral home of the Papirii.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1119 (\"Mugillanus\").</ref>  According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], Mugilla was conquered by [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]] after he was banished from Rome and went over to the [[Volsci]].<ref>Dionysius, viii. 36.</ref>  It must have been in the vicinity of the Volscian towns of [[Pollusca]] and [[Corioli]], but it was evidently deserted at a very early date, as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] does not mention it among his list of former cities in Latium.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography'', vol. II, p. 376 (\"Mugilla\").</ref>\n\nThe Papirii Crassi appear almost simultaneously with the Mugillani, and remained a distinct family down to the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]].  Their surname, ''Crassus'', which means \"thick\" or \"fat\", was common to a number of prominent gentes, including the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]] and the [[Licinia (gens)|Licinii]].<ref>Chase, p. 110.</ref>\n\n''Cursor'', the surname of the third branch of the Papirii to achieve prominence, means \"a runner\", and was probably bestowed upon the ancestor of the family because of his speed.  The Papirii Cursores appear in history from the early fourth century BC to the beginning of the third.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 904, 905 (\"Cursor\").</ref>\n\nThe surname ''Maso'', sometimes spelled ''Masso'', is derived from the [[Latin]] ''massa'', a \"mass\" or \"lump\".<ref>Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. masso''.</ref>  The Papirii Masones were the last of the distinct patrician families of this gens, although some of the other Papirii were also patricians, including Lucius Papirius Praetextatus, [[Roman censor|censor]] in 272 BC.  The Masones occur from the end of the fourth century BC down to the time of Cicero.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 970 (\"Maso\").</ref><ref name=\"Broughton I 198\">Broughton, vol. I, p. 198.</ref>\n\nAmong the plebeian branches of the Papiria gens, the most important was that surnamed ''Carbo'', referring to a piece of coal or charcoal; metaphorically, something black, or of little value.<ref name=\"Chase 113\">Chase, p. 113.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. carbo, coal''.</ref>  The Papirii Carbones appear in the first half of the second century BC, and continued down to the time of Cicero.<ref name=\"DGRBM Carbo\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 610\u2013612 (\"Carbo\").</ref>\n\n''Paetus'', the surname of Cicero's plebeian friend, referred to a mild defect of vision, variously described as \"blink-eyed\", or \"squinty\".  This common cognomen implied a lesser deficit than ''Strabo'', \"squinty\", ''Luscus'', \"one-eyed\", or ''Caecus'', \"blind\", and could even be regarded as endearing; it was an epithet of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].<ref>Chase, p. 109.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. paetus, caecus, luscus, strabo''.</ref><ref>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

According to tradition, the Papirii had already achieved prominence in the time of the [[Roman kingdom|kings]], and the first [[Rex Sacrorum]] was a member of this [[gens]].  [[Lucius Papirius Mugillanus]] was the first of the Papirii to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 444 BC.  The patrician members of the family regularly occupied the highest offices of the Roman state down to the time of the [[Punic Wars]].  Most of the Papirii who held office under the later [[Roman Republic|Republic]] belonged to various [[plebs|plebeian]] branches of the family.  Although the most illustrious Papirii flourished in the time of the Republic, a number of the family continued to hold high office during the first two centuries of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 118 (\"Papiria Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n[[Cicero]] described the history of the Papirii to his friend, Papirius Paetus, a plebeian member of the family, who was unaware of the patrician origin of the family.  According to Cicero, the Papirii were one of the ''gentes minores'', the lesser of two divisions made amongst the patrician gentes at Rome.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\">Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Familiares'', ix. 21.</ref>  The ''gentes maiores'' were the greatest or most noble patrician houses, while the rest of the patrician families made up the ''gentes minores''.  The precise distinction between the two divisions is not known, nor have any lists of the families belonging to each survived from antiquity.  However, it has been suggested that the ''gentes maiores'' consisted, at least in part, of the families who came to Rome in the time of [[Romulus]], while the ''gentes minores'' consisted of the patrician families that were enrolled after the destruction of [[Alba Longa]], or under the Tarquins.<ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\nThe original form of the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]] ''Papirius'' was ''Papisius'', and all of the early Papirii would have been known by this name, although in later times they were always referred to as Papirii.  A number of other ancient nomina experienced the same evolution; ''Fusius'' becoming ''Furius'', ''Valesius'' becoming ''Valerius'', and ''Vetusius'' becoming ''Veturius''.  Cicero writes that the first of the Papirii to adopt the \"modern\" spelling was Lucius Papirius Crassus, consul in BC 336.<ref name=\"Cicero ad Fam ix 21\"/><ref name=\"DGRBM Papiria Gens\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief [[praenomen|praenomina]] of the Papirii during the Republic were ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]], [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]], [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]], [[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]]'', and ''[[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]''.  The first three were the most common of all Roman names, while ''Manius'' and ''Spurius'' were much more distinctive.  The only other praenomina found among the patrician Papirii are ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'', and perhaps ''[[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]]'' or ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]]'', known from individual instances, but only ''Publius'' is known from the other members of the gens.  The plebeian Papirii Carbones used primarily ''Gaius'' and ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]''; this last was a common name not found among the ancient patrician stirpes, but which was still used by the Papirii of imperial times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nFrom at least the time of the early Republic, the Papirii are divided into a number of branches, or ''stirpes'', distinguished by their surnames.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio.

Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis.

When Bolt pulled out in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, Dune passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]].

Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo.

Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003.

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, Guillermo Del Toro was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. Time constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined.<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. A similarly labyrinthine project, Dune passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]] (who released a film adaptation in 1984), [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] (who directed a TV miniseries in 2000), [[Peter Berg]], [[Pierre Morel]] and finally to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\n\n</ref>\n\nDenis next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program.

He serves as interim head coach of the [[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===High school===\nA native of Pasadena, California, Vaughn attended [[John Muir High School]] in nearby [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], where he maintained a 3.94 GPA in honors and AP courses,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and became the best high school player in that area since former Muir and NBA standout [[Stacey Augmon]]. Vaughn excelled both on and off the court, and by his senior year was ranked as high as the no. 7 high school recruit in the country and the no. 2 point guard in the class of 1993 behind arguably the nation's top player that year, [[Randy Livingston]]. Over the course of the season, Vaughn averaged over 21 points and 19 assists per game, while also compiling six [[triple-doubles]]. Named a First-Team All-American by nearly every publication on the market, Vaughn rounded off his special season with a selection to participate in the prestigious [[McDonald's All-American Game]] where he put on a show, scoring only 6 points but amassing 13 assists (still a McDonald's record), while also thoroughly outplaying the higher-ranked Livingston once again\u2014this time on a national stage (they had both matched up against each other in the All-Star Game of the 1992 Nike Camp), and was named co-MVP with [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]]'s [[Jerry Stackhouse]] in the process. After considering [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]], [[UNLV]], [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] and [[UCLA]], Vaughn decided to play for coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] at [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], continuing, along with fellow recruit and college roommate [[Scot Pollard]], the California pipeline of high school hoopsters to [[Lawrence, Kansas]], started by former standouts [[Adonis Jordan]] and [[Rex Walters]], and continuing in later years with [[Paul Pierce]], and [[Eric Chenowith]].\n\nAs a senior in high school in 1993, Vaughn was awarded the [[Dial Award]] as the nation's top male high school scholar-athlete, becoming the first basketball player ever to win that award.\n\n===College===\nIn his college career Vaughn became the starting point guard as a freshman after being chosen to replace incumbent starter Calvin Rayford. Among his first-year highlights were earning the MVP award at the 1993 Pre-Season NIT at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] and hitting a game-winning three pointer at the overtime buzzer to beat Indiana in an early season game at [[Allen Fieldhouse]].<ref>{{cite web |title=College Basketball Roundup: Vaughn's Shoy Lifts No. 6 Kansas Over Indiana |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-12-23-sp-4783-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 9, 2020 |date=December 23, 1993}}</ref> Throughout his four years at Kansas, Vaughn was known as a good distributor of the basketball and effective defender with great speed and court awareness. By the end of his college career, he was the all-time leader in assists in Kansas basketball history with 804 total (since surpassed by [[Aaron Miles (basketball)|Aaron Miles]]), as well as the Big Eight Conference's all-time record holder. In 1997, the award given annually to the school's assist leader was renamed to include Vaughn, Miles and original assists leader, [[Cedric Hunter]], as the Hunter/Vaughn/Miles Assists Award.\n\nVaughn earned a 3.72 GPA as a Business Administration major.<ref>{{cite news|title=BHSN: Orlando Magic hire Jacque Vaughn as new head coach|url=http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/sports/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2012/7/28/bhsn_orlando_magic_h.html|newspaper=Central Florida News|date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> He was a two-time Academic All-American at Kansas and the 1997 GTE Academic All-American of the Year. He was also a two-time all-conference pick and was named the [[Big Eight Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big Eight Player of the Year]] in 1996. His college jersey was retired on December 31, 2002 and hangs in the rafters of [[Allen Fieldhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacque Vaughn|work=KUSports.com|url=http://6news.kusports.com/intherafters/vaughn.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221100929/http://6news.kusports.com/intherafters/vaughn.html|archivedate=December 21, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Professional===\nIn 1997, Vaughn was selected 27th overall by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. In addition to playing four seasons in Utah, Vaughn also played with the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Atlanta Hawks]] (in two separate stints), [[New Jersey Nets]], and [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He appeared in 64 games for the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs during the 2006\u201307 season and finished his career there, retiring after the 2008\u201309 season. Over his career, he averaged 4.5 points per game and 2.5 assists per game.

player. He serves as interim head coach of the [[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===High school===\nA native of Pasadena, California, Vaughn attended [[John Muir High School]] in nearby [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], where he maintained a 3.94 GPA in honors and AP courses,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and became the best high school player in that area since former Muir and NBA standout [[Stacey Augmon]]. Vaughn excelled both on and off the court, and by his senior year was ranked as high as the no. 7 high school recruit in the country and the no. 2 point guard in the class of 1993 behind arguably the nation's top player that year, [[Randy Livingston]]. Over the course of the season, Vaughn averaged over 21 points and 19 assists per game, while also compiling six [[triple-doubles]]. Named a First-Team All-American by nearly every publication on the market, Vaughn rounded off his special season with a selection to participate in the prestigious [[McDonald's All-American Game]] where he put on a show, scoring only 6 points but amassing 13 assists (still a McDonald's record), while also thoroughly outplaying the higher-ranked Livingston once again\u2014this time on a national stage (they had both matched up against each other in the All-Star Game of the 1992 Nike Camp), and was named co-MVP with [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]]'s [[Jerry Stackhouse]] in the process. After considering [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]], [[UNLV]], [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] and [[UCLA]], Vaughn decided to play for coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] at [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], continuing, along with fellow recruit and college roommate [[Scot Pollard]], the California pipeline of high school hoopsters to [[Lawrence, Kansas]], started by former standouts [[Adonis Jordan]] and [[Rex Walters]], and continuing in later years with [[Paul Pierce]], and [[Eric Chenowith]].\n\nAs a senior in high school in 1993, Vaughn was awarded the [[Dial Award]] as the nation's top male high school scholar-athlete, becoming the first basketball player ever to win that award.\n\n===College===\nIn his college career Vaughn became the starting point guard as a freshman after being chosen to replace incumbent starter Calvin Rayford. Among his first-year highlights were earning the MVP award at the 1993 Pre-Season NIT at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] and hitting a game-winning three pointer at the overtime buzzer to beat Indiana in an early season game at [[Allen Fieldhouse]].<ref>{{cite web |title=College Baketball Roundup: Vaughn's Shoy Lifts No. 6 Kansas Over Indiana |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-12-23-sp-4783-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 9, 2020 |date=December 23, 1993}}</ref> Throughout his four years at Kansas, Vaughn was known as a good distributor of the basketball and effective defender with great speed and court awareness. By the end of his college career, he was the all-time leader in assists in Kansas basketball history with 804 total (since surpassed by [[Aaron Miles (basketball)|Aaron Miles]]), as well as the Big Eight Conference's all-time record holder. In 1997, the award given annually to the school's assist leader was renamed to include Vaughn, Miles and original assists leader, [[Cedric Hunter]], as the Hunter/Vaughn/Miles Assists Award.\n\nVaughn earned a 3.72 GPA as a Business Administration major.<ref>{{cite news|title=BHSN: Orlando Magic hire Jacque Vaughn as new head coach|url=http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/sports/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2012/7/28/bhsn_orlando_magic_h.html|newspaper=Central Florida News|date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> He was a two-time Academic All-American at Kansas and the 1997 GTE Academic All-American of the Year. He was also a two-time all-conference pick and was named the [[Big Eight Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big Eight Player of the Year]] in 1996. His college jersey was retired on December 31, 2002 and hangs in the rafters of [[Allen Fieldhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacque Vaughn|work=KUSports.com|url=http://6news.kusports.com/intherafters/vaughn.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221100929/http://6news.kusports.com/intherafters/vaughn.html|archivedate=December 21, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Professional===\nIn 1997, Vaughn was selected 27th overall by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. In addition to playing four seasons in Utah, Vaughn also played with the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Atlanta Hawks]] (in two separate stints), [[New Jersey Nets]], and [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He appeared in 64 games for the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs during the 2006\u201307 season and finished his career there, retiring after the 2008\u201309 season.

Hammersley won a scholarship to [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] to train as a deck officer but his eyesight was too poor so he chose to become an engineer instead, studying at the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]].  He trained onboard [[HMS Frobisher (D81)|HMS ''Frobisher'']] and [[HMS Duke of York (17)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] and served on  [[HMS Ocean (R68)|HMS ''Ocean'']] during the [[Korean War]].  Hammersley later specialised in submarines and in 1959 served on secondment to the [[US Navy]] on the nuclear submarine [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|''Nautilus'']].  Afterwards he served as nuclear engineering officer aboard the Royal Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, [[HMS Dreadnought (S101)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']].  Hammersley helped design the [[Swiftsure-class submarine|''Swiftsure''-class of submarines]]  and commanded a number of shore installations including the Royal Naval Engineering College.  He served as [[aide-de-camp]] to Queen Elizabeth II and was Chief Staff Officer Engineering for the fleet in the 1982 [[Falklands War]].  After retirement he served in roles in a number of commercial and charitable organisations.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A30080.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Duke of York'']]\nPeter Gerald Hammersley was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], Staffordshire on 18 May 1928.<ref name=times/>  His father Robert had been severely wounded in action during the [[First World War]] and died when Peter was 17.  His mother Nora was a school secretary and was able to find enough money for Peter and his brother David to receive a private education at [[Denstone College]].<ref name=times/>  Hammersley would have been nicknamed \"Ham\" from his surname but this was amended to \"[[Spam]]\" owing to the shortage of ham during [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|wartime rationing]] and the relative availability of the processed meat.  Hammersley won a scholarship to [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], Dartmouth to train as a naval command (or deck) officer.  Poor eyesight prevented him from taking up this opportunity but he was able to switch to the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]], [[Manadon]] from which he awarded a first class degree.  Hammersley gained seagoing experience aboard the training cruiser [[HMS Frobisher (D81)|''Frobisher'']] as a cadet.<ref name=tel/>\n\nHammersley served on active duty aboard the battleship [[HMS Duke of York (17)|''Duke of York'']], where he completed his training in engineering in 1948.<ref name=tel/>  He was promoted from acting rank to substantive [[sub-lieutenant]] (engineering) on 1 March 1949.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38556|date=8 March 1949|page=1204 }}</ref>  He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] (engineering) on 22 November 1950 and during the [[Korean War]] (1950-53) served aboard the aircraft carrier [[HMS Ocean (R68)|''Ocean'']].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39084|date=5 December 1950|page=6074}}</ref><ref name=tel/>  Hammersley specialised in submarines from 1954.<ref name=tel/>\n\n== Nuclear engineering ==\n[[File:USS Skipjack SSN585.jpg|thumb|USS ''Skipjack'']]\nIn the late 1950s [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]], as First Sea Lord was keen that the Royal Navy acquire nuclear submarines, such as those fielded by the US Navy.  These vessels had the advantage over traditional diesel-electric models in that they could remain submerged for long patrols (the the world's first nuclear submarine, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], demonstrated this capability with a well publicised cruise beneath the ice of the North Pole in 1958).<ref name=times/><ref name=tel/> Mountbatten met with US Navy admiral and \"father of the nuclear navy\" [[Hyman G. Rickover]] to discuss the provision of expertise to a British nuclear submarine programme.  Rickover agreed to provide Royal Navy officers with seagoing experience on US nuclear submarines but insisted on selecting the officers that would take part.  Mountbatten refused this caveat and insisted on selecting the men himself.  One of those chosen was Hammersley who, in 1957, was summoned from [[Imperial College London]], where he was studying for a diploma in nuclear engineering, to meet with Mountbatten and Rickover.  Rickover was apparently disinterested but Hammersley was approved to travel to the US to take part in the programme.<ref name=tel/>\n\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (S101) after launch 1960.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]\nHammersley was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 26 September 1958 and afterwards served aboard the [[USS Skipjack (SSN-585)|USS ''Skipjack'']], commissioned in April 1959, under Commander (and future Vice-Admiral) [[W.

Hammersley won a scholarship to [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] to train as a deck officer but his eyesight was too poor so he chose to become an engineer instead, studying at the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]].  He trained onboard [[HMS Frobisher (D81)|HMS ''Frobisher'']] and [[HMS Duke of York (17)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] and served on  [[HMS Ocean (R68)|HMS ''Ocean'']] during the [[Korean War]].  Hammersley later specialised in submarines and in 1959 served on secondment to the [[US Navy]] on the nuclear submarine [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|''Nautilus'']].  Afterwards he served as nuclear engineering officer aboard the Royal Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, [[HMS Dreadnought (S101)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']].  Hammersley helped design the [[Swiftsure-class submarine|''Swiftsure''-class of submarines]]  and commanded a number of shore installations including the Royal Naval Engineering College.  He served as [[aide-de-camp]] to Queen Elizabeth II and was Chief Staff Officer Engineering for the fleet in the 1982 [[Falklands War]].  After retirement he served in roles in a number of commercial and charitable organisations.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A30080.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Duke of York'']]\nPeter Gerald Hammersley was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], Staffordshire on 18 May 1928.<ref name=times/>  His father Robert had been severely wounded in action during the [[First World War]] and died when Peter was 17.  His mother Nora was a school secretary and was able to find enough money for Peter and his brother David to receive a private education at [[Denstone College]].<ref name=times/>  Hammersley would have been nicknamed \"ham\" from his surname but this was amended to \"[[Spam]]\" owing to the shortage of ham during [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|wartime rationing]] and the relative availability of the processed meat.  Hammersley won a scholarship to [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], Dartmouth to train as a naval command (or deck) officer.  Poor eyesight prevented him from taking up this opportunity but he was able to switch to the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]], [[Manadon]] from which he awarded a first class degree.  Hammersley gained seagoing experience aboard the training cruiser [[HMS Frobisher (D81)|''Frobisher'']] as a cadet.<ref name=tel/>\n\nHammersley served on active duty aboard the battleship [[HMS Duke of York (17)|''Duke of York'']], where he completed his training in engineering in 1948.<ref name=tel/>  He was promoted from acting rank to substantive [[sub-lieutenant]] (engineering) on 1 March 1949.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38556|date=8 March 1949|page=1204 }}</ref>  He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] (engineering) on 22 November 1950 and during the [[Korean War]] (1950-53) served aboard the aircraft carrier [[HMS Ocean (R68)|''Ocean'']].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39084|date=5 December 1950|page=6074}}</ref><ref name=tel/>  Hammersley specialised in submarines from 1954.<ref name=tel/>\n\n== Nuclear engineering ==\n[[File:USS Skipjack SSN585.jpg|thumb|USS ''Skipjack'']]\nIn the late 1950s [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]], as First Sea Lord was keen that the Royal Navy acquire nuclear submarines, such as those fielded by the US Navy.  These vessels had the advantage over traditional diesel-electric models in that they could remain submerged for long patrols (the the world's first nuclear submarine, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], demonstrated this capability with a well publicised cruise beneath the ice of the North Pole in 1958).<ref name=times/><ref name=tel/> Mountbatten met with US Navy admiral and \"father of the nuclear navy\" [[Hyman G. Rickover]] to discuss the provision of expertise to a British nuclear submarine programme.  Rickover agreed to provide Royal Navy officers with seagoing experience on US nuclear submarines but insisted on selecting the officers that would take part.  Mountbatten refused this caveat and insisted on selecting the men himself.  One of those chosen was Hammersley who, in 1957, was summoned from [[Imperial College London]], where he was studying for a diploma in nuclear engineering, to meet with Mountbatten and Rickover.  Rickover was apparently disinterested but Hammersley was approved to travel to the US to take part in the programme.<ref name=tel/>\n\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (S101) after launch 1960.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]\nHammersley was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 26 September 1958 and afterwards served aboard the [[USS Skipjack (SSN-585)|USS ''Skipjack'']], commissioned in April 1959, under Commander (and future Vice-Admiral) [[W.

'''Young Nats''', is the youth wing of the [[New Zealand National Party]], a centre-right political party in New Zealand, and a member of the [[International Young Democrat Union]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe National Party has had a youth section since its inception in 1936, and are a constituted youth wing of the National Party.<ref>{{Cite

been a strong lobby group inside the National Party, and often at the forefront of policy development being representative as a ''Core Group'' or a ''Policy Action Group'' of the party at varying times. For a short period during the party's earlier years there was a younger section of the National party for pre-teenage members but has since disappeared due to the changing environment of New Zealand politics and society.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nPrior to the group being named the Young Nationals, the New Zealand [[New Zealand National Party|National Party's]] Youth section was known as the Junior Nationals.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In the lead up to the 1949 election, the  Wellington branch had 3,500 members and the Auckland branch consisted of 2,500 members.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=256}} The group hosted a number of community events such as dances, parties, debating/discussion, and Lectures/addresses. In 1967 the group voted to change the name to the Young Nationals as Junior Nationals was seen to have potentially negative connotations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} This renamed group attracted members for political reasons rather than social activities like its predecessor.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} In 1968 the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] agreed to for two Young Nationals to sit on the party's Dominion Council.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=262}} 1971 brought upon Young Nationals creating political discussion groups called 'Pol Link's' which enabled the group to research and discuss political issues allowing the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] to understand the contemporary issues of young generations.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=263}} In 2015 the Young Nationals claimed to have over 20,000 [[Facebook likes|likes]] on their Facebook page and over 6,000 official members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=National at 80 Years: The Story of the New Zealand National Party|last=James|first=Colin|publisher=Bateman|year=2017|isbn=|location=Auckland|page=283}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nIn 2009, under major changes led by the organisation's governing executive, the Young Nationals were re-organised to serve as a more effective tool for policy activism and campaign activity.\n\n===Regional Teams===\n\nAs of 2011, The Young Nationals are divided into five regions nationwide:\n\n* Northern; \n* Central North Island; \n* Lower North Island; \n* Canterbury-Westland; and\n* Southern.\n\nEach of these regions are headed by their own Chair and executive group and supervised by a National Executive, elected annually during the National Party Conference.\n\nSome regions of the Young Nationals also may have branches. These include the ''Alfred Street Young Nationals'',<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/alfredstreetnational |title= Alfred Street Young Nationals}}</ref> which are based in Auckland and considered a counter group to the [[Princes Street Labour]] movement and ''VicNats''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/VicNats/127981860617677 |title=VicNats}}</ref> which is based around [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]].

There are currently 12 members. They are made of a:\n\n* President;\n* Vice-President;\n* Secretary;\n* Treasurer;\n* Policy Chair;\n* Creative Director; and\n* The Chairs of each of the Regional Executives<ref>https://youngnats.national.org.nz/your_team</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== Regional Events ===\nThroughout the year each of the five Regions teams have a range of social events. These include, but are not limited to, coffee catch ups with MPs, Social drinks and pub quizzes. Events are usually centred around the academic timetables of the universities in the regions. Additionally, regions will often host Christmas parties and Policy-based events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/NZYoungNats/events|title=NZ Young Nats|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/NRYoungNats/events|title=Northern Young Nats|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/YoungNatsSouthern/events|title=Southern Young Nats|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/cniyoungnats/events|title=CNI Young Nats|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/CanterburyWestlandYoungNationals/events|title=CW Young Nats|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/LNIYoungNats/events|title=Lower North Island Young Nats|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Balls ===\nFrom time to time the Young Nationals have organised balls.

This conference is an opportunity for members from across the country to network, discuss policy issues and learn to campaign. In 2018, the Conference was held in Nelson, and was followed by a conference in Wellington in 2019 and Queenstown in 2020. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.national.org.nz/2018_annual_conference_book|title=2018 Annual Conference|website=NZ National Party|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=NZ Young Nats on Facebook Watch|url=https://www.facebook.com/NZYoungNats/videos/538490229992183/|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://youngnats.national.org.nz/turning_up_the_hype_down_south|title=Turning up the hype, down south|website=Young Nats|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Policies==\nOften the more liberal views of the Young Nationals have been at odds with those of the wider party. The shift in party opinion in areas such as the nuclear ships debate, economic reform, liquor law reform, and anti-discrimination laws has often been influenced by the Young Nationals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youngnats.national.org.nz/our_story|title=Our Story|website=Young Nats|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===Drug Policy===\n\n==== Alcohol ====\nThe Young Nationals, in conjunction with other New Zealand political party youth wings,<ref>[http://www.keepit18.org.nz Keep it 18]</ref> support the current purchase age for alcohol of 18 years.
