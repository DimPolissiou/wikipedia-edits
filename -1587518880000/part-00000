A mosque, built during the Moorish rule of the Iberian Peninsula, was originally located in its current place, and was later mostly restructured and converted into a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] cathedral after the [[Reconquista]].<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/137398/Mosque-Cathedral-of-Cordoba</ref> Although having some [[Baroque]] characteristics, it is mostly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in nature and it is considered to be the main Gothic monument in the Algarve and one of the most important landmarks in southern Portugal.

In the process of the [[Reconquista]], Moorish Silves was conquered in 1189 by [[Sancho I of Portugal|King Sancho I of Portugal]], but since the city was retaken by the Moors in 1191, it is unlikely that a cathedral was built at this time. Only in 1242 was Silves definitely reconquered by Christian knights during the reign of [[Afonso III of Portugal|King Afonso III]], and it is believed that this king was responsible for beginning the construction of Silves Cathedral as the seat of a newly founded Algarve diocese.\n\nThe works proceeded with difficulty, and in 1352 the cathedral was damaged by a strong [[earthquake]]. In the 1440s, the cathedral workshop was given a great impulse by [[Afonso V of Portugal|King Afonso V]]. This building campaign produced the [[apse]] with its three chapels, the [[transept]] and the main portal, in Gothic style, dating from the 1470s. The three-[[aisle]]d [[nave]] was only finished in the early 16th century.\n\nWhen [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] died unexpectedly in Alvor ([[Portim\u00e3o]]), near Silves, in 1495, he was provisionally buried in the main chapel of Silves Cathedral. In 1499, in the presence of [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]], his remains were exhumed and transferred to the [[Monastery of Batalha]], where John II was permanently re-buried; however, his tomb slab with a Gothic inscription is still located on the floor of the main chapel of Silves Cathedral. Many important personalities of Silves, from nobility to crusaders, explorers, bishops and judges as well as local inhabitants from different walks of life were buried in the cathedral during the 15th and 16th centuries, as attested by the many tomb slabs on its floor, some of the most notable ones being Bishop D. Fernando Coutinho, present in the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] and a defender of the [[Jewish people|Jews]], Egas Moniz Teles, nobleman under king [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], whose family were amongst the first inhabitants of the [[Madeira]] island, judge Jo\u00e3o do Rego and his son in law Gast\u00e3o da Ilha, [[Squire]] to [[John, Constable of Portugal|Infante John]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Catedral de Silves / S\u00e9 de Silves|url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1293|website=Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Patrim\u00f3nio Cultural|publisher=Portuguese Government|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nEconomic difficulties and a diminishing population plagued the history of Silves in the 15th and 16th centuries, leading to the bishop staying for long periods away from Silves. The most notable of the bishops at this time was [[Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio]], one of the greatest Portuguese [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]]s and [[theologians]]. It was during his rule, in 1577, that the bishopric seat was transferred from Silves to [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], a more prosperous city located by the coast. In the next centuries the interior of the church was enriched with [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] [[altarpiece]]s, some of which still exist.\n\nThe [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great earthquake of 1755]] struck a terrible blow to Silves and its cathedral and destroyed part of the nave. The building was repaired and modified, replacing the simple Gothic forms of the upper part of the main fa\u00e7ade with [[Rococo]] [[volute]]s. The [[bell tower]] and the south portal are also 18th-century additions.\n\nIn the 20th century, an extensive renovation of Silves Cathedral suppressed many of the Baroque additions and returned the building to a more \"medieval\" look.\n\n==Art and architecture==\n[[Image:Se_Catedral_de_Silves_-_nave_central_2_03.2018.jpg|thumb|250px|right|View towards the main chapel.]]\nFrom the outside, a striking aspect of Silves Cathedral is the contrast between the [[whitewash]]ed surfaces of the walls and the red [[sandstone]] (''gr\u00e9s de Silves'') of the [[apse]], windows and main portal.\n\nThe main portal, executed in the 1470s, is inserted on a stepped rectangular moulding (''[[alfiz]]''), a common feature on the fa\u00e7ades of Portuguese mediaeval buildings since the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] era. Other primitive features of the portal are the figurative [[corbels]] of the upper [[cornice]] of the moulding, representing animal and human faces. The portal consists of a series of four columns and several pointed-arch [[archivolt]]s. \nThe outer archivolt is decorated with a series of reliefs of vegetal motifs and human figures, some playing musical instruments. The decoration of the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns reveals the influence of the [[Batalha Monastery|Batalha]] workshop, which was active in the 15th century. The portal of the main church of [[Portim\u00e3o]], located nearby, is almost a replica of the one in Silves and is believed to have been executed by the same artisans.<ref>[http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/74639/ Description of the Main Church of Portim\u00e3o at the IPPAR website.]</ref> The South portal is a Baroque addition (18th century).\n\nSilves Cathedral is a [[Latin cross]] church with a three-[[aisle]]d [[nave]], [[transept]] and three chapels in the east end. The east side of the church with transept was built earlier (mid-15th century) than the nave (probably early 16th century). The eastern chapels and transept are covered by Gothic stone [[rib vault]]ing, while the nave aisles are covered by a simple wooden roof. It is likely that the original plan called for the whole church to be covered by stone vaulting like other Portuguese cathedrals built at the time, like the [[Cathedral of Guarda]]. The aisles of the nave are separated by arches of pointed profile supported by columns of octagonal cross section. The south transept arm is illuminated by a large [[mullion]]ed window with Gothic [[tracery]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Igreja_de_Silves_vista_do_rio_Arade.JPG|Partial view of the Cathedral from the outside.\nFile:Se_Catedral_de_Silves_-_coro_03.2018.jpg|The Choir's ceiling.\nFile:28-08-2017_Tomb_of_Joao_Gramacho_and_his_wife_Ana_Taborda,_crusader,_S\u00e9_Catedral_de_Silves.JPG|The carved stone Sarcophagi Tomb of Crusader Jo\u00e3o Gramacho and his wife Ana Taborda.\nFile:Crusader_Tombs_(11952952856).jpg|The stones of Vincent Raposa Viegas on the left, King [[John II of Portugal|John II]] in the middle, and bishop Fernando Coutinho, on the right.\nFile:Se_Catedral_de_Silves_-_pedra_tumular_Egas_Moniz_Teles_03.2018.jpg|Tomb of [[Fidalgo|nobleman]] Egas Moniz Teles.\nFile:28-08-2017_South_Aisle_of_S\u00e9_Catedral_de_Silves.JPG|Details of the pillars and arches.\nFile:28-08-2017_Chapel_of_our_lord_of_stations,_S\u00e9_Catedral_de_Silves.JPG|Chapel of our lord of stations.\nFile:S\u00e9_de_Silves-Portal_principal.26-04-18.jpg|Main portal.\nFile:S\u00e9_de_Silves-Portal_lateral.26-04-18.jpg|Lateral portal.\nFile:S\u00e9_de_Silves-Abside.26-04-18.jpg|Lateral view of the Gothic apse.\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Silves Cathedral on the [[IGESPAR]] website [http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/69825/]\n*General Direction of National Monuments and Buildings (DGEMN-Portugal) [http://www.monumentos.pt]\n\n{{coord|37.1901|-8.4387|type:landmark_region:PT|display=title}}{{Commons-inline|S\u00e9 Catedral de Silves=}}\n\n{{R-C cathedrals in Portugal}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Churches in Faro District]]\n[[Category:Conversion of non-Christian religious buildings and structures into churches]]\n[[Category:Former mosques in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Gothic architecture in Portugal]]\n[[Category:National monuments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Silves, Portugal]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:S\u00e9_Catedral_de_Silves_-_Vista_exterior.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Gothic [[apse]] of Silves Cathedral.]]\nThe '''Silves Cathedral''' ({{lang-pt|S\u00e9 Catedral de Silves}}) is a former cathedral in the city of [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]], in the [[Algarve|Algarve region]] of southern [[Portugal]].

Among the school's notable founders includes that of [[Syracuse University]] Professor Dr. [[Bill Coplin]], S.U. Alumnus Donald Schupak and several members of The Friends of HSLAPS (Now called The Friends of Leadership & Public Service High School). Due to the school's close proximity to the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] (three blocks south) and [[Wall Street]], it was one of the four high schools in [[Lower Manhattan]] area to be displaced by the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Building===\n[[Image:Leadership and Public Service.jpg|thumb|right|90 Trinity Place is the grey building behind Trinity Church and In front of the corner of the South Tower of the World Trade Center]]\n\nThe building in which Leadership is currently located at, was a [[post-modern]] building, designed by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] in 1975. The building itself was the home of the [[New York University Stern School of Business]] from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. In order to make way for the newly formed High School for Leadership and Public Service, the Board of Education of the City of [[New York City|New York]], leased the building, 90 Trinity Place, from [[NYU]]. Until the renovations on the building were complete, Leadership was forced to share 3 floors next door with its neighbors, the [[High School of Economics and Finance]] (100 Trinity Place), during the 1993-94 school year.\n\n===School===\n\nHelen Cohen, the first principal (1993\u20131995), had a goal to prepared the students for college, and with the help of staff, most of the students in the first graduating classes got into college. Ada Rosario-Dolch, the second principal of the school (1995\u20132004), tried hard to make sure that the students passed the New York State Regents exams. Dolch worked hard to make the school effective, hiring more staff in the process.\n\nLeadership enjoyed a high school-to-college ratio, with the majority of the students eventually graduating from college.\n\n===September 11, 2001===\nNotable in Leadership's history is the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Leadership, a block south of the South Tower<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20091027053114/http://geocities.com/aolgillian/arial.jpg</ref>  along with its neighbor school (Economics and Finance) found it necessary to evacuate after the second plane hit. The engine of the second plane landed on Leadership's roof, and the school building itself was used as one of the morgue sites in the aftermath. The day of the attack, however, Principal Dolch was on the street welcoming voters to the school's polling booths and thus was on the street when the first plane hit. She suspected immediately that her sister, a [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] employee, very likely hadn't survived the first attack and focused on evacuating students and teachers safely.\n\nDolch, school secretary Lisa Quigley, AP Ted Bronsnick, and Dean of Students Neil Marks, smoothly and without external guidance, evacuated the 14-story building from the top down in minutes, out the south-east entrance and down to Battery Park.

Among the school's notable founders includes that of [[Syracuse University]] Professor Dr. [[Bill Coplin]], S.U. Alumnus Donald Schupak and several members of The Friends of HSLAPS (Now called The Friends of Leadership & Public Service High School). Due to the school's close proximity to the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] (three blocks south) and [[Wall Street]], it was one of the four high schools in [[Lower Manhattan]] area to be displaced by the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Building===\n[[Image:Leadership and Public Service.jpg|thumb|right|90 Trinity Place is the grey building behind Trinity Church and In front of the corner of the South Tower of the World Trade Center]]\n\nThe building in which Leadership is currently located at, was a [[post-modern]] building, designed by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] in 1975. The building itself was the home of the [[New York University Stern School of Business]] from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. In order to make way for the newly formed High School for Leadership and Public Service, the Board of Education of the City of [[New York City|New York]], leased the building, 90 Trinity Place, from [[NYU]]. Until the renovations on the building were complete, Leadership was forced to share 3 floors next door with its neighbors, the [[High School of Economics and Finance]] (100 Trinity Place), during the 1993-94 school year.\n\n===School===\n\nHelen Cohen, the first principal (1993\u20131995), had a goal to prepared the students for college, and with the help of staff, most of the students in the first graduating classes got into college. Ada Rosario-Dolch, the second principal of the school (1995\u20132004), tried hard to make sure that the students passed the New York State Regents exams. Dolch worked hard to make the school effective, hiring more staff in the process.\n\nLeadership enjoyed a high school-to-college ratio, with the majority of the students eventually graduating from college.\n\n===September 11, 2001===\nNotable in Leadership's history is the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Leadership, a block south of the South Tower<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20091027053114/http://geocities.com/aolgillian/arial.jpg</ref>  along with its neighbor school (Economics and Finance) found it necessary to evacuate after the second plane hit. The engine of the second plane landed on Leadership's roof, and the school building itself was used as one of the morgue sites in the aftermath. The day of the attack, however, Principal Dolch was on the street welcoming voters to the school's polling booths and thus was on the street when the first plane hit. She suspected immediately that her sister, a [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] employee, very likely hadn't survived the first attack and focused on evacuating students and teachers safely.\n\nDolch, school secretary Lisa Quigley, AP Ted Bronsnick, and Dean of Students Neil Marks, smoothly and without external guidance, evacuated the 14-story building from the top down in minutes, out the south-east entrance and down to Battery Park. Julia Martinez and Margaret Espinosa, who worked as special ed, one-on-one paras at the school risked their lives by carrying two teen-age students to safety after the girls' wheelchairs broke down from being pushed through the rubble.<ref>{{cite web|title=UFT fights for reinstatement of paraprofessionals|url=http://www.nysut.org/cps/rde/xchg/nysut/hs.xsl/newyorkteacher_030604nyt_23.htm|work=Article|publisher=NYSUT|accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> Randy Spotts, a dean, and John, a security officer at the school, stayed behind after the evacuation and assisted people outside who had been harmed by debris.

When it was divided it gave rise to the [[bay]] of S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto.\n\nIn historical times, the [[village]] was mentioned for the first time in a letter passed in 1257 by Friar Estev\u00e3o Martins, 12th abbot of the [[Monastery of Alcoba\u00e7a]]. The bay was the sea port of Alcoba\u00e7a, where activities related to [[fishing]] and [[shipbuilding]] were developed. It had, in 1801, 932 [[inhabitants]]. In 1839 the parishes of Alfeizer\u00e3o, Salir do Porto and Serra do Bouro were annexed. It had, in 1849, 3,596 inhabitants.\n\nGiven the local development and the construction of the [[pier]], already around 1885 the [[neighborhood]] of the [[beach]] came to remember a second village.\n\nIt was constituted has a [[Coast|seaside]] [[resort]] frequented by the [[nobility]] and the [[bourgeoisie]] since the end of the 19th century, becoming known as the \"bidet of the marquees\".<ref>{{cite web|URL = https://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/programas/perdidoseachados/2014-06-27-a-concha-do-oeste|title= ''The Western Shell''|date= 27 June 2014|accessdate= |author= |publisher= SIC Not\u00edcias}}</ref>\n\nCurrently the village is constituted by two distinct nuclei:\n* The lower part, near the beach, directed for the [[tourist]] activity;\n* The upper part, where the traditional [[dwellings]] and the [[Mother Church]] reside;\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe parish has one of the most beautiful beaches in the country, a bay, shaped like a [[scallop]], with calm waters and fine white [[sand]]. S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto was even considered the best beach to go with the family in the guide of 2015 beaches of [[eDreams]]. According to the [[online]] booking site for [[travel]] and [[hotels]], the \"natural bay of clear and calm water and surrounded by diverse shops and [[restaurants]] offers the ideal conditions for a relaxed family day\". In addition, the [[company]], based in [[Barcelona]], says that \"it is perfect for the baths of [[children]], while [[adults]] relax in the sand or have a drink on a terrace overlooking the [[sea]]\".<ref>{{cite web|URL = http://www.gazetacaldas.com/51619/sao-martinho-e-a-melhor-praia-para-ir-em-familia-segundo-a-edreams/|title= S\u00e3o Martinho is the \"best beach to go with family\" according to eDreams|date= 21 August 2015|accessdate= |author= |publisher= Gazeta das Caldas}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the commercial importance of the [[port]] has diminished, its tourist activity and the beach life give it a special dynamic, especially during the [[summer season]].\n\nThe bay is only connected to the sea by an opening of a few [[meters]]. Hence the waters are quiet, great for children and better still for competitions of [[sailing]], [[windsurf]] or [[kayak]]. The road by the sea, where parking is difficult, has numerous cafes, restaurants and terraces. A narrow pedestrian [[tunnel]] gives direct access to the [[ocean]] from the dock area.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, S\u00e3o Martinho attracted many curious people due to have been visited by a [[Pinniped|seal]], probably coming from [[France]], [[England]] or [[Iceland]]. The animal became known as \"Martinha\" and was, in that summer, the \"[[mascot]]\" of the village.<ref>{{cite web|URL = http://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/foca-do-norte-da-europa-e-atraccao-em-s-martinho-do-porto-1665022|title= Northern Europe seal is an attraction in S.

When it was divided it gave rise to the [[bay]] of S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto.\n\nIn historical times, the [[village]] was mentioned for the first time in a letter passed in 1257 by Friar Estev\u00e3o Martins, 12th abbot of the [[Monastery of Alcoba\u00e7a]]. The bay was the sea port of Alcoba\u00e7a, where activities related to [[fishing]] and [[shipbuilding]] were developed. It had, in 1801, 932 [[inhabitants]]. In 1839 the parishes of Alfeizer\u00e3o, Salir do Porto and Serra do Bouro were annexed. It had, in 1849, 3,596 inhabitants.\n\nGiven the local development and the construction of the [[pier]], already around 1885 the [[neighborhood]] of the [[beach]] came to remember a second village.\n\nIt was constituted has a [[Coast|seaside]] [[resort]] frequented by the [[nobility]] and the [[bourgeoisie]] since the end of the 19th century, becoming known as the \"bidet of the marquees\".<ref>{{cite web|URL = https://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/programas/perdidoseachados/2014-06-27-a-concha-do-oeste|title= ''The Western Shell''|date= 27 June 2014|accessdate= |author= |publisher= SIC Not\u00edcias}}</ref>\n\nCurrently the village is constituted by two distinct nuclei:\n* The lower part, near the beach, directed for the [[tourist]] activity;\n* The upper part, where the traditional [[dwellings]] and the [[Mother Church]] reside;\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe parish has one of the most beautiful beaches in the country, a bay, shaped like a [[scallop]], with calm waters and fine white [[sand]]. S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto was even considered the best beach to go with the family in the guide of 2015 beaches of [[eDreams]]. According to the [[online]] booking site for [[travel]] and [[hotels]], the \"natural bay of clear and calm water and surrounded by diverse shops and [[restaurants]] offers the ideal conditions for a relaxed family day\". In addition, the [[company]], based in [[Barcelona]], says that \"it is perfect for the baths of [[children]], while [[adults]] relax in the sand or have a drink on a terrace overlooking the [[sea]]\".<ref>{{cite web|URL = http://www.gazetacaldas.com/51619/sao-martinho-e-a-melhor-praia-para-ir-em-familia-segundo-a-edreams/|title= S\u00e3o Martinho is the \"best beach to go with family\" according to eDreams|date= 21 August 2015|accessdate= |author= |publisher= Gazeta das Caldas}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the commercial importance of the [[port]] has diminished, its tourist activity and the beach life give it a special dynamic, especially during the [[summer season]].\n\nThe bay is only connected to the sea by an opening of a few [[meters]]. Hence the waters are quiet, great for children and better still for competitions of [[sailing]], [[windsurf]] or [[kayak]]. The road by the sea, where parking is difficult, has numerous cafes, restaurants and terraces. A narrow pedestrian [[tunnel]] gives direct access to the [[ocean]] from the dock area.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, S\u00e3o Martinho attracted many curious people due to have been visited by a [[Pinniped|seal]], probably coming from [[France]], [[England]] or [[Iceland]]. The animal became known as \"Martinha\" and was, in that summer, the \"[[mascot]]\" of the village.<ref>{{cite web|URL = http://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/foca-do-norte-da-europa-e-atraccao-em-s-martinho-do-porto-1665022|title= Northern Europe seal is an attraction in S.
