It was dissolved in 1914, but then re-constituted in 1918 as ''Sportvereinigung VfB Elversberg'', spending a season in the tier-one [[Kreisliga Saar]] in 1921\u201322. After World War II a number of local associations came together to form ''Sportgemeinde Elversberg''. The current club became independent of ''SG'' as ''SV Elversberg VfB 07'' in 1952. From 1951 to 1960 ''SV'' played in the [[Amateurliga Saarland]] (III), but then disappeared into tier IV and V football until 1980 when they re-emerged in the Amateur [[Fu\u00dfball-Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar|Oberliga S\u00fcdwest]] (III) for a span of seven seasons. After nearly another decade spent between the [[Verbandsliga Saarland]] (IV) and the Landesliga Saarland/Nordost (V) the club returned to tier III football in the [[Regionalliga West/S\u00fcdwest]].\n\nSince 1998, ''SV Elversberg'' has played in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) as a lower table side. For the 2008\u201309 season, the club belonged to the new [[Regionalliga West]] where it stayed until 2012 when it became part of the new [[Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest]]. In [[2012\u201313 Regionalliga|2012\u201313]] the club finished runners-up in the new league and qualified for the promotion play-off to the [[3. Liga]] where it overcame the reserve team of [[TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen]] to earn promotion to this league.\n\nSV Elversberg lasted for only one season in the 3. Liga, suffering relegation alongside fellow Saar side [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]] back to the Regionalliga. They finished runners-up in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest in [[2015\u201316 Regionalliga#Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest|2015\u201316]] but lost to [[FSV Zwickau]] in the promotion play-off and had to remain in the league.

It was dissolved in 1914, but then re-constituted in 1918 as ''Sportvereinigung VfB Elversberg'', spending a season in the tier-one [[Kreisliga Saar]] in 1921\u201322. After World War II a number of local associations came together to form ''Sportgemeinde Elversberg''. The current club became independent of ''SG'' as ''SV Elversberg VfB 07'' in 1952. From 1951 to 1960 ''SV'' played in the [[Amateurliga Saarland]] (III), but then disappeared into tier IV and V football until 1980 when they re-emerged in the Amateur [[Fu\u00dfball-Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar|Oberliga S\u00fcdwest]] (III) for a span of seven seasons. After nearly another decade spent between the [[Verbandsliga Saarland]] (IV) and the Landesliga Saarland/Nordost (V) the club returned to tier III football in the [[Regionalliga West/S\u00fcdwest]].\n\nSince 1998, ''SV Elversberg'' has played in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) as a lower table side. For the 2008\u201309 season, the club belonged to the new [[Regionalliga West]] where it stayed until 2012 when it became part of the new [[Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest]]. In [[2012\u201313 Regionalliga|2012\u201313]] the club finished runners-up in the new league and qualified for the promotion play-off to the [[3. Liga]] where it overcame the reserve team of [[TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen]] to earn promotion to this league.\n\nSV Elversberg lasted for only one season in the 3. Liga, suffering relegation alongside fellow Saar side [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]] back to the Regionalliga. They finished runners-up in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest in [[2015\u201316 Regionalliga#Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest|2015\u201316]] but lost to [[FSV Zwickau]] in the promotion play-off and had to remain in the league.

The word breaks down into ''tricho'' \u2013 \"hair\", ''[[thio-|thio]]'' \u2013 \"sulphur\", and ''dystrophy'' \u2013 \"wasting away\" or literally \"bad nourishment\". TTD is associated with a range of symptoms connected with organs of the [[ectoderm]] and [[neuroectoderm]]. TTD may be subclassified into four syndromes: Approximately half of all patients with trichothiodystrophy have [[photosensitivity]], which divides the classification into syndromes with or without photosensitivity; BIDS and PBIDS, and IBIDS and PIBIDS. Modern covering usage is TTD-P (photosensitive), and TTD.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20687499 | volume=685 | title=Trichothiodystrophy: Photosensitive, TTD-P, TTD, Tay syndrome | year=2010 | author=Lambert WC, Gagna CE, Lambert MW | journal=Adv Exp Med Biol | pages=106\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\nFeatures of TTD can include photosensitivity, icthyosis, brittle hair and nails, intellectual impairment, decreased fertility and short stature.

The quotation may be from the same composer's work (self-referential), or from a different composer's work (appropriation). \n\nSometimes the quotation is done for the purposes of characterization, as in Puccini's use of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' in reference to the American character Lieutenant Pinkerton in his opera ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', or in Tchaikovsky's use of the Russian and French national anthems in the ''[[1812 Overture]]'', which depicted a battle between the Russian and French armies. \n\nSometimes, there is no explicit characterization involved, as in [[Luciano Berio]] using brief quotes from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Anton Webern]], and others in his ''[[Sinfonia (Berio)|Sinfonia]]''.\n\n==Quotation vs. variation==\nMusical quotation is to be distinguished from [[Variation (music)|variation]], where a composer takes a theme (their own or another's) and writes variations on it.  In that case, the origin of the theme is usually acknowledged in the title (e.g., [[Johannes Brahms]]'s ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'').  \n\nIn the case of quotations, however, an explicit acknowledgment does not generally appear in the score. Some exceptions are found in [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'': \n* in the section \"Florestan\" he quotes a theme from his earlier work ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2, and the inscription \"(Papillon?)\" is written underneath the notes (he quotes the same theme in the final section \"Marche des Davidsb\u00fcndler contre les Philistins\", but without acknowledgement)\n* in the final section, he also quotes another theme first used in ''Papillons'', the traditional ''[[Grossvater Tanz]]'' (Grandfather Dance), but this time the inscription is \"Th\u00e8me du XVII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle\".\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of musical quotations in classical music include:\n* [[Arnold Bax]] quoted a theme from [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' in his 1919 [[symphonic poem]] ''[[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]]''<ref name=baxworks>[http://www.davidparlett.co.uk/bax/bax4053.html  Baxworks]</ref>\n[[File:Bach es ist genug (DYK).png|thumb|Beginning of [[Es ist genug|Bach's quoted chorale setting]]]]\n* [[Alban Berg]] quoted [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s setting of the chorale \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), the closing chorale of Bach's cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]], with variations in the final movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]], subtitled \"To the memory of an Angel\" in memory of [[Manon Gropius]] who died at age 17. In the fourth movement of his ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' for string quartet, Berg quoted a phrase from the third movement of [[Alexander Zemlinsky]]'s ''[[Lyric Symphony (Zemlinsky)|Lyric Symphony]]'' that originally set the words \"Du bist mein eigen, mein eigen\" (Thou art mine own, mine own).\n* [[Georges Bizet]] used a song \"El Arreglito\" by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Iradier]] as the basis for the \"[[Habanera (aria)|Habanera]]\" (''L'amour est un oiseau rebelle'') in his opera ''[[Carmen]]'', believing it to be an anonymous folk song.

Some exceptions are found in [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'': \n* in the section \"Florestan\" he quotes a theme from his earlier work ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2, and the inscription \"(Papillon?)\" is written underneath the notes (he quotes the same theme in the final section \"Marche des Davidsb\u00fcndler contre les Philistins\", but without acknowledgement)\n* in the final section, he also quotes another theme first used in ''Papillons'', the traditional ''[[Grossvater Tanz]]'' (Grandfather Dance), but this time the inscription is \"Th\u00e8me du XVII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle\".\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of musical quotations in classical music include:\n* [[Arnold Bax]] quoted a theme from [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' in his 1919 [[symphonic poem]] ''[[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]]''<ref name=baxworks>[http://www.davidparlett.co.uk/bax/bax4053.html  Baxworks]</ref>\n[[File:Bach es ist genug (DYK).png|thumb|Beginning of [[Es ist genug|Bach's quoted chorale setting]]]]\n* [[Alban Berg]] quoted [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s setting of the chorale \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), the closing chorale of Bach's cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]], with variations in the final movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]], subtitled \"To the memory of an Angel\" in memory of [[Manon Gropius]] who died at age 17. In the fourth movement of his ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' for string quartet, Berg quoted a phrase from the third movement of [[Alexander Zemlinsky]]'s ''[[Lyric Symphony (Zemlinsky)|Lyric Symphony]]'' that originally set the words \"Du bist mein eigen, mein eigen\" (Thou art mine own, mine own).\n* [[Georges Bizet]] used a song \"El Arreglito\" by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Iradier]] as the basis for the \"[[Habanera (aria)|Habanera]]\" (''L'amour est un oiseau rebelle'') in his opera ''[[Carmen]]'', believing it to be an anonymous folk song.

He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness. \n\nIn his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \"[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]].\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>Crisp, Roger. \u201cHedonism Reconsidered.\u201d ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', vol. 73, no. 3, 2006, pp. 619\u2013645.

Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \u201cUtility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman.\u201d ''Philosophy East and West'', vol. 66, no. 2, 2016, pp. 650\u2013652., www.jstor.org/stable/43830917.

Given that this state is the most positive state for a human to be in, it is often simplified to mean happiness.

For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \u201chow should I ''be''\u201d rather than \u201cwhat should I ''do''.\u201d A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy.

He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness. \n\nIn his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \"[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]].\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>Crisp, Roger. \u201cHedonism Reconsidered.\u201d ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', vol. 73, no. 3, 2006, pp. 619\u2013645.

Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \u201cUtility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman.\u201d ''Philosophy East and West'', vol. 66, no. 2, 2016, pp. 650\u2013652., www.jstor.org/stable/43830917.

Members of the MHP dissidents formed a new party, the new formed of the moderate conservative nationalist [[\u0130yi Party]].\n\nSince the new party formed, both AKP and MHP fear to lose votes to a new nationalist party formed by former MHP members, which oppose the MHP decided to vote for support President Erdo\u011fan's constitutional amendment. As a result, the two parties agree to form a coalition.\n\n===Formation===\nThe alliance has a joint presidential candidate, incumbent President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]. Each party is expected to nominate candidates for parliament separately.\n\nOn 23 October 2018, after a series of public disagreements between the AKP and MHP, the MHP leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli formally announced that his party would no longer seek to field joint candidates in prominent areas in the forthcoming [[2019 Turkish local elections|March 2019 local elections]]. In response, Erdo\u011fan stressed that the two parties were fundamentally different, and must go their separate ways on issues they disagreed on.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nPublic disagreements focussed on a general pardon for pro-MHP prisoners, as well as a court decision to annul the abolition of the [[Student Oath (Turkey)|Student Oath]]. The oath had been abolished during the [[Solution process]] by the AKP government in an attempt to appease [[Kurdistan Worker's Party]] (PKK) rebels, who regard its recital as racist. The court's decision to re-establish it was strongly supported by the MHP, while opposed by the AKP.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nHowever, both parties have stressed that they do not regard this as a dissolution of the alliance in the Turkish parliament and that the suspension of the electoral alliance for the local elections is only temporary.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/will-erdogan-s-power-be-shaken-after-losing-his-biggest-ally-turkey-394900389 |title = Turkey: Will Erdogan's power take hit after losing his biggest political ally?}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Founding members===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Name\n!

Members of the MHP dissidents formed a new party, the new formed of the moderate conservative nationalist [[\u0130yi Party]].\n\nSince the new party formed, both AKP and MHP fear to lose votes to a new nationalist party formed by former MHP members, which oppose the MHP decided to vote for support President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]'s constitutional amendment. As a result, the two parties agree to form a coalition.\n\n===Formation===\nThe alliance has a joint presidential candidate, incumbent President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]. Each party is expected to nominate candidates for parliament separately.\n\nOn 23 October 2018, after a series of public disagreements between the AKP and MHP, the MHP leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli formally announced that his party would no longer seek to field joint candidates in prominent areas in the forthcoming [[2019 Turkish local elections|March 2019 local elections]]. In response, Erdo\u011fan stressed that the two parties were fundamentally different, and must go their separate ways on issues they disagreed on.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nPublic disagreements focussed on a general pardon for pro-MHP prisoners, as well as a court decision to annul the abolition of the [[Student Oath (Turkey)|Student Oath]]. The oath had been abolished during the [[Solution process]] by the AKP government in an attempt to appease [[Kurdistan Worker's Party]] (PKK) rebels, who regard its recital as racist. The court's decision to re-establish it was strongly supported by the MHP, while opposed by the AKP.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nHowever, both parties have stressed that they do not regard this as a dissolution of the alliance in the Turkish parliament and that the suspension of the electoral alliance for the local elections is only temporary.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/will-erdogan-s-power-be-shaken-after-losing-his-biggest-ally-turkey-394900389 |title = Turkey: Will Erdogan's power take hit after losing his biggest political ally?}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Founding members===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Name\n!

Such a 3D exposure of a whole cell with a typical object size of 20&nbsp;\u00b5m \u00d7 20&nbsp;\u00b5m require only 2 minutes.  Wide field exposures signify that the entire object is illuminated and detected simultaneously.\n\n==Spatially modulated illumination==\n[[File:Opthalmology AMD Super Resolution Cremer.png|thumb|200px|left|SMI + [[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|TIRF]] of human eye tissue affected by [[macular degeneration]]]]\n\nSMI microscopy is a light optical process of the so-called [[point spread function]]-engineering. These are processes which modify the point spread function (PSF) of a [[microscope]] in a suitable manner to either increase the optical resolution, to maximize the precision of [[distance]] measurements of fluorescent objects that are small relative to the [[wavelength]] of the illuminating light, or to extract other structural parameters in the nanometer range.\n\nThe SMI microscope being developed at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at Heidelberg University achieves this in the following manner: The illumination intensity within the object range is not uniform, unlike conventional wide field fluorescence microscopes, but is spatially modulated in a precise manner by the use of two opposing interfering laser beams along the axis.  The principle of the spatially modulated wave field was developed in 1993 by Bailey et al.  The SMI microscopy approach used in the Heidelberg application moves the object in high-precision steps through the wave field, or the wave field itself is moved relative to the object by phase shift.  This results in an improved axial size and distance resolution.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heintzmann R., Cremer C. | year = 1999 | title = Lateral modulated excitation microscopy: ''Improvement of resolution by using a diffraction grating'' | doi = 10.1117/12.336833 | journal = Proc.

However, this approach does not work when there are too many sources close to each other: The sources all blur together.\n\nSPDM (spectral precision distance microscopy) is a family of techniques in [[fluorescence microscopy]] which gets around this problem by measuring just a few sources at a time, so that each source is \"optically isolated\" from the others (i.e., separated by more than the microscope's resolution, typically ~200-250&nbsp;nm).<ref name=Lemmer2008/><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0009-2614(98)00673-3 |volume = 292 |issue = 1\u20132 |pages = 183\u2013187 |authors = A.M. van Oijen, J K\u00f6hler, J Schmidt, M M\u00fcller, G.

By combining many thousands of images of the same cell, it was possible using laser optical precision measurements to record localization images with significantly improved optical resolution.  The application of these novel nanoscopy processes appeared until recently very difficult because it was assumed that only specially manufactured molecules could be switched on and off in a suitable manner by using light.\n\nIn March 2008 [[Christoph Cremer]]\u2019s lab discovered that this was also possible for many standard fluorescent dye like [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], Alexa dyes and fluorescein molecules, provided certain photo-physical conditions are present.

At present, SPDM achieves 16 frames/sec with an effective resolution of 10&nbsp;nm in 2D (object plane); approximately 2000 such frames are combined with SMI data (ca. 10 sec acquisition time) to achieve a three-dimensional image of highest resolution (effective optical 3D resolution ca. 40-50&nbsp;nm).

They could be especially helpful in the identification and valuation of targets. For example, biomolecular machines (BMM) are highly complex nanostructures consisting of several large molecules and which are responsible for basic functions in the body cells. Depending on their functional status, they have a defined 3D structure. Examples of biomolecular machines are nucleosomes which enable the DNA, a two meter long carrier of genetic information, to fold in the body cells in a space of a few millionth of a millimeter in diameter only. Therefore, the DNA can serve as an information and control center.\n\nBy using LIMON 3D in combination with LIMON complex labeling, it is possible for the first time to make hidden proteins or nucleic acids of a 3D-molecule complex of the so-called biomolecular machines visible without destroying the complex. Up to now, the problem in most cases was that the complex had to be destroyed for detailed analysis of the individual macromolecules therein. Alternatively, virtual computer simulation models or expensive nuclear magnetic resonance methods were used to visualize the three-dimensional structure of such complexes.<ref>[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news457531 Super Resolution Microscopy for Pharmaceutical Industry: Patents granted for 3D complex labeling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109065512/http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news457531 |date=9 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.tlb.de/uploads/media/GFP_Superresolution_01.pdf GFP Superresolution]\n* [http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/AG_Cremer/pubnanoscopy.html Publication list optical nanoscopy]\n* [http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news09/press090112nano-e.html press release of the University of Heidelberg]\n* [http://www.optical-nanoscopy.com/ Superresolution Measurements Laser Optical Nanoscopy]\n\n{{Optical microscopy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vertico Smi}}\n[[Category:Microscopes]]\n[[Category:Fluorescence]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n[[File:3D Dual Color Super Resolution Microscopy Cremer 2010.png|thumb|600px|3D dual colour super resolution microscopy with Her2 and Her3 in breast cancer cells, standard dyes: Alexa 488, Alexa 568 - LIMON (SPDM +SMI]]\n'''Vertico spatially modulated illumination''' ('''Vertico-SMI''') is the fastest{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[light microscope]] for the 3D analysis of complete cells in the [[nanometer]] range.

Such a 3D exposure of a whole cell with a typical object size of 20&nbsp;\u00b5m \u00d7 20&nbsp;\u00b5m require only 2 minutes.

These are processes which modify the point spread function (PSF) of a [[microscope]] in a suitable manner to either increase the optical resolution, to maximize the precision of [[distance]] measurements of fluorescent objects that are small relative to the [[wavelength]] of the illuminating light, or to extract other structural parameters in the nanometer range.\n\nThe SMI microscope being developed at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at Heidelberg University achieves this in the following manner: The illumination intensity within the object range is not uniform, unlike conventional wide field fluorescence microscopes, but is spatially modulated in a precise manner by the use of two opposing interfering laser beams along the axis.  The principle of the spatially modulated wave field was developed in 1993 by Bailey et al.  The SMI microscopy approach used in the Heidelberg application moves the object in high-precision steps through the wave field, or the wave field itself is moved relative to the object by phase shift.  This results in an improved axial size and distance resolution.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heintzmann R., Cremer C. | year = 1999 | title = Lateral modulated excitation microscopy: ''Improvement of resolution by using a diffraction grating'' | doi = 10.1117/12.336833 | journal = Proc.

The pool is synthesized through [[Oligonucleotide synthesis#Synthesis by the phosphoramidite method|solid phase synthesis]] such that each strand has two constant regions ([[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] binding sites for PCR amplification) flanking a random region of a certain length, typically 25\u201350 bases long. Thus the total number of unique strands, called the sequence space, is 4<sup>N</sup> where ''N'' denotes the number of bases in the random region. Because 4<sup>25</sup> \u2248 10<sup>15</sup>, there is no practical reason to choose random regions of less than 25 bases in length, while going above this number of bases means that the total sequence space cannot be surveyed. However, since there are likely many potential candidates for a given catalytic reaction within the sequence space, random regions of 50 and even higher have successfully yielded catalytic deoxyribozymes.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" />\n\nThe pool is first subjected to a selection step, during which the catalytic strands are separated from the non-catalytic strands. The exact separation method will depend on the reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes [[affinity chromatography]], in which a [[Protein tag|biological tag]] attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a [[biotin]] tag with a [[streptavidin]] affinity column.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|Gel electrophoresis]] based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4\u201310 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity,<ref name=\"Silverman_2005\" /> though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions. After a sufficient number of rounds, the final pool is sequenced and the individual strands are tested for their catalytic activity.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The dynamics of the pool can be described through mathematical modeling\n<ref name=\"Spill_2016\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Spill F, Weinstein ZB, Irani Shemirani A, Ho N, Desai D, Zaman MH | title = Controlling uncertainty in aptamer selection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 43 | pages = 12076\u201312081 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27790993 | pmc = 5087011 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1605086113 }}\n</ref>\n, which shows how oligonucleotides undergo competitive binding with the targets and how the evolutionary outcome can be improved through fine tuning of parameters.\n\nDeoxyribozymes obtained through ''in vitro'' selection will be optimized for the conditions during the selection, such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] concentration, [[pH]], and the presence of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. Because of this, catalytic activity only in the presence of specific cofactors or other conditions can be achieved using positive selection steps, as well as negative selection steps against other undesired conditions.\n\n===''in vitro'' evolution===\nA similar method of obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through ''in vitro'' evolution. Though this term is often used interchangeably with ''in vitro'' selection, ''in vitro'' evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through [[genetic recombination]] or through [[point mutation]]s.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using [[error-prone PCR]] to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with ''in vitro'' selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.\n\nThe initial pool for ''in vitro'' evolution can be derived from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an ''in vitro'' selection experiment, which is sometimes also called ''in vitro'' reselection.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through ''in vitro'' evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA transcript]] of [[bovine serum albumin]] was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through [[deep sequencing]] analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.<ref name=\"Gysbers\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gysbers R, Tram K, Gu J, Li Y | title = Evolution of an Enzyme from a Noncatalytic Nucleic Acid Sequence | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 11405 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26091540 | pmc = 4473686 | doi = 10.1038/srep11405 }}</ref>\nThis first successful evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could provide support for the [[RNA World]] hypothesis.

The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which had no effect on activity, and had a [[Specificity constant|catalytic efficiency]] of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.<ref name=\"Ribozyme_to_Deoxyribozyme\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul N, Springsteen G, Joyce GF | title = Conversion of a ribozyme to a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 329\u201338 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16638538 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.01.007 }}</ref>\nThis first evidence for transfer of function between different nucleic acids could provide support for various [[RNA world#Alternative hypotheses|pre-RNA World]] hypotheses.\n\n==\"True\" catalysis?==\nBecause most deoxyribozymes suffer from [[product inhibition]] and thus exhibit single-[[Turnover number|turnover]] behavior, it is sometimes argued that deoxyribozymes do not exhibit \"true\" catalytic behavior since they cannot undergo multiple-turnover catalysis like most biological [[enzyme]]s. However, the general definition of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] requires only that the substance speeds up the [[Chemical kinetics|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] without being consumed by the reaction (i.e. it is not permanently chemically altered and can be recycled). Thus, by this definition, single-turnover deoxyribozymes are indeed catalysts.<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> Furthermore, many [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] [[enzyme]]s (both [[protein]]s and [[ribozyme]]s) also exhibit single-turnover behavior,<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> and so the exclusion of deoxyribozymes from the rank of \"catalyst\" simply because it does not feature multiple-turnover behavior seems unjustified.\n\n==Applications==\nAlthough RNA enzymes were discovered before DNA enzymes, the latter have some distinct advantages.

Thus the total number of unique strands, called the sequence space, is 4<sup>N</sup> where ''N'' denotes the number of bases in the random region. Because 4<sup>25</sup> \u2248 10<sup>15</sup>, there is no practical reason to choose random regions of less than 25 bases in length, while going above this number of bases means that the total sequence space cannot be surveyed.

The exact separation method will depend on the reaction being catalyzed. As an example, the separation step for ribonucleotide cleavage often utilizes [[affinity chromatography]], in which a [[Protein tag|biological tag]] attached to each DNA strand is removed from any catalytically active strands via cleavage of a ribonucleotide base. This allows the catalytic strands to be separated by a column that specifically binds the tag, since the non-active strands will remain bound to the column while the active strands (which no longer possess the tag) flow through. A common set-up for this is a [[biotin]] tag with a [[streptavidin]] affinity column.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> [[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|Gel electrophoresis]] based separation can also be used in which the change in molecular weight of strands upon the cleavage reaction is enough to cause a shift in the location of the reactive strands on the gel.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> After the selection step, the reactive pool is amplified via [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to regenerate and amplify the reactive strands, and the process is repeated until a pool of sufficient reactivity is obtained. Multiple rounds of selection are required because some non-catalytic strands will inevitably make it through any single selection step. Usually 4\u201310 rounds are required for unambiguous catalytic activity,<ref name=\"Silverman_2005\" /> though more rounds are often necessary for more stringent catalytic conditions.

Though this term is often used interchangeably with ''in vitro'' selection, ''in vitro'' evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through [[genetic recombination]] or through [[point mutation]]s.<ref name=\"Joyce_2004\" /><ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using [[error-prone PCR]] to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with ''in vitro'' selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.\n\nThe initial pool for ''in vitro'' evolution can be derived from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an ''in vitro'' selection experiment, which is sometimes also called ''in vitro'' reselection.<ref name=\"Silverman_2008\" /> The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through ''in vitro'' evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA transcript]] of [[bovine serum albumin]] was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through [[deep sequencing]] analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.<ref name=\"Gysbers\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gysbers R, Tram K, Gu J, Li Y | title = Evolution of an Enzyme from a Noncatalytic Nucleic Acid Sequence | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 11405 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26091540 | pmc = 4473686 | doi = 10.1038/srep11405 }}</ref>\nThis first successful evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could provide support for the [[RNA World]] hypothesis. In another recent study, an RNA ligase ribozyme was converted into a deoxyribozyme through ''in vitro'' evolution of the inactive deoxyribo-analog of the ribozyme. The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which had no effect on activity, and had a [[Specificity constant|catalytic efficiency]] of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.<ref name=\"Ribozyme_to_Deoxyribozyme\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul N, Springsteen G, Joyce GF | title = Conversion of a ribozyme to a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 329\u201338 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16638538 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.01.007 }}</ref>\nThis first evidence for transfer of function between different nucleic acids could provide support for various [[RNA world#Alternative hypotheses|pre-RNA World]] hypotheses.\n\n==\"True\" catalysis?==\nBecause most deoxyribozymes suffer from [[product inhibition]] and thus exhibit single-[[Turnover number|turnover]] behavior, it is sometimes argued that deoxyribozymes do not exhibit \"true\" catalytic behavior since they cannot undergo multiple-turnover catalysis like most biological [[enzyme]]s. However, the general definition of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] requires only that the substance speeds up the [[Chemical kinetics|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] without being consumed by the reaction (i.e. it is not permanently chemically altered and can be recycled). Thus, by this definition, single-turnover deoxyribozymes are indeed catalysts.<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> Furthermore, many [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] [[enzyme]]s (both [[protein]]s and [[ribozyme]]s) also exhibit single-turnover behavior,<ref name=\"Silverman_2004\" /> and so the exclusion of deoxyribozymes from the rank of \"catalyst\" simply because it does not feature multiple-turnover behavior seems unjustified.\n\n==Applications==\nAlthough RNA enzymes were discovered before DNA enzymes, the latter have some distinct advantages. DNA is more [[cost-effective]], and DNA can be made with longer sequence length and can be made with higher purity in [[solid-phase synthesis]].<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Kumar B, Asha K, Chauhan SP |date=2013-10-07|title=DNAzyme Mediated Post-transcriptional Gene Silencing: A Novel Therapeutic Approach|url=https://www.webmedcentral.com/article_view/4415}}</ref> Several studies have shown the usage of DNAzymes to inhibit influenza A and B virus replication in host cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar B, Khanna M, Kumar P, Sood V, Vyas R, Banerjea AC | title = Nucleic acid-mediated cleavage of M1 gene of influenza A virus is significantly augmented by antisense molecules targeted to hybridize close to the cleavage site | journal = Molecular Biotechnology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 27\u201336 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21744034 | doi = 10.1007/s12033-011-9437-z }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar B, Rajput R, Pati DR, Khanna M | title = Potent Intracellular Knock-Down of Influenza A Virus M2 Gene Transcript by DNAzymes Considerably Reduces Viral Replication in Host Cells | journal = Molecular Biotechnology | volume = 57 | issue = 9 | pages = 836\u201345 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26021603 | doi = 10.1007/s12033-015-9876-z }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar B, Kumar P, Rajput R, Saxena L, Daga MK, Khanna M | title = Sequence-specific cleavage of BM2 gene transcript of influenza B virus by 10-23 catalytic motif containing DNA enzymes significantly inhibits viral RNA translation and replication | journal = Nucleic Acid Therapeutics | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 355\u201362 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23971908 | doi = 10.1089/nat.2013.0432 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Z, Zhang S, Wang S | title = DNAzymes Dz13 target the c-jun possess antiviral activity against influenza A viruses | journal = Microbial Pathogenesis | volume = 103 | pages = 155\u2013161 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28039102 | doi = 10.1016/j.micpath.2016.12.024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar B, Asha K, Khanna M, Ronsard L, Meseko CA, Sanicas M | title = The emerging influenza virus threat: status and new prospects for its therapy and control | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 163 | issue = 4 | pages = 831\u2013844 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29322273 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-018-3708-y }}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Asha K, Kumar P, Sanicas M, Meseko CA, Khanna M, Kumar B | title = Advancements in Nucleic Acid Based Therapeutics against Respiratory Viral Infections | journal = Journal of Clinical Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30577479 | pmc = 6351902 | doi = 10.3390/jcm8010006 }}</ref> DNAzymes have also been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV),<ref name=\":0\" /> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),<ref name=\":0\" /> human rhinovirus 14<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schubert S, G\u00fcl DC, Grunert HP, Zeichhardt H, Erdmann VA, Kurreck J | title = RNA cleaving '10-23' DNAzymes with enhanced stability and activity | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 20 | pages = 5982\u201392 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14530446 | pmc = 219472 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg791 }}</ref> and HCV<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy S, Gupta N, Subramanian N, Mondal T, Banerjea AC, Das S | title = Sequence-specific cleavage of hepatitis C virus RNA by DNAzymes: inhibition of viral RNA translation and replication | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 89 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1579\u201386 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18559927 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.83650-0 | url = http://repository.ias.ac.in/8644/1/340.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Drug clinical trials===\nAsthma is characterized by eosinophil-induced inflammation motivated by a type 2 helper T cell (Th2).

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
