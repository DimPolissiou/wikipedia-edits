Component stylesheets can be included via Sass or by customizing the initial Foundation download. Developers can adapt the Foundation file itself, selecting the components they wish to use in their project.\n\nAdjustments are possible through a central configuration stylesheet. More profound changes are possible by changing the Sass variables.\n\nThe use of Sass stylesheet language allows the use of variables, functions and operators, nested selectors, as well as so-called mixins.\n\nSince version 3.0, the configuration of Foundation also has a special \"Customize\" option in the documentation. Moreover, developers use on a form to choose the desired components and adjust, if necessary, the values of various options to their needs.

The toolkit is fully responsive to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape format, tablets and PCs with a low and high resolution (widescreen). This adjusts the width of the columns automatically.\n\n=== Understanding CSS stylesheet ===\n\nFoundation provides a set of stylesheets that provide basic style definitions for all key HTML components. These provide a browser and system-wide uniform, modern appearance for formatting text, tables and form elements.\n\n=== Re-usable components ===\n\nIn addition to the regular HTML elements, Foundation contains other commonly used interface elements. These include buttons with advanced features (for example, grouping of buttons or buttons with drop-down option, make and navigation lists, horizontal and vertical tabs, navigation, breadcrumb navigation, pagination, etc.), labels, advanced typographic capabilities, and formatting for messages such as warnings.\n\n=== JavaScript components and plug-ins ===\n\n[https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/javascript.html Official Zurb '''Foundation''' Main documentation page for JavaScript]\n\nThe JavaScript components of Foundation 4 were moved from [[jQuery]] Javascript library to Zepto, on a presumption that the physically smaller, but API-compatible alternative to JQuery would prove faster for the user.

The execution was the culmination of political and military conflicts between the [[cavaliers|royalists]] and the [[roundheads|parliamentarians]] in [[England]] during the [[English Civil War]], leading to the capture and trial of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. On Saturday 27 January 1649, the parliamentarian [[High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I|High Court of Justice]] had declared Charles guilty of attempting to \"uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people\" and he was sentenced to death.<ref name=constitution>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur082.htm |editor-first=Samuel Rawson |editor-last=Gardiner |title= The Charge against the King |work=The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution 1625-1660 |year=1906 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=2019-03-02}}</ref>\n\nCharles spent his last few days in [[St James's Palace]], accompanied by his most loyal subjects and visited by his children. On 30 January, he was taken to a large black [[gallows|scaffold]] constructed  in front of the Banqueting House, where he was to be executed. A large crowd had gathered to witness the [[regicide]]. Charles stepped onto the scaffold and gave his last speech - declaring his innocence of the crimes of which parliament had accused him, and claiming himself as a \"martyr of the people\". The crowd could not hear the speech, owing to the many parliamentarian guards blocking the scaffold, but Charles' companion, [[William Juxon]], recorded it in shorthand. Charles gave a few last words to Juxon, claiming his \"incorruptible crown\" in Heaven, and put his head on the block. He waited a few moments and gave a signal; the anonymous executioner beheaded Charles in one clean blow and held Charles' head up to the crowd silently, dropping it into the swarm of soldiers soon after.\n\nThe execution has been described as one of the most significant and controversial events in [[English history]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Kelsey|2002|p=727}}: \"The death of Charles I is an iconic moment in the history of western civilization.

The execution was the culmination of political and military conflicts between the [[cavaliers|royalists]] and the [[roundheads|parliamentarians]] in [[England]] during the [[English Civil War]], leading to the capture and trial of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. On Saturday 27 January 1649, the parliamentarian [[High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I|High Court of Justice]] had declared Charles guilty of attempting to \"uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people\" and he was sentenced to death.<ref name=constitution>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur082.htm |editor-first=Samuel Rawson |editor-last=Gardiner |title= The Charge against the King |work=The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution 1625-1660 |year=1906 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=2019-03-02}}</ref>\n\nCharles spent his last few days in [[St James's Palace]], accompanied by his most loyal subjects and visited by his children. On 30 January, he was taken to a large black [[gallows|scaffold]] constructed  in front of the Banqueting House, where he was to be executed. A large crowd had gathered to witness the [[regicide]]. Charles stepped onto the scaffold and gave his last speech - declaring his innocence of the crimes of which parliament had accused him, and claiming himself as a \"martyr of the people\". The crowd could not hear the speech, owing to the many parliamentarian guards blocking the scaffold, but Charles' companion, [[William Juxon]], recorded it in shorthand. Charles gave a few last words to Juxon, claiming his \"incorruptible crown\" in Heaven, and put his head on the block. He waited a few moments and gave a signal; the anonymous executioner beheaded Charles in one clean blow and held Charles' head up to the crowd silently, dropping it into the swarm of soldiers soon after.\n\nThe execution has been described as one of the most significant and controversial events in [[English history]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Kelsey|2002|p=727}}: \"The death of Charles I is an iconic moment in the history of western civilization.

Robert gets into all sorts of trouble in attempting to carry on the ruse, saving his friend's business but also attracting the attention of aviation-mad Grace Douglas (Patsy Ruth Miller). At first, he is able to carry out simple publicity events, but when he accidentally starts up an aircraft, his incredible aerobatics end with a landing in a haystack. When a race is staged between him and French ace Major Jules Gaillard ([[Armand Kaliz]]), it ends with Robert confessing he is no pilot, but still winning Grace's heart.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Armand Kaliz in The Aviator.jpg|thumb|Parisian-born Armand Kaliz as Major Jules Gaillard.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Robert Street\n* [[Patsy Ruth Miller]] as Grace Douglas\n* [[Johnny Arthur]] as Hobart\n* [[William Bailey (actor)|William Norton Bailey]] as Brooks\n* [[Armand Kaliz]] as Major Jules Gaillard\n* [[Edward Martindel]] as Gordon\n* [[Lee Moran]] as Brown\n* [[Kewpie Morgan]] as Sam Robinson\n* [[Phillips Smalley]] as John Douglas\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Aviator'' appeared at a time when aviation films were extremely popular, with only western films being made in larger numbers. It was typical to even have aircraft show up in a western. Blending comedy in ''The Aviator'' with aerial thrills seemed to be an ideal way to satisfy the public's appetite for aviation subjects.<ref>Wynne 1987, p. 85.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Aviator'' was well received as both a comedy and an aviation film. [[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]] wrote, \"The ensuing wild ride through the air is the best part of the picture, with Robert trying to maintain his equilibrium and dignity throughout.\"<ref>Erickson, Hal.

A [[foreign language version]] in French was made in 1931 and was entitled ''L'aviateur''. In 1938, eight years after ''Going Wild'', Warner Bros. remade this movie again as a musical titled ''[[Going Places (1938 film)|Going Places]]'', starring [[Dick Powell]] (impersonating a famous horseman), with [[Ronald Reagan]] appearing in an early role.\n\n==Preservation==\nNo film elements of ''The Aviator'' are known to survive. The soundtrack, which was recorded on [[Vitaphone]] disks, may survive in private hands.<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/A/Aviator1929-2.html \"The Aviator (1929).\"] ''SilentEra''.
