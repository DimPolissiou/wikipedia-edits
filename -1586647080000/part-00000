The population was 1,269 at the 2010 census, up from 1,247 at the 2000 census. It is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) east of [[Redding, California]].  The communities of [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]] (pop. 2,781), [[Millville, California|Millville]] (pop. 727), [[Shingletown, California|Shingletown]] (pop. 2,283), [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]] (pop. 880),{{sfn|Berkshire Hathaway Home Services}} [[Whitmore, California|Whitmore]] (pop. 999),{{sfn|CLR Choice, Inc.}} and [[Round Mountain, California|Round Mountain]] (pop. 155) lie within a 15-mile (24&nbsp;km) radius.\n\nOriginally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th Century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary, that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the [[Sacramento Valley]] by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (1829) and [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]] (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th Century.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 338.1 people per square mile (130.5/km<sup>2</sup>). Award winning country musician [[Merle Haggard]] lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples===\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n\nPrior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} These tribes included the [[Wintu]], [[Patwin]]s, Nozi, [[Pit River Tribe|Pit Rivers]], Hat Creeks, [[Shasta people|Shastas]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]s, and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Indian tribes.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] Indian tribes on the [[Pacific coast]] or valley included the [[Maidu]], [[Miwok]], [[Ohlone|Constanoan]], [[Yokuts]], Yanas, and other divisions. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} Historians said that, in the lower 48 continental United States, California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes and more different Indian languages.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{see|History of California before 1900|Alta California|California grizzly bears}}\nDuring the 18th Century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], in 1769\u20131770, that led to the founding of [[Alta California]], reaching as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe 19th Century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior. In March 1812, the Russian-American Fur Company under [[Ivan Kuskov]] established a colony at [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the coast of what is now Sonoma County.{{sfn|''Fort Ross'' Establishment of the California Settlement 1998}} As early as 1817, Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]], on an expedition sighted a snow capped mountain (Mount Shasta), that he called ''Jesus Maria'', from what is now the Marysville plains. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} Three years later, in 1827, an expedition to the Klammath Mountains from the Coastal Range, by explorer [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello|Luis Arg\u00fcello]] and company, sighted two \"twin\" mountains, believed to be Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} In 1826, Mount Shasta was seen by Hudson Bay fur trader Peter Skene Odgen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=14}} In 1828, Mt. Shasta was seen by United States fur trapper [[Jedediah Smith]], whom he named ''Mt. Simpson''.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=13-14}} On April 11, 1828 Smith and his party traveled north and entered what is now called Shasta County, and proceeded to what is now called [[Burnt Ranch, California|Burnt Ranch]] in Trinity County.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=13-14}}\n[[File:John Work, Hudson's Bay Company officer, before 1861.jpg|left|thumb|120px|<center>'''John Work'''</center>]]\nThe earliest [[European Americans|European American]] history of Palo Cedro comes from the exploration of [[Hudson's Bay Company]] trapper [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (c. 1782&nbsp;\u2013 11 June 1840) who sometime between March 26, 1829 and April 6, 1829, along with guide [[John Turner (fur trapper)|John Turner]], and a brigade of trappers, traveling through Mexican [[California]], started from the Pit River following the [[Cow Creek (Sacramento River tributary)|Cow Creek]] trail, and reached the Sacramento River.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} [[Cow Creek (Sacramento River tributary)|Cow Creek]] is Sacramento River tributary that runs through Palo Cedro and serves as its south eastern borderline. McLeod had been sent out earlier in January 1829 from Fort Vancouver to find the origins of a mythical [[Buenaventura River (legend)|Buenaventura River]].{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} After crossing the Sacramento River, McLeod explored and trapped in the [[Sacramento Valley]] as far South as present day Stockton. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} Upon his return with an abundant supply of furs, he camped on the west bank of the Sacramento River by present day [[Anderson, California|Anderson]] in December 1829. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} While attempting to cross the Cascades in winter, McLeod was met by a snow storm at the headwaters of the river named after him, ''McLeod River'' ([[McCloud River]]), he lost all his horses, was forced to cache his furs, and by snowshoe trek back to Vancouver, arriving on February 10, 1830. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}}{{efn|According to historian Rosena A. Giles, the name of the McCloud river was a misspelling of McLeod's original name, and confused by the name of Ross McCloud, a pioneer of the 1850's. In 1878, an unsuccessful attempt was made by C.C. Bush to have the California state legislature change the name of the river from ''McCloud'' to ''McLeod''.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} Frank & Chapel called the river ''McLeod''. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} Reading called the river ''McLoud''.  {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}}}}\n[[File:74-LASSOING_A_GRIZZLEY.jpg|right|180px|thumb|'''Lassoing a Grizzley''' ''1873''<br>Canadian fur trapper John Work, in 1832, noted there were California grizzlies, in the area of what is now Palo Cedro.

Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.\n\nAs Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975.  Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to the current location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. Palo Cedro Pharmacy has an eclectic mix of pictures, memorabilia, and antiques collected over the last 40 years showing how the town and pharmacy has changed over the years. The unannounced and unknown to the Community and self proclaimed current Mayor of Palo Cedro is Carlos Zapata.\n\n==Geography==\nPalo Cedro is located at {{Coord|40|33|4|N|122|14|3|W|type:city}} (40.551091, \u2212122.234255)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an elevation of 465&nbsp;ft (143 m) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, 98.00% of it land, and 2.00% of it water.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Palo Cedro has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=692740&cityname=Palo+Cedro%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Palo Cedro, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715032244/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Palo Cedro CDP|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Palo Cedro had a population of 1,269.

The population was 1,269 at the 2010 census, up from 1,247 at the 2000 census. It is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) east of [[Redding, California]].  The communities of [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]] (pop. 2,781), [[Millville, California|Millville]] (pop. 727), [[Shingletown, California|Shingletown]] (pop. 2,283), [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]] (pop. 880),{{sfn|Berkshire Hathaway Home Services}} [[Whitmore, California|Whitmore]] (pop. 999),{{sfn|CLR Choice, Inc.}} and [[Round Mountain, California|Round Mountain]] (pop. 155) lie within a 15-mile (24&nbsp;km) radius.\n\nOriginally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th Century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary, that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the [[Sacramento Valley]] by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (1829) and [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]] (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th Century.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 338.1 people per square mile (130.5/km<sup>2</sup>). Award winning country musician [[Merle Haggard]] lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples===\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n\nPrior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} These tribes included the [[Wintu]], [[Patwin]]s, Nozi, [[Pit River Tribe|Pit Rivers]], Hat Creeks, [[Shasta people|Shastas]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]s, and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Indian tribes.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] Indian tribes on the [[Pacific coast]] or valley included the [[Maidu]], [[Miwok]], [[Ohlone|Constanoan]], [[Yokuts]], Yanas, and other divisions. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} Historians said that, in the lower 48 continental United States, California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes and more different Indian languages.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{see|History of California before 1900|Alta California|California grizzly bears}}\nDuring the 18th Century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], in 1769\u20131770, that led to the founding of [[Alta California]], reaching as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe 19th Century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior. In March 1812, the Russian-American Fur Company under [[Ivan Kuskov]] established a colony at [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the coast of what is now Sonoma County.{{sfn|''Fort Ross'' Establishment of the California Settlement 1998}} As early as 1817, Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]], on an expedition sighted a snow capped mountain (Mount Shasta), that he called ''Jesus Maria'', from what is now the Marysville plains. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} Three years later, in 1827, an expedition to the Klammath Mountains from the Coastal Range, by explorer [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello|Luis Arg\u00fcello]] and company, sighted two \"twin\" mountains, believed to be Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} In 1826, Mount Shasta was seen by Hudson Bay fur trader Peter Skene Odgen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=14}} In 1828, Mt.

Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.\n\nAs Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975.  Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to the current location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. Palo Cedro Pharmacy has an eclectic mix of pictures, memorabilia, and antiques collected over the last 40 years showing how the town and pharmacy has changed over the years. The current Mayor of Palo Cedro is Carlos Zapata.\n\n==Geography==\nPalo Cedro is located at {{Coord|40|33|4|N|122|14|3|W|type:city}} (40.551091, \u2212122.234255)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an elevation of 465&nbsp;ft (143 m) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, 98.00% of it land, and 2.00% of it water.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Palo Cedro has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=692740&cityname=Palo+Cedro%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Palo Cedro, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715032244/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Palo Cedro CDP|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Palo Cedro had a population of 1,269.

The car has reported slipping sales in recent times, mainly due to the introduction of the Alto at a comparable price. The car produces approximately {{convert|37|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} of power and runs on 12&nbsp;inch wheels. Curb weight is {{convert|650|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and four passengers (including the driver) fit in. [[Maruti Suzuki]] had earlier launched a version with a twelve-valve version of the engine producing {{convert|45|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, coupled with a five-speed manual transmission (currently found in the [[Suzuki Alto]]) but discontinued it after a couple of years. The second generation Maruti 800 that was produced from 1986\u20131997 underwent some changes in its appearance. The original grille that was introduced in 1986 was a horizontal slat grille with 'Maruti 800' monograms at the right hand corner. This grille was replaced by a mesh grille with the Maruti Logo in the centre in 1997. Also, the bonnet opener that was placed on the bonnet was replaced by an ejection button inside of the car. The hubcaps were also changed from the shiny silver ones to plastic ones. Several new colours were also introduced, such as Bottle Green, Biscuit, Pearl White, Blue, etcetera.\n\n[[File:MHV Maruti Suzuki 800 02.jpg|left|thumb|Maruti Suzuki 800 in Europe.

An [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] version of the vehicle was also released in 2008. As of September 2009, the company has yet to reach a decision regarding the manufacture of a [[Euro IV]]-compliant version of the vehicle because it would increase the retail price.

The car has reported slipping sales in recent times, mainly due to the introduction of the Alto at a comparable price. The car produces approximately {{convert|37|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} of power and runs on 12&nbsp;inch wheels. Curb weight is {{convert|650|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and four passengers (including the driver) fit in. [[Maruti Suzuki]] had earlier launched a version with a twelve-valve version of the engine producing {{convert|45|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, coupled with a five-speed manual transmission (currently found in the [[Suzuki Alto]]) but discontinued it after a couple of years. The second generation Maruti 800 that was produced from 1986\u20131997 underwent some changes in its appearance. The original grille that was introduced in 1986 was a horizontal slat grille with 'Maruti 800' monograms at the right hand corner. This grille was replaced by a mesh grille with the Maruti Logo in the centre in 1997. Also, the bonnet opener that was placed on the bonnet was replaced by an ejection button inside of the car. The hubcaps were also changed from the shiny silver ones to plastic ones. Several new colours were also introduced, such as Bottle Green, Biscuit, Pearl White, Blue, etcetera.\n\n[[File:MHV Maruti Suzuki 800 02.jpg|left|thumb|Maruti Suzuki 800 in Europe.

An [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] version of the vehicle was also released in 2008. As of September 2009, the company has yet to reach a decision regarding the manufacture of a [[Euro IV]]-compliant version of the vehicle because it would increase the retail price. However even stricter emissions regulations which come into effect by April 2010, would mandate Euro IV compliance in major Indian cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore and 2015\u20132016 for the remainder of the country.
