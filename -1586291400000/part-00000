Compare with photo of Vesterport station in Copenhagen below. The concept is the same.]]\nThe '''S-train''' is a type of hybrid [[urban rail|urban]]-[[suburban rail]] serving a [[metropolitan region]]. Some of the larger S-train systems provide service similar to [[rapid transit]] systems, while smaller ones often resemble [[Commuter rail|commuter]] or even [[regional rail]]. They are especially common in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], where they are known as '''S-Bahn''', which in the 1930s was an abbreviation of either ''Schnellbahn'', ''Stadtbahn'' or ''Stadtschnellbahn'', depending on the city, but they must not be confused with ''U-Stadtbahnen''.<ref>See example of this for [[Stuttgart]] (\"Warum Stuttgart trotz U keine U-Bahn hat\" ; literal translation: \"Why does Stuttgart despite the U lack a U-Bahn (=Metro/Underground/Subway) [http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.stadtbahn-warum-stuttgart-trotz-u-keine-u-bahn-hat.6d3354e2-da68-4a5e-b84a-c6bc352ab87e.html]</ref>  Similar S-train systems exist also in [[Switzerland]] known as S-Bahn as well. In [[Denmark]], they are known as '''S-tog''' {{IPA-da|\u02c8es\u02ccts\u02b0\u0254\u02c0w|}}, in the [[Czech Republic]] as '''Esko''' or '''S-lines''', and northern [[Italy]] as '''Servizio ferroviario''' followed by either the word \"metropolitano\" (in [[Turin]]) or \"suburbano\" (in [[Milan]]).\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThere is no complete definition of an S-train system. S-trains are, where they exist, the most local type of railway stopping at all existing stations inside and around a city, while other mainline trains only call at major stations. They are slower than mainline railways but usually serve as fast crosstown services within the city.  S-trains generally service the hinterland of a certain city, rather than connecting different cities, although in high population density areas a few exceptions from this exist. A good example of a such exception is the [[Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn]], which interconnects the cities, towns and suburbs of the [[Ruhr]], a large [[urban agglomeration]], not unlike the large net of regional trains which also serve the area. Most S-train systems are entirely built on older local railways, or in some cases parallel to an existing dual track railway. Most use existing local mainline railway trackage, but a few branches and lines can be purpose built S-train lines.<ref>An example of this is the ''K\u00f8gebugt'' or K\u00f8ge-Bay railway at Copenhagen, built 1971 to 1983 {{cite web |url=http://www.bane.dk/visArtikel.asp?artikelID=256 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050203185250/http://bane.dk/visArtikel.asp?artikelID=256 |archive-date=3 February 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://s-bahn-galerie.de/S_Bahn_Hamburg/Geschichte_HH.htm S-train tunnel at Hamburg between Central Station and Altona 1967-1979]</ref> S-trains typically use overhead lines or a third rail for traction power. In Hamburg the S-trains use both the methods, depending on which line is powered.<ref>http://s-bahn-galerie.de/S_Bahn_Hamburg/Geschichte_HH.htm</ref>\n\nIn smaller S-train systems and suburban sections of larger ones, S-trains typically share tracks with other rail traffic, with the [[Berlin S-Bahn]], [[Hamburg S-Bahn]] and [[Copenhagen S-train]] being notable exceptions. Busy S-train corridors sometimes have sections of exclusive trackage of their own but parallel to mainline railways. Many of the larger S-train systems will also have central corridors of exclusive trackage that individual suburban branches feed into, creating high frequency corridors. In many cases, the central corridor is a dedicated underground line in the city center with close stop spacing and a high combined frequency similar to metro systems. A good example of this is the [[Berliner Stadtbahn]] in the Berlin's S-Bahn, which is regarded as a tourist attraction.<ref name=\"stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de\">http://www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de/strecken/01/</ref><ref>same</ref> However, in more lightly used sections outside the city center, S-trains commonly share tracks with other train types.\n\nFurther out from the central parts of a city the individual services branch off into lines where the distances between stations can exceed 5&nbsp;km, similar to commuter rail. This allows the S-train to serve a dual transportation purpose: local transport within a city center and suburban transport between central boroughs of larger cities, and to suburbs. Frequencies vary wildly between systems with short headways in the core sections of large networks to headways of over 20 minutes in remote sections of the network, late at night and/or on Sundays and in smaller systems. The rolling stock typically used in S-Trains reflect its hybrid purpose. The interior is designed for short journeys with provision for standing passengers but may have more space allocated to larger and more numerous seats. Integration with other local transport for ticketing, connectivity and easy interchange between lines or other system like metros is typical for S-trains. Where both S-train and metro exist, the number of interchange stations between the two systems is substantial with metro tickets being valid on S-trains, and vice versa. The [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] constitutes the main local railway system for [[Leipzig]] but also connects to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], where a few stations are located. The [[Rostock S-Bahn]] is an example of a smaller S-Bahn system.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n=== Germany, Austria and Switzerland ===\nThe name ''S-Bahn'' (S-train) is an abbreviation for the German \"Stadtschnellbahn\" (meaning \"city rapid railway\") and was introduced in December 1930 in Berlin. The name was introduced at the time of the reconstruction of the suburban commuter train tracks&mdash; the first section to be electrified was a section of the [[Berlin\u2013Szczecin railway]] from [[Berlin Nordbahnhof]] to [[Bernau bei Berlin station]] in 1924, leading to the formation of the Berlin S-Bahn.<ref>http://www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de (in German)</ref>  On 17 February 1934, a competition was held by Politiken newspaper, asking its readers to submit their suggestions for what the new electric  rail system the jury voted unanimously for \"S-Line\".<ref name=\"cph post\">{{cite web |title=How the S-train got its S \u2013 The Post |url=http://cphpost.dk/history/how-the-s-train-got-its-s.html |website=cphpost.dk |publisher=CPH Post |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe main line [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] (English: ''City railway of Berlin'') was electrified with a 750 volt [[third rail]] in 1928 (some steam trains ran until 1929) and the circle line [[Berlin Ringbahn]] was electrified in 1929. The electrification continued on the radial suburban railway tracks along with changing the timetable of the train system into a rapid transit model with no more than 20 minutes headway per line where a number of lines overlapped on the main line. The system peaked during the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin to a train schedule below 2 minutes.<ref>http://www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de (in German); chose \"Geschichte\" (History)</ref>\n\nThe idea of heavy rail rapid transit was not unique to Berlin. Hamburg had an electric railway between the central station (\"Hauptbahnhof\") and Altona which opened in 1906 and in 1934 the system adopted the S-Bahn label from Berlin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The same year in Denmark, Copenhagen's [[S-tog]] opened its first line. In Austria, Vienna had its ''Stadtbahn'' main line electrified in 1908 and also introduced the term ''Schnellbahn'' (\"rapid railway\") in 1954 for its planned commuter railway network (which started operations in 1962). The S-Bahn label was sometimes used as well, but the name was only switched to [[S-Bahn Wien]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As for [[Munich]], a first breaking ground for an S-train-like rapid transport system, executed by the Nazi government of [[Adolf Hitler]], took place in 1938 in Lindwurmstrasse near what is now Goetheplatz underground station (line U6). Said system was supposed to run through tunnels in downtown areas. The planning process mainly consisted of the bundling and interconnecting of existing suburban and local railways, plus the construction fo a few new lines. Plans and construction work - inlcuding the building shell of Goetheplatz station - came to a very early halt during [[World War II]] and were not pursued in its aftermath. Very extensive nowadays, Munich's existing S-Bahn-System, together with the first two [[U-Bahn]] lines, began to operate prior to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] only.\n\nThe term ''S-Bahn'' was until 14 March 2012 a registered [[wordmark]] of [[Deutsche Bahn]], where at the request of a transportation association the [[Federal Patent Court of Germany]] ordered the wordmark to be removed from the records of the [[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt|German Patent and Trade Mark Office]].<ref>[http://juris.bundespatentgericht.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bpatg&Art=en&Datum=Aktuell&nr=23159&pos=1&anz=323&Blank=1.pdf Beschluss Bundespatentgericht vom 14. M\u00e4rz 2012]. Retrieved 14 April 2013.</ref> Prior to the said event Deutsche Bahn collected a royalty of 0.4 cents per train kilometer for the usage of the said term.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n[[File:Vesterport Station Main Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|Vesterport S-train station has three entrances. This is the main one.]]\n[[File:Vesterport STrain Station Platform and S-Trains.jpg|thumb|right|Vesterport station is located below street level, but is not under ground. Other trains do not stop here, solely S-trains. Compare with picture of Berlin's S-train above. Same concept.]]\n[[File:Svanem\u00f8llen Station 01.jpg|left|thumb|Svanem\u00f8llen Station, main entrance]]\nThe \"S\" stood for \"station\". Just before the opening of the first line in the [[Copenhagen S-train]] network, the newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' on 17 February 1934 held a competition about the name, which in Danish became known as ''Den elektriske enquete'' or \"The electrical survey\" (as the Copenhagen S-trains would become the first electrical railways in Denmark). But since an \"S\" already was put up at all the stations, weeks before the survey, the result became ''S-tog'' which means \"S-train\".<ref name=\"poulsen 2009 47\">John Poulsen: S-bane 1934-2009 side 47</ref> This was also just a few years after the S-trains had opened in Berlin and Hamburg. Today the Copenhagen S-trains uses six lines and serves 85 stations, 32 of them are located inside the (quite tiny) municipality borders. Each line uses 6 t.p.h (trains per hour) in each direction, with exception of the (yellow) F-line. The F-line have departures in each direction every five minutes, or 12 t.p.h. service .<ref>http://www.dsb.dk/globalassets/pdf/koereplaner/s-tog/2017/s-tog-30jan17.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Germany ===\n\n==== Early steam services ====\nIn 1882, the growing number of [[Steam locomotive|steam-powered]] trains around Berlin prompted the Prussian State Railway to construct separate rail tracks for suburban traffic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The ''Berliner Stadtbahn'' connected Berlin's eight intercity rail stations which were spread throughout the city (all but the ''Stettiner Bahnhof'' which today is a pure S-train station known as [[Berlin Nordbahnhof]]; as the city ''Stettin'' today is Polish city [[Szczecin]]). A lower rate for the newly founded ''Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn'' (Berlin City, Circular and Suburban Rail) was introduced on 1 October 1891. This rate and the growing succession of trains made the short-distance service stand out from other railways.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe second suburban railway was the ''[[Hamburg]]-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn'' connecting Hamburg with [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] and [[Blankenese]]. The Altona office of the Prussian State Railway established the electric powered railway in 1906.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">See picture of Berliner Stadtbahn by Hackescher Markt S-train station, the third rail is clearly seen between the two S-Train tracks. Original name of that station was \"B\u00f6rse\", or \"the Stock Market\" (which now is located in Frankfurt am Main)</ref>\n\n==== Electricity ====\n[[File:Type 474 HH-Diebsteich.jpg|thumb|right|The Hamburg S-Bahn third rail system]]\nThe beginning of the 20th century saw the first electric trains, which in Germany operated at 15,000 [[Volt|V]] on [[overhead lines]]. The ''[[Berlin S-Bahn|Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn]]'' instead implemented [[direct current]] [[multiple unit]]s running on 750 V from a [[third rail]]. In 1924, the first electrified route went into service. The third rail was chosen because it made both the modifications of the rail tracks (especially in tunnels and under bridges) and the side-by-side use of electric and steam trains easier.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nTo set it apart from the subterranean ''[[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]'', the term ''S-Bahn'' replaced ''Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn'' in 1930.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe Hamburg service had established an [[alternating current]] line in 1907 with the use of multiple units with [[slam door]]s. In 1940 a new system with 1200 V DC third rail and modern [[electric multiple unit]]s with [[sliding door]]s was integrated on this line (on the same tracks). The old system with overhead wire remained up to 1955. The other lines of the network still used steam and later Diesel power. \nIn 1934, the ''Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn'' was renamed as S-Bahn.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Comparable Systems ==\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Cityjet in Floridsdorf.jpg|thumb|A [[Siemens Desiro Mainline]] EMU of the [[Vienna S-Bahn]]]]\n[[File:Bahnhof Heiligenstadt3.jpg|thumb|A [[\u00d6BB Class 4020|class 4020]] EMU on Vienna S-Bahn line S40]]\n[[File:Brussels S-train Siemens Desiro at Diegem.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Siemens Desiro Mainline]] EMU on Brussels S-train line S2]]\n[[File:S-train diagram.svg|thumb|right|Schematic map of Copenhagen S-train]]\n[[File:Karte der S-Bahn M\u00fcnchen.png|thumb|right|Map of the Munich S-Bahn network]]\n[[File:Karte S-Bahnnetze in Deutschland.svg|thumb|right|Map of S-Bahn networks in Germany]]\n[[File:TransperthRailwayMap.svg|thumb|right|A map of the Transperth railway network]]\n[[File:CPTM.svg|thumb|right|Map of S\u00e3o Paulo's CPTM network]]\n{{stack end}}\n\n===Australia===\n\n[[File:TfNSW T.svg|30px|left|Sydney Trains logo]] The [[Sydney Trains]] suburban rail network consists of nine lines converging in the underground [[City Circle]] with frequencies as high as three minutes in this section, 5\u201310 minutes at most major stations all day and 15 minutes at most minor stations all day.\n\n[[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne's rail network]] features sixteen electrified commuter rail lines traversing the city centre in the underground [[City Loop]] providing a metro-like service in the central core. A second underground core is under construction, as the [[Metro Tunnel]] project.\n\nCommuter rail services in [[Brisbane]] are provided under the [[Queensland Rail City network]] brand, featuring twelve electrified lines converging in the city centre. [[Cross River Rail]] is an under construction underground cross-city tunnel to relieve pressure on this network.\n\n[[Transperth Trains]] operates commuter rail services in the [[Perth]] metropolitan area, with the [[Joondalup railway line]] and [[Mandurah railway line]] operating at metro-like frequencies.\n\n=== Austria ===\n[[File:S-Bahn Austria.svg|30px|left|Austrian S-Bahn logo]]\n\nThe oldest and largest S-Bahn system in [[Austria]] is the [[Vienna S-Bahn]], which predominantly uses non exclusive rails tracks outside of [[Vienna]]. It was established in 1962, although it was usually referred to as ''Schnellbahn'' until 2005. The white \"S\" on a blue circle used as the logo is said to reflect the layout of the central railway line in Vienna. However, it has now been changed for a more stylized version that is used all through Austria, except Salzburg. The rolling stock was blue for a long time, reflecting the logo colour, but red is used uniformly for nearly all local traffic today.\n\n[[File:S-Bahn Salzburg.svg|30px|left|Salzburg S-Bahn logo]]\nIn 2004, the [[Salzburg S-Bahn]] went into service as the first [[Euroregion]] S-Bahn, crossing the border to the neighbouring towns of [[Freilassing]] and [[Berchtesgaden]] in [[Bavaria]]. The network is served by three corporations: the ''Berchtesgadener Land Bahn'' (BLB)(S4), the [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (German: ''\u00d6sterreichischen Bundesbahn'' / \u00d6BB)(S2 and S3) and the ''Salzburger Lokalbahn'' (SLB)(S1 and S11) and . The Salzburg S-Bahn logo is only different one, it is a white S on a light blue circle.\n\nIn 2006 the [[Regionalbahn|regional train]] line in the [[Alpine Rhine|Rhine Valley]] in the [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Vorarlberg]] has been renamed to ''[[S-Bahn Vorarlberg]]''. It is a three lines network, operated by the ''[[Montafonerbahn]]'' and the \u00d6BB.\n\nThe ''[[S-Bahn Steiermark]]'' has been inaugurated in December 2007 in [[Styria]], built to connect its capital city [[Graz]] with the rest of the metropolitan area, currently the following lines are active: S1, S11, S3, S31, S5, S51, S6, S61, S7, S8 and S9. The network is operated by three railway companies: the ''Graz-K\u00f6flacher Bahn'' (GKB) (lines: S6, S61 and S7), the \u00d6BB (lines: S1, S3, S5, S51, S8 and S9) and the ''Steierm\u00e4rkische Landesbahnen'' (StB) (lines: S11 and S31).\n\nIn December 2007 as well the [[Tyrol S-Bahn]] opened, running from [[Hall in Tirol]] in the east to [[Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof|Innsbruck Central Station]] and [[Telfs]] in the west and from Innsbruck to Steinach am Brenner. [[Bombardier Talent|Class 4024]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMUs]] are used as rolling stock on this network.\n\nIn 2010 the ''[[S-Bahn K\u00e4rnten]]'' was opened in the [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Carinthia]] and currently consists of 4 lines operated by \u00d6BB.\n\nThe youngest network is the ''[[S-Bahn Ober\u00f6sterreich]]'' in the Greater [[Linz]] area of the state of [[Upper Austria]], which was inaugurated in December 2016. It is a 5 line system operated by ''[[Stern und Hafferl Verkehr|Stern und Hafferl]]'' and the \u00d6BB.\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[File:NMBS S-Trein logo.svg|30px|left|Brussels ''S train'' logo]]\n\nThe suburban railways of [[Brussels]] are currently being integrated into the [[Brussels Regional Express Network]] (French: ''R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional Bruxellois'', ''RER''; Dutch: ''Gewestelijk ExpresNet'', GEN), which is identified by the letter ''S'' across both languages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/nmbs-releases-details-s-train-express-network|title=NMBS releases details of S-train express network|date=15 September 2015|author=Alan Hope|newspaper=Flanders Today}}</ref> In 2018, the S-train was also introduced in [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Charleroi]].<ref>[https://www.belgiantrain.be/nl/travel-info/train-offer/s-train S-train overview in Belgium (in Dutch)]</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\n[[File:CPTM (Logo).svg|60px|left|CPTM logo]] In [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos]] suburban rail network operates at high frequencies on tracks used exclusively for commuter traffic.\n\n[[SuperVia]] provides electrified commuter rail services in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n[[File:Esko Praha logo.svg|30px|left|Czech ''Esko'' logo]]\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]], integrated [[commuter rail]] systems exist in [[Prague]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.expats.cz/prague-metro/prague-train-map/|title=Prague Train Map - Prague, Czech Republic|date=2014-07-14|website=Expats.cz for Jobs in Prague - Prague Real Estate in the Czech Republic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> and [[Moravian-Silesian Region]]. Both systems are called ''Esko'', which is how ''S'' letter is usually called in Czech. [[Esko Prague]] has been operating since 9 December 2007 as a part of the [[Prague Integrated Transport]] system. [[Esko Moravian-Silesian Region]] began operating on 14 December 2008 as a part of the ODIS Integrated Transport system serving the Moravian-Silesian Region. Both systems are primarily operated by [[\u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy]]. Several shorter lines are operated by other companies.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n[[File:S-tog.svg|30px|left|Copenhagen S-tog logo]]\n\n[[Copenhagen S-train]] connects the city centre, other inner and outer boroughs and suburbs with each other. The average distance between stations is 2.0 [[km]], shorter in the city core and inner boroughs, longer at the end of lines that serve suburbs. Of the 85 stations, 32 are located within the central parts of the city. Some stations are located around 40&nbsp;km from Copenhagen city centre. For this reason the fares vary depending on distances. One-day-passes which tourist buy are valid only in the most central parts of the S-train system. Weekdays each line have departures every 10th minute with exception for the F-line, which departures every fifth minute. Where several lines use the same branches, up to around 30 trains per hour (in each direction) service exists. On Sundays the seven lines are reduced to four lines, but all stations are served at least every 10th minute. The three railway stations at [[Amager]] has a local service that equals the S-trains'.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] opened in 2002 as a complement to the already existing S-train system. Copenhagen's S-train system is the only one in the country. Outside Denmark, in cities where both exist, is it far from unusual that a metro system later has been complemented with S-trains. The branch towards [[K\u00f8ge]] (the southernmost S-train station in Copenhagen's S-network) has a rather unique history, as it was built in the 1970s where no previous railway ever had existed.\n\n=== Finland ===\n[[File:Helsingin l\u00e4hiliikenteen logo.png|left|30x30px|Helsinki commuter rail logo]]\nThe [[Helsinki commuter rail]] network is completely electrified with exclusive tracks running parallel to mainline rail tracks. The [[Ring Rail Line]] operates at ten-minute frequencies.\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:RER.svg|left|30x30px|Paris RER logo]]\nThe term ''R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional'' (lit. Regional Express Network) originally meant the [[Paris]] system, but is now used for other French networks as well. However, only the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Paris RER]] has underground corridors that operate with frequency and stop spacing of a rapid transit system similar to an S-Train.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:S-Bahn-Logo.svg|30px|left|German S-Bahn logo]]\n\nThe trains of the Berlin and Hamburg S-Bahn systems ran on separate tracks from the beginning. When other cities started implementing their systems in the 1960s, they mostly had to use the existing intercity rail tracks, and they still more or less use such tracks.\n\nThe [[Hauptbahnhof|central intercity stations]] of [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt]], [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof|Munich]] and [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|Stuttgart]] are [[terminal station]]s, so all three cities have monocentric S-Bahn networks. The S-Bahn trains use a tunnel under the central station and the city centre.\n\nThe high number of large cities in the [[Ruhr]] area promotes a polycentric network connecting all cities and suburbs. The ''[[Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn|S-Bahn Rhein-Ruhr]]'', as it is called, features few tunnels, and its routes are longer than those of other networks. The Ruhr S-Bahn is the only S-Bahn network to be run by more than one corporation in Germany, and the [[Salzburg]] S-Bahn holds a similar distinction in Austria. Most Swiss S-Bahn systems are multi-corporation networks, however.\n\nMost German S-Bahn networks have a unique ticket system, separated from the ''[[Deutsche Bahn]]'' rates, instead connected to the city ticket system used for U-bahns and local busses. The S-Bahn of [[Hanover]], however, operates under five different rates due to its large expanse.\n\nOne S-Bahn system is no longer in operation: the [[Erfurt S-Bahn]] which operated from 1976 until 1993 and was an {{convert|8.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} single-line system which consisted of four stations from [[Erfurt Central Station]] to Erfurt Berliner Stra\u00dfe station in the then newly built northern suburbs of [[Erfurt]].\n\nFuture S-Bahn systems are the [[Danube-Iller S-Bahn]] which is expected to enter service in December 2013, and the [[Augsburg S-Bahn]] which was originally planned to go into service in 2011 but has now been delayed to 2015. The S-Bahn system in [[L\u00fcbeck]] is under discussion (see [[:File:S-Bahn L\u00fcbeck.svg|network plan]]).\n\nThe [[Stadtbahn Karlsruhe]] (a [[tram-train]] network) uses the green \"S\" logo, but does not refer to itself as ''S-Bahn''. The blue ''[[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]'' logo is not used either, due to the lack of subterranean lines.\n\nDespite their names, the ''[[Breisgau S-Bahn]]'' ([[Freiburg]]) and the ''[[Ortenau S-Bahn]]'' ([[Offenburg]]) are both [[Regionalbahn]] services.\n\nThe following networks are currently in operation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

Most of the sections of the East and West Rail Lines are overground and some sections of the East Rail Line share tracks with intercity trains to [[mainland China]].  These lines are integrated into the MTR network and most passengers do not need to exit and reenter the system through separate fare gates and purchase separate tickets to transfer between such lines and the rest of the network (the exception is between the West Rail Line's East Tsim Sha Tsui station and the Tsuen Wan Line's Tsim Sha Tsui station).\n\n=== Hungary ===\n{{main|BH\u00c9V}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n\n[[KRL Commuterline]] or Commuter Line Jabodetabek is a commuter railway system serving Jakarta and its satellite cities as well as its regencies. The system currently has 6 lines, 80 stations, and it spans 480km with roughly 300 million passengers annually. The system only accept bank-issued cards and e-tickets which can be purchased or topped up at any stations throughout the system.\n\n=== Ireland ===\n* {{flag|Dublin}}\n** [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] fill the role of an S-train rail service in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], although only DART has the common spine running through the city centre that characterises other European S-train networks, although this runs on an elevated track, rather than underground.  The [[DART Underground]] project, suspended as of 2019, would upgrade this to a  more typical S-train network by the addition of an underground link running though the city's commercial centre to join with existing Western commuter services.\n\n=== Italy ===\nSeveral systems in Italy operate quite similar to S-Trains with numerous services funneling into the underground \"Passante\" or passing railway.\n\nOperating services in the country are:\n\n*[[Milan suburban railway service]], operated by [[Trenord]] and [[Azienda Trasporti Milanesi|ATM]] has numerous services funneling into the underground [[Milan Passante railway]]. \n*[[Turin metropolitan railway service]], operated by Ferrovie Regione Piemonte and [[Gruppo Torinese Trasporti|GTT]] with an underground railway running through the city, serviced by most lines. \n*[[Line 2 (Naples)|Naples Metro Line 2]] is an underground corridor where [[commuter rail]] services operated by [[Trenitalia]] traverse and service the urban center. \n*[[Bari metropolitan railway service]]\n\n=== Japan ===\n[[File:Tokyo metro map.png|thumb|[[Tokyo Metro]] and [[Toei Subway]] interoperate their trains into both JR and suburban rail lines. (through services denoted by thinner colour lines)]]\n[[Japan Railways Group]] (JR) operates train services with different classes on the same line. In [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]], there are various lines connecting the suburban areas and Central Tokyo by frequent \"Local\" and \"Rapid\" services, including [[Yamanote Line]], [[Keihin Tohoku Line]], [[Joban Line]], [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line|Chuo Line]], [[Osaka Loop Line]], etc.\n\nIn addition, Tokyo, Osaka, [[Nagoya]] and [[Fukuoka]] also boast numerous private railway companies such as [[Tobu Railway]], [[Meitetsu]] and [[Hanshin Electric Railway]] that operate equally extensive suburban rail networks. Most of them also [[Through train #Japan|interoperate]] their trains into the subway lines in the respective cities like [[Tokyo Metro]] and [[Nagoya Municipal Subway]].\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nSeveral systems in Malaysia operate quite similar to S-Trains, such as:\n\n*[[KTM Komuter]], operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]], mainly service in [[Klang Valley]] and [[Greater Penang]].\n*[[Express Rail Link]], airport s-train service which have shuttle (stop at every station) and bypass (only at KLIA anda KL Sentral) route.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[File:Randstadspoor.png|thumb|150px]]\n\"Randstadspoor\" is a network of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen#Types of train service|Sprinter]] train services in and around the city of [[Utrecht]], similar to S-trains. For the realisation of this network, five new stations were opened: [[Utrecht Zuilen railway station|Utrecht Zuilen]], [[Utrecht Terwijde railway station|Utrecht Terwijde]], [[Utrecht Leidsche Rijn railway station|Utrecht Leidsche Rijn]], [[Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn railway station|Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn]] and [[Houten Castellum railway station|Houten Castellum]]. Extra tracks have been built to create dedicated routes for these Sprinters, so they can call frequently without disturbing high-frequent Intercity services parallel to these routes.<ref>[[:nl:Randstadspoor|Randstadspoor]] on the Dutch Wikipedia</ref> Similar systems are planned for [[The Hague]] and [[Rotterdam]], the latter of which already has the [[Rotterdam Metro]] network.\n\n=== Russia ===\n[[File:Russian Railways Logo.svg|left|30x30px|Russian Raiways]]\nThe names \"S-Bahn\" and \"S-Train\" is not used in [[Russia]]. Officially, such a system is called an \"[[Urban electric transport in Russia|urban electric train]]\", or less often and unofficially \"ground metro\". These names are often used, even if non-electrified trains or rail buses are used as the rolling stock on the routes. The first similar project, implemented before the revolution, is the Oranienbaum Electric Line in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. Also, an approximate analogue was Beskudnikovskaya railway branch, which existed in [[Moscow]] between the 1940s and 1980s. The trains that shuttled along it did not go to the main lines, so it was a city transport. The system of high-speed rail transport, similar to S-Train:\n* [[Moscow Central Circle]]\n* [[Moscow Central Diameters]]\n* [[Nizhny Novgorod City Rail]]\n* Ekaterinburg City Rail\n* Novosibirsk City Rail\n* Kazan City Rail\n* Volgograd City Rail\n* Sochi City Rail\n* Rostov City Rail\n* Vladivostok City Rail\n* Chelyabinsk City Rail\n* Kaliningrad Ground Metro\n* Krasnoyarsk City Rail\n* Voronezh City Rail\n* Belgorod City Rail\n* Tambov City Rail\n* Perm City Rail\n* Ufa City Rail\n\n=== Serbia ===\n*{{flag|Belgrade}}\n[[BG Voz]] is an urban rail system that serves Serbian capital. It is fairly similar to German S-Bahn, but currently has only two lines, with plans for further expansion. Between early 1990s and mid-2010s, there was another system, known as [[Beovoz]], that was used to provide [[mass-transit]] service within the Belgrade [[metropolitan area]], as well as to nearby towns, similarly to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in Paris. Beovoz had more lines and far more stops than the current system. However, it was abandoned in favor of more accurate BG Voz, mostly due to inefficiency.\nWhile current lines rely mostly on the existing infrastructure, any further development means furthering capacities (railways expansion and new trains). \nPlans for further extension of system include another two lines, one of which should reach [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]].\n\n=== South Korea ===\n[[Seoul Subway Line 1]] is a collection of frequent surface running [[Korail]] commuter railway services that feed into a core 7.8&nbsp;km long underground section.\n\n=== Spain ===\n[[File:Cercanias Logo.svg|23px|left|Cercan\u00edas logo]]\n[[Madrid]]\u2019s [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]] commuter rail network runs mostly independently of other rail traffic and features several underground sections.\n\n[[Rodalies de Catalunya]] operates [[Barcelona]]'s suburban rail services which traverse the city centre in two underground trunk routes, the [[Meridiana Tunnel]] and [[Arag\u00f3 Tunnel]].\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n[[File: Stockholm commuter rail symbol.svg|23px]] SL operates the Pendelt\u00e5g network in the Stockholm metro area and it is integrated into the rest of the SL network.  Although most stations are at-grade or overground, Stockholm City, Stockholm Odenplan, and Stockholm South are among the stations that are underground.  Travelling on most destinations reachable from Stockholm's city centre costs the same as a subway (T-bana) or local bus ride and transfer windows between a Pendelt\u00e5g and subway/local bus are free within the validity of the fare purchased.  A supplement is charged for journeys involving Arlanda airport and/or Uppsala.  In addition to the Pendelt\u00e5g, SL operates the Roslagsbanan commuter rail network (also denoted by a J), which runs from Stockholm East station to the eastern and northeastern portions of Stockholm County and fares cost the same as a subway or local bus ride.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n''S-Bahn'' is also used in German-speaking Switzerland. While French publications of those networks translate it as ''RER'', the line numbers are still prefixed with an S (e. g. S2).\n\n[[File:S-Bahn Bern.svg|23px|left|Berne S-Bahn logo]]\nThe oldest network in Switzerland is the [[Bern S-Bahn]], established in stages from 1974 and has adopted the term S-Bahn since 1995. It is also the only one in Switzerland to use a coloured \"S\" logo. In 1990, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], which covers the largest area, went into service. S-Bahn services were set up in the course of the ''[[Rail 2000|Bahn 2000]]'' initiative in [[Central Switzerland]] (a collaborative network of ''[[Lucerne S-Bahn|S-Bahn Luzern]]'' and ''[[Zug Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn Zug]]''), [[St. Gallen]] (''[[St. Gallen S-Bahn|S-Bahn St. Gallen]]'') and [[Ticino]] (''[[Rete celere del Canton Ticino]]'').\n\nThe ''[[Basel trinational S-Bahn]]'' services the [[Basel metropolitan area]], thus providing cross-border transportation into both France and Germany. A tunnel connecting [[Basel]]'s two large intercity stations ([[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] and [[Basel SBB railway station|Basel SBB]]) is planned as ''[[Herzst\u00fcck Basel|Herzst\u00fcck Regio-S-Bahn Basel]]'' (lit. heart-piece Regio-S-Bahn Basel).\n\nThe ''[[R\u00e9seau Express Vaudois]]'' of [[Lausanne]] will be incorporated in the planned ''[[L\u00e9man S-Bahn|S-Bahn L\u00e9man]]'' (called ''RER L\u00e9man'' in French-speaking areas) around [[Lake Geneva]] (''fr. Lac L\u00e9man''). [[Geneva]] will be the second centre of this network. Transborder networks for the [[Lake Constance]]-adjacent [[States of Germany|German states]] [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]], the [[States of Austria|Austrian state]] [[Vorarlberg]] and the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss cantons]] [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[Thurgau]] are under discussion. Possible names are ''Bodensee-S-Bahn'' and ''[[Rhine#Switzerland|Alpenrhein]]-Bahn''.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n* {{flag|London}}\n** [[Crossrail]] is similar to S-trains with a central core section will be using a new 22 kilometres (14&nbsp;mi)-long east\u2013west twin tunnel under central [[London]], splitting into two branches at either end.\n** [[Thameslink]] brings together several branches from northern and southern suburbs and satellite towns in to a high frequency central tunnel underneath London.\n** The [[London Overground]], by contrast, skirts through the inner suburbs with lines mostly independent of each other, although there are several branches. The [[Watford DC line]], partly shared with underground trains, uses third rail, but parallels a main line using overhead wires. This arrangement is similar to that found in Berlin. The system's 10 lines are not numbered and do not have distinct colours, but are divided into 6 regions.\n* [[Liverpool]]\n** [[Merseyrail]] consists of two lines powered by third rail, both of which branch out at one end. At the other, the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] continues out of the city centre to a mainline rail interchange, while the [[Wirral Line]] has a city-centre loop.\n* {{flag|Birmingham}}\n** Birmingham's four suburban lines are colour-coded. The green line is diesel while the others are powered by overhead wires.\n* [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]\n** The [[Tyneside Electrics]] system existed from 1904 to 1967 using DC third rail. [[British Rail]] did not have the budget to maintain the ageing electrification system. The [[Riverside Branch]] was closed, while the remaining lines were de-electrified. 13 years later, they were re-electrified using DC overhead wires, and now form the [[Tyne & Wear Metro]] Yellow Line.\n* [[Glasgow]]\n** Many of the rail lines around Glasgow are branded as [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]]. The trains used for these used to carry a different livery from the standard livery used by Scottish trains. The network includes most electrified Scottish rail routes.\n* [[Bristol]]\n** [[MetroWest (Bristol)|MetroWest]] is a proposed 5-line network in [[Bristol]], northern [[Somerset]] & southern [[Gloucestershire]]. The four-tracking of the line between [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] stations will enable local rail services to be separated from long-distance trains.\n\n=== United States ===\n* [[Philadelphia]] - [[SEPTA Regional Rail]] features a [[Center City Commuter Connection|tunneled corridor]] through the city center and through-routed services from several commuter lines. The arrangement of lines through the connection was originally modeled on European S-trains, under a plan proposed by [[Vukan Vuchic]] and Shinya Kikuchi in 1984 and 1985.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vuchich|first1=Vukan|last2=Kikuchi|first2=Shinya|title=General Operations Plan for the SEPTA Regional High Speed System.|date=1984|publisher=[[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]]|pages=5-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vukich|first1=Vukan|last2=Kikuchi|first2=Shinya|title=Planning an Integrated Regional Rail Network: Philadelphia Case|journal=Transportation Research Record|date=1985|pages=52\u201357}}</ref> However, several of the lines extend well out from the city through less densely populated areas. On the whole, the system is more like a [[RegionalBahn]] in scale.\n* [[San Francisco]] Bay Area - [[BART]] has operations similar to an S-Bahn in that both are hybrids between a [[rapid transit]] system and a [[commuter rail]] system. BART has a [[Market Street Subway|main tunneled corridor]] where services from several branches of suburban surface trackage funnel into. However BART is completely separated with from all traffic and is commonly classified as a rapid transit system.\n* [[New York City]] - The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] operates the [[Long Island Railroad]] and [[Metro North Railroad]], commuter rail lines which service points within New York City, along with suburbs. On weekends, riders can purchase a subsidized \"city-ticket\" which allows them to travel within the New York City fare zone for $4 (one-way).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Commuter rail]]\n* [[U-Bahn]]\n* [[Urban rail transit]]\n* [[Train categories in Europe]]\n* [[List of suburban and commuter rail systems]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{S-Bahn systems in Germany}}\n{{S-Bahn systems in Austria}}\n{{S-Bahn systems in Switzerland}}\n\n[[Category:S-Bahn| ]]\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Germany|*]]\n[[Category:S-Bahn in Austria|*]]\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Switzerland|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|S Train (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n<!--''This article has been partially translated from the German Wikipedia article.''-->\n[[File:Shema U-Bahn S-Bahn.PNG|thumb|270x270px|Schema comparing [[rapid transit]] (left) with S-Trains (Right).

Compare with photo of Vesterport station in Copenhagen below. The concept is the same.]]\nThe '''S-train''' is a type of hybrid [[urban rail|urban]]-[[suburban rail]] serving a [[metropolitan region]]. Some of the larger S-train systems provide service similar to [[rapid transit]] systems, while smaller ones often resemble [[Commuter rail|commuter]] or even [[regional rail]]. They are especially common in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], where they are known as '''S-Bahn''', which in the 1930s was an abbreviation of either ''Schnellbahn'', ''Stadtbahn'' or ''Stadtschnellbahn'', depending on the city, but they must not be confused with ''U-Stadtbahnen''.<ref>See example of this for [[Stuttgart]] (\"Warum Stuttgart trotz U keine U-Bahn hat\" ; literal translation: \"Why does Stuttgart despite the U lack a U-Bahn (=Metro/Underground/Subway) [http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.stadtbahn-warum-stuttgart-trotz-u-keine-u-bahn-hat.6d3354e2-da68-4a5e-b84a-c6bc352ab87e.html]</ref>  Similar S-train systems exist also in [[Switzerland]] known as S-Bahn as well. In [[Denmark]], they are known as '''S-tog''' {{IPA-da|\u02c8\u025bs\u02ccts\u02b0\u0254\u02c0w|}}, in the [[Czech Republic]] as '''Esko''' or '''S-lines''', and northern [[Italy]] as '''Servizio ferroviario''' followed by either the word \"metropolitano\" (in [[Turin]]) or \"suburbano\" (in [[Milan]]).\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThere is no complete definition of an S-train system. S-trains are, where they exist, the most local type of railway stopping at all existing stations inside and around a city, while other mainline trains only call at major stations. They are slower than mainline railways but usually serve as fast crosstown services within the city.  S-trains generally service the hinterland of a certain city, rather than connecting different cities, although in high population density areas a few exceptions from this exist. A good example of a such exception is the [[Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn]], which interconnects the cities, towns and suburbs of the [[Ruhr]], a large [[urban agglomeration]], not unlike the large net of regional trains which also serve the area. Most S-train systems are entirely built on older local railways, or in some cases parallel to an existing dual track railway. Most use existing local mainline railway trackage, but a few branches and lines can be purpose built S-train lines.<ref>An example of this is the ''K\u00f8gebugt'' or K\u00f8ge-Bay railway at Copenhagen, built 1971 to 1983 {{cite web |url=http://www.bane.dk/visArtikel.asp?artikelID=256 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050203185250/http://bane.dk/visArtikel.asp?artikelID=256 |archive-date=3 February 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://s-bahn-galerie.de/S_Bahn_Hamburg/Geschichte_HH.htm S-train tunnel at Hamburg between Central Station and Altona 1967-1979]</ref> S-trains typically use overhead lines or a third rail for traction power. In Hamburg the S-trains use both the methods, depending on which line is powered.<ref>http://s-bahn-galerie.de/S_Bahn_Hamburg/Geschichte_HH.htm</ref>\n\nIn smaller S-train systems and suburban sections of larger ones, S-trains typically share tracks with other rail traffic, with the [[Berlin S-Bahn]], [[Hamburg S-Bahn]] and [[Copenhagen S-train]] being notable exceptions. Busy S-train corridors sometimes have sections of exclusive trackage of their own but parallel to mainline railways. Many of the larger S-train systems will also have central corridors of exclusive trackage that individual suburban branches feed into, creating high frequency corridors. In many cases, the central corridor is a dedicated underground line in the city center with close stop spacing and a high combined frequency similar to metro systems. A good example of this is the [[Berliner Stadtbahn]] in the Berlin's S-Bahn, which is regarded as a tourist attraction.<ref name=\"stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de\">http://www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de/strecken/01/</ref><ref>same</ref> However, in more lightly used sections outside the city center, S-trains commonly share tracks with other train types.\n\nFurther out from the central parts of a city the individual services branch off into lines where the distances between stations can exceed 5&nbsp;km, similar to commuter rail. This allows the S-train to serve a dual transportation purpose: local transport within a city center and suburban transport between central boroughs of larger cities, and to suburbs. Frequencies vary wildly between systems with short headways in the core sections of large networks to headways of over 20 minutes in remote sections of the network, late at night and/or on Sundays and in smaller systems. The rolling stock typically used in S-Trains reflect its hybrid purpose. The interior is designed for short journeys with provision for standing passengers but may have more space allocated to larger and more numerous seats. Integration with other local transport for ticketing, connectivity and easy interchange between lines or other system like metros is typical for S-trains. Where both S-train and metro exist, the number of interchange stations between the two systems is substantial with metro tickets being valid on S-trains, and vice versa. The [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] constitutes the main local railway system for [[Leipzig]] but also connects to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], where a few stations are located. The [[Rostock S-Bahn]] is an example of a smaller S-Bahn system.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n=== Germany, Austria and Switzerland ===\nThe name ''S-Bahn'' (S-train) is an abbreviation for the German \"Stadtschnellbahn\" (meaning \"city rapid railway\") and was introduced in December 1930 in Berlin. The name was introduced at the time of the reconstruction of the suburban commuter train tracks&mdash; the first section to be electrified was a section of the [[Berlin\u2013Szczecin railway]] from [[Berlin Nordbahnhof]] to [[Bernau bei Berlin station]] in 1924, leading to the formation of the Berlin S-Bahn.<ref>http://www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de (in German)</ref>  On 17 February 1934, a competition was held by Politiken newspaper, asking its readers to submit their suggestions for what the new electric  rail system the jury voted unanimously for \"S-Line\".<ref name=\"cph post\">{{cite web |title=How the S-train got its S \u2013 The Post |url=http://cphpost.dk/history/how-the-s-train-got-its-s.html |website=cphpost.dk |publisher=CPH Post |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe main line [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] (English: ''City railway of Berlin'') was electrified with a 750 volt [[third rail]] in 1928 (some steam trains ran until 1929) and the circle line [[Berlin Ringbahn]] was electrified in 1929. The electrification continued on the radial suburban railway tracks along with changing the timetable of the train system into a rapid transit model with no more than 20 minutes headway per line where a number of lines overlapped on the main line. The system peaked during the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin to a train schedule below 2 minutes.<ref>http://www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de (in German); chose \"Geschichte\" (History)</ref>\n\nThe idea of heavy rail rapid transit was not unique to Berlin. Hamburg had an electric railway between the central station (\"Hauptbahnhof\") and Altona which opened in 1906 and in 1934 the system adopted the S-Bahn label from Berlin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The same year in Denmark, Copenhagen's [[S-tog]] opened its first line. In Austria, Vienna had its ''Stadtbahn'' main line electrified in 1908 and also introduced the term ''Schnellbahn'' (\"rapid railway\") in 1954 for its planned commuter railway network (which started operations in 1962). The S-Bahn label was sometimes used as well, but the name was only switched to [[S-Bahn Wien]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As for [[Munich]], a first breaking ground for an S-train-like rapid transport system, executed by the Nazi government of [[Adolf Hitler]], took place in 1938 in Lindwurmstrasse near what is now Goetheplatz underground station (line U6). Said system was supposed to run through tunnels in downtown areas. The planning process mainly consisted of the bundling and interconnecting of existing suburban and local railways, plus the construction fo a few new lines. Plans and construction work - inlcuding the building shell of Goetheplatz station - came to a very early halt during [[World War II]] and were not pursued in its aftermath. Very extensive nowadays, Munich's existing S-Bahn-System, together with the first two [[U-Bahn]] lines, began to operate prior to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] only.\n\nThe term ''S-Bahn'' was until 14 March 2012 a registered [[wordmark]] of [[Deutsche Bahn]], where at the request of a transportation association the [[Federal Patent Court of Germany]] ordered the wordmark to be removed from the records of the [[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt|German Patent and Trade Mark Office]].<ref>[http://juris.bundespatentgericht.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bpatg&Art=en&Datum=Aktuell&nr=23159&pos=1&anz=323&Blank=1.pdf Beschluss Bundespatentgericht vom 14. M\u00e4rz 2012]. Retrieved 14 April 2013.</ref> Prior to the said event Deutsche Bahn collected a royalty of 0.4 cents per train kilometer for the usage of the said term.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n[[File:Vesterport Station Main Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|Vesterport S-train station has three entrances.

Same concept.]]\n[[File:Svanem\u00f8llen Station 01.jpg|left|thumb|Svanem\u00f8llen Station, main entrance]]\nThe \"S\" stood for \"station\". Just before the opening of the first line in the [[Copenhagen S-train]] network, the newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' on 17 February 1934 held a competition about the name, which in Danish became known as ''Den elektriske enquete'' or \"The electrical survey\" (as the Copenhagen S-trains would become the first electrical railways in Denmark). But since an \"S\" already was put up at all the stations, weeks before the survey, the result became ''S-tog'' which means \"S-train\".<ref name=\"poulsen 2009 47\">John Poulsen: S-bane 1934-2009 side 47</ref> This was also just a few years after the S-trains had opened in Berlin and Hamburg. Today the Copenhagen S-trains uses six lines and serves 85 stations, 32 of them are located inside the (quite tiny) municipality borders. Each line uses 6 t.p.h (trains per hour) in each direction, with exception of the (yellow) F-line. The F-line have departures in each direction every five minutes, or 12 t.p.h. service .<ref>http://www.dsb.dk/globalassets/pdf/koereplaner/s-tog/2017/s-tog-30jan17.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Germany ===\n\n==== Early steam services ====\nIn 1882, the growing number of [[Steam locomotive|steam-powered]] trains around Berlin prompted the Prussian State Railway to construct separate rail tracks for suburban traffic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The ''Berliner Stadtbahn'' connected Berlin's eight intercity rail stations which were spread throughout the city (all but the ''Stettiner Bahnhof'' which today is a pure S-train station known as [[Berlin Nordbahnhof]]; as the city ''Stettin'' today is Polish city [[Szczecin]]). A lower rate for the newly founded ''Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn'' (Berlin City, Circular and Suburban Rail) was introduced on 1 October 1891. This rate and the growing succession of trains made the short-distance service stand out from other railways.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe second suburban railway was the ''[[Hamburg]]-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn'' connecting Hamburg with [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] and [[Blankenese]]. The Altona office of the Prussian State Railway established the electric powered railway in 1906.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">See picture of Berliner Stadtbahn by Hackescher Markt S-train station, the third rail is clearly seen between the two S-Train tracks. Original name of that station was \"B\u00f6rse\", or \"the Stock Market\" (which now is located in Frankfurt am Main)</ref>\n\n==== Electricity ====\n[[File:Type 474 HH-Diebsteich.jpg|thumb|right|The Hamburg S-Bahn third rail system]]\nThe beginning of the 20th century saw the first electric trains, which in Germany operated at 15,000 [[Volt|V]] on [[overhead lines]]. The ''[[Berlin S-Bahn|Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn]]'' instead implemented [[direct current]] [[multiple unit]]s running on 750 V from a [[third rail]]. In 1924, the first electrified route went into service. The third rail was chosen because it made both the modifications of the rail tracks (especially in tunnels and under bridges) and the side-by-side use of electric and steam trains easier.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nTo set it apart from the subterranean ''[[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]'', the term ''S-Bahn'' replaced ''Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn'' in 1930.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe Hamburg service had established an [[alternating current]] line in 1907 with the use of multiple units with [[slam door]]s. In 1940 a new system with 1200 V DC third rail and modern [[electric multiple unit]]s with [[sliding door]]s was integrated on this line (on the same tracks). The old system with overhead wire remained up to 1955. The other lines of the network still used steam and later Diesel power. \nIn 1934, the ''Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn'' was renamed as S-Bahn.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Comparable Systems ==\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Cityjet in Floridsdorf.jpg|thumb|A [[Siemens Desiro Mainline]] EMU of the [[Vienna S-Bahn]]]]\n[[File:Bahnhof Heiligenstadt3.jpg|thumb|A [[\u00d6BB Class 4020|class 4020]] EMU on Vienna S-Bahn line S40]]\n[[File:Brussels S-train Siemens Desiro at Diegem.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Siemens Desiro Mainline]] EMU on Brussels S-train line S2]]\n[[File:S-train diagram.svg|thumb|right|Schematic map of Copenhagen S-train]]\n[[File:Karte der S-Bahn M\u00fcnchen.png|thumb|right|Map of the Munich S-Bahn network]]\n[[File:Karte S-Bahnnetze in Deutschland.svg|thumb|right|Map of S-Bahn networks in Germany]]\n[[File:TransperthRailwayMap.svg|thumb|right|A map of the Transperth railway network]]\n[[File:CPTM.svg|thumb|right|Map of S\u00e3o Paulo's CPTM network]]\n{{stack end}}\n\n===Australia===\n\n[[File:TfNSW T.svg|30px|left|Sydney Trains logo]] The [[Sydney Trains]] suburban rail network consists of nine lines converging in the underground [[City Circle]] with frequencies as high as three minutes in this section, 5\u201310 minutes at most major stations all day and 15 minutes at most minor stations all day.\n\n[[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne's rail network]] features sixteen electrified commuter rail lines traversing the city centre in the underground [[City Loop]] providing a metro-like service in the central core. A second underground core is under construction, as the [[Metro Tunnel]] project.\n\nCommuter rail services in [[Brisbane]] are provided under the [[Queensland Rail City network]] brand, featuring twelve electrified lines converging in the city centre. [[Cross River Rail]] is an under construction underground cross-city tunnel to relieve pressure on this network.\n\n[[Transperth Trains]] operates commuter rail services in the [[Perth]] metropolitan area, with the [[Joondalup railway line]] and [[Mandurah railway line]] operating at metro-like frequencies.\n\n=== Austria ===\n[[File:S-Bahn Austria.svg|30px|left|Austrian S-Bahn logo]]\n\nThe oldest and largest S-Bahn system in [[Austria]] is the [[Vienna S-Bahn]], which predominantly uses non exclusive rails tracks outside of [[Vienna]]. It was established in 1962, although it was usually referred to as ''Schnellbahn'' until 2005. The white \"S\" on a blue circle used as the logo is said to reflect the layout of the central railway line in Vienna. However, it has now been changed for a more stylized version that is used all through Austria, except Salzburg. The rolling stock was blue for a long time, reflecting the logo colour, but red is used uniformly for nearly all local traffic today.\n\n[[File:S-Bahn Salzburg.svg|30px|left|Salzburg S-Bahn logo]]\nIn 2004, the [[Salzburg S-Bahn]] went into service as the first [[Euroregion]] S-Bahn, crossing the border to the neighbouring towns of [[Freilassing]] and [[Berchtesgaden]] in [[Bavaria]]. The network is served by three corporations: the ''Berchtesgadener Land Bahn'' (BLB)(S4), the [[Austrian Federal Railways]] (German: ''\u00d6sterreichischen Bundesbahn'' / \u00d6BB)(S2 and S3) and the ''Salzburger Lokalbahn'' (SLB)(S1 and S11) and . The Salzburg S-Bahn logo is only different one, it is a white S on a light blue circle.\n\nIn 2006 the [[Regionalbahn|regional train]] line in the [[Alpine Rhine|Rhine Valley]] in the [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Vorarlberg]] has been renamed to ''[[S-Bahn Vorarlberg]]''. It is a three lines network, operated by the ''[[Montafonerbahn]]'' and the \u00d6BB.\n\nThe ''[[S-Bahn Steiermark]]'' has been inaugurated in December 2007 in [[Styria]], built to connect its capital city [[Graz]] with the rest of the metropolitan area, currently the following lines are active: S1, S11, S3, S31, S5, S51, S6, S61, S7, S8 and S9. The network is operated by three railway companies: the ''Graz-K\u00f6flacher Bahn'' (GKB) (lines: S6, S61 and S7), the \u00d6BB (lines: S1, S3, S5, S51, S8 and S9) and the ''Steierm\u00e4rkische Landesbahnen'' (StB) (lines: S11 and S31).\n\nIn December 2007 as well the [[Tyrol S-Bahn]] opened, running from [[Hall in Tirol]] in the east to [[Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof|Innsbruck Central Station]] and [[Telfs]] in the west and from Innsbruck to Steinach am Brenner. [[Bombardier Talent|Class 4024]] [[Electric multiple unit|EMUs]] are used as rolling stock on this network.\n\nIn 2010 the ''[[S-Bahn K\u00e4rnten]]'' was opened in the [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Carinthia]] and currently consists of 4 lines operated by \u00d6BB.\n\nThe youngest network is the ''[[S-Bahn Ober\u00f6sterreich]]'' in the Greater [[Linz]] area of the state of [[Upper Austria]], which was inaugurated in December 2016. It is a 5 line system operated by ''[[Stern und Hafferl Verkehr|Stern und Hafferl]]'' and the \u00d6BB.\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[File:NMBS S-Trein logo.svg|30px|left|Brussels ''S train'' logo]]\n\nThe suburban railways of [[Brussels]] are currently being integrated into the [[Brussels Regional Express Network]] (French: ''R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional Bruxellois'', ''RER''; Dutch: ''Gewestelijk ExpresNet'', GEN), which is identified by the letter ''S'' across both languages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/nmbs-releases-details-s-train-express-network|title=NMBS releases details of S-train express network|date=15 September 2015|author=Alan Hope|newspaper=Flanders Today}}</ref> In 2018, the S-train was also introduced in [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Charleroi]].<ref>[https://www.belgiantrain.be/nl/travel-info/train-offer/s-train S-train overview in Belgium (in Dutch)]</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\n[[File:CPTM (Logo).svg|60px|left|CPTM logo]] In [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos]] suburban rail network operates at high frequencies on tracks used exclusively for commuter traffic.\n\n[[SuperVia]] provides electrified commuter rail services in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n[[File:Esko Praha logo.svg|30px|left|Czech ''Esko'' logo]]\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]], integrated [[commuter rail]] systems exist in [[Prague]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.expats.cz/prague-metro/prague-train-map/|title=Prague Train Map - Prague, Czech Republic|date=2014-07-14|website=Expats.cz for Jobs in Prague - Prague Real Estate in the Czech Republic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> and [[Moravian-Silesian Region]]. Both systems are called ''Esko'', which is how ''S'' letter is usually called in Czech. [[Esko Prague]] has been operating since 9 December 2007 as a part of the [[Prague Integrated Transport]] system. [[Esko Moravian-Silesian Region]] began operating on 14 December 2008 as a part of the ODIS Integrated Transport system serving the Moravian-Silesian Region. Both systems are primarily operated by [[\u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy]]. Several shorter lines are operated by other companies.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n[[File:S-tog.svg|30px|left|Copenhagen S-tog logo]]\n\n[[Copenhagen S-train]] connects the city centre, other inner and outer boroughs and suburbs with each other. The average distance between stations is 2.0 [[km]], shorter in the city core and inner boroughs, longer at the end of lines that serve suburbs. Of the 85 stations, 32 are located within the central parts of the city. Some stations are located around 40&nbsp;km from Copenhagen city centre. For this reason the fares vary depending on distances. One-day-passes which tourist buy are valid only in the most central parts of the S-train system. Weekdays each line have departures every 10th minute with exception for the F-line, which departures every fifth minute. Where several lines use the same branches, up to around 30 trains per hour (in each direction) service exists. On Sundays the seven lines are reduced to four lines, but all stations are served at least every 10th minute. The three railway stations at [[Amager]] has a local service that equals the S-trains'.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] opened in 2002 as a complement to the already existing S-train system. Copenhagen's S-train system is the only one in the country. Outside Denmark, in cities where both exist, is it far from unusual that a metro system later has been complemented with S-trains. The branch towards [[K\u00f8ge]] (the southernmost S-train station in Copenhagen's S-network) has a rather unique history, as it was built in the 1970s where no previous railway ever had existed.\n\n=== Finland ===\n[[File:Helsingin l\u00e4hiliikenteen logo.png|left|30x30px|Helsinki commuter rail logo]]\nThe [[Helsinki commuter rail]] network is completely electrified with exclusive tracks running parallel to mainline rail tracks. The [[Ring Rail Line]] operates at ten-minute frequencies.\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:RER.svg|left|30x30px|Paris RER logo]]\nThe term ''R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional'' (lit. Regional Express Network) originally meant the [[Paris]] system, but is now used for other French networks as well. However, only the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Paris RER]] has underground corridors that operate with frequency and stop spacing of a rapid transit system similar to an S-Train.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:S-Bahn-Logo.svg|30px|left|German S-Bahn logo]]\n\nThe trains of the Berlin and Hamburg S-Bahn systems ran on separate tracks from the beginning. When other cities started implementing their systems in the 1960s, they mostly had to use the existing intercity rail tracks, and they still more or less use such tracks.\n\nThe [[Hauptbahnhof|central intercity stations]] of [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt]], [[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof|Munich]] and [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|Stuttgart]] are [[terminal station]]s, so all three cities have monocentric S-Bahn networks. The S-Bahn trains use a tunnel under the central station and the city centre.\n\nThe high number of large cities in the [[Ruhr]] area promotes a polycentric network connecting all cities and suburbs. The ''[[Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn|S-Bahn Rhein-Ruhr]]'', as it is called, features few tunnels, and its routes are longer than those of other networks. The Ruhr S-Bahn is the only S-Bahn network to be run by more than one corporation in Germany, and the [[Salzburg]] S-Bahn holds a similar distinction in Austria. Most Swiss S-Bahn systems are multi-corporation networks, however.\n\nMost German S-Bahn networks have a unique ticket system, separated from the ''[[Deutsche Bahn]]'' rates, instead connected to the city ticket system used for U-bahns and local busses. The S-Bahn of [[Hanover]], however, operates under five different rates due to its large expanse.\n\nOne S-Bahn system is no longer in operation: the [[Erfurt S-Bahn]] which operated from 1976 until 1993 and was an {{convert|8.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} single-line system which consisted of four stations from [[Erfurt Central Station]] to Erfurt Berliner Stra\u00dfe station in the then newly built northern suburbs of [[Erfurt]].\n\nFuture S-Bahn systems are the [[Danube-Iller S-Bahn]] which is expected to enter service in December 2013, and the [[Augsburg S-Bahn]] which was originally planned to go into service in 2011 but has now been delayed to 2015. The S-Bahn system in [[L\u00fcbeck]] is under discussion (see [[:File:S-Bahn L\u00fcbeck.svg|network plan]]).\n\nThe [[Stadtbahn Karlsruhe]] (a [[tram-train]] network) uses the green \"S\" logo, but does not refer to itself as ''S-Bahn''. The blue ''[[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]'' logo is not used either, due to the lack of subterranean lines.\n\nDespite their names, the ''[[Breisgau S-Bahn]]'' ([[Freiburg]]) and the ''[[Ortenau S-Bahn]]'' ([[Offenburg]]) are both [[Regionalbahn]] services.\n\nThe following networks are currently in operation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

Most of the sections of the East and West Rail Lines are overground and some sections of the East Rail Line share tracks with intercity trains to [[mainland China]].  These lines are integrated into the MTR network and most passengers do not need to exit and reenter the system through separate fare gates and purchase separate tickets to transfer between such lines and the rest of the network (the exception is between the West Rail Line's East Tsim Sha Tsui station and the Tsuen Wan Line's Tsim Sha Tsui station).\n\n=== Hungary ===\n{{main|BH\u00c9V}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n\n[[KRL Commuterline]] or Commuter Line Jabodetabek is a commuter railway system serving Jakarta and its satellite cities as well as its regencies. The system currently has 6 lines, 80 stations, and it spans 480km with roughly 300 million passengers annually. The system only accept bank-issued cards and e-tickets which can be purchased or topped up at any stations throughout the system.\n\n=== Ireland ===\n* {{flag|Dublin}}\n** [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] fill the role of an S-train rail service in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], although only DART has the common spine running through the city centre that characterises other European S-train networks, although this runs on an elevated track, rather than underground.  The [[DART Underground]] project, suspended as of 2019, would upgrade this to a  more typical S-train network by the addition of an underground link running though the city's commercial centre to join with existing Western commuter services.\n\n=== Italy ===\nSeveral systems in Italy operate quite similar to S-Trains with numerous services funneling into the underground \"Passante\" or passing railway.\n\nOperating services in the country are:\n\n*[[Milan suburban railway service]], operated by [[Trenord]] and [[Azienda Trasporti Milanesi|ATM]] has numerous services funneling into the underground [[Milan Passante railway]]. \n*[[Turin metropolitan railway service]], operated by Ferrovie Regione Piemonte and [[Gruppo Torinese Trasporti|GTT]] with an underground railway running through the city, serviced by most lines. \n*[[Line 2 (Naples)|Naples Metro Line 2]] is an underground corridor where [[commuter rail]] services operated by [[Trenitalia]] traverse and service the urban center. \n*[[Bari metropolitan railway service]]\n\n=== Japan ===\n[[File:Tokyo metro map.png|thumb|[[Tokyo Metro]] and [[Toei Subway]] interoperate their trains into both JR and suburban rail lines. (through services denoted by thinner colour lines)]]\n[[Japan Railways Group]] (JR) operates train services with different classes on the same line. In [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]], there are various lines connecting the suburban areas and Central Tokyo by frequent \"Local\" and \"Rapid\" services, including [[Yamanote Line]], [[Keihin Tohoku Line]], [[Joban Line]], [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line|Chuo Line]], [[Osaka Loop Line]], etc.\n\nIn addition, Tokyo, Osaka, [[Nagoya]] and [[Fukuoka]] also boast numerous private railway companies such as [[Tobu Railway]], [[Meitetsu]] and [[Hanshin Electric Railway]] that operate equally extensive suburban rail networks. Most of them also [[Through train #Japan|interoperate]] their trains into the subway lines in the respective cities like [[Tokyo Metro]] and [[Nagoya Municipal Subway]].\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nSeveral systems in Malaysia operate quite similar to S-Trains, such as:\n\n*[[KTM Komuter]], operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]], mainly service in [[Klang Valley]] and [[Greater Penang]].\n*[[Express Rail Link]], airport s-train service which have shuttle (stop at every station) and bypass (only at KLIA anda KL Sentral) route.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[File:Randstadspoor.png|thumb|150px]]\n\"Randstadspoor\" is a network of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen#Types of train service|Sprinter]] train services in and around the city of [[Utrecht]], similar to S-trains. For the realisation of this network, five new stations were opened: [[Utrecht Zuilen railway station|Utrecht Zuilen]], [[Utrecht Terwijde railway station|Utrecht Terwijde]], [[Utrecht Leidsche Rijn railway station|Utrecht Leidsche Rijn]], [[Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn railway station|Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn]] and [[Houten Castellum railway station|Houten Castellum]]. Extra tracks have been built to create dedicated routes for these Sprinters, so they can call frequently without disturbing high-frequent Intercity services parallel to these routes.<ref>[[:nl:Randstadspoor|Randstadspoor]] on the Dutch Wikipedia</ref> Similar systems are planned for [[The Hague]] and [[Rotterdam]], the latter of which already has the [[Rotterdam Metro]] network.\n\n=== Russia ===\n[[File:Russian Railways Logo.svg|left|30x30px|Russian Raiways]]\nThe names \"S-Bahn\" and \"S-Train\" is not used in [[Russia]]. Officially, such a system is called an \"[[Urban electric transport in Russia|urban electric train]]\", or less often and unofficially \"ground metro\". These names are often used, even if non-electrified trains or rail buses are used as the rolling stock on the routes. The first similar project, implemented before the revolution, is the Oranienbaum Electric Line in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. Also, an approximate analogue was Beskudnikovskaya railway branch, which existed in [[Moscow]] between the 1940s and 1980s. The trains that shuttled along it did not go to the main lines, so it was a city transport. The system of high-speed rail transport, similar to S-Train:\n* [[Moscow Central Circle]]\n* [[Moscow Central Diameters]]\n* [[Nizhny Novgorod City Rail]]\n* Ekaterinburg City Rail\n* Novosibirsk City Rail\n* Kazan City Rail\n* Volgograd City Rail\n* Sochi City Rail\n* Rostov City Rail\n* Vladivostok City Rail\n* Chelyabinsk City Rail\n* Kaliningrad Ground Metro\n* Krasnoyarsk City Rail\n* Voronezh City Rail\n* Belgorod City Rail\n* Tambov City Rail\n* Perm City Rail\n* Ufa City Rail\n\n=== Serbia ===\n*{{flag|Belgrade}}\n[[BG Voz]] is an urban rail system that serves Serbian capital. It is fairly similar to German S-Bahn, but currently has only two lines, with plans for further expansion. Between early 1990s and mid-2010s, there was another system, known as [[Beovoz]], that was used to provide [[mass-transit]] service within the Belgrade [[metropolitan area]], as well as to nearby towns, similarly to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in Paris. Beovoz had more lines and far more stops than the current system. However, it was abandoned in favor of more accurate BG Voz, mostly due to inefficiency.\nWhile current lines rely mostly on the existing infrastructure, any further development means furthering capacities (railways expansion and new trains). \nPlans for further extension of system include another two lines, one of which should reach [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]].\n\n=== South Korea ===\n[[Seoul Subway Line 1]] is a collection of frequent surface running [[Korail]] commuter railway services that feed into a core 7.8&nbsp;km long underground section.\n\n=== Spain ===\n[[File:Cercanias Logo.svg|23px|left|Cercan\u00edas logo]]\n[[Madrid]]\u2019s [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]] commuter rail network runs mostly independently of other rail traffic and features several underground sections.\n\n[[Rodalies de Catalunya]] operates [[Barcelona]]'s suburban rail services which traverse the city centre in two underground trunk routes, the [[Meridiana Tunnel]] and [[Arag\u00f3 Tunnel]].\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n[[File: Stockholm commuter rail symbol.svg|23px]] SL operates the Pendelt\u00e5g network in the Stockholm metro area and it is integrated into the rest of the SL network.  Although most stations are at-grade or overground, Stockholm City, Stockholm Odenplan, and Stockholm South are among the stations that are underground.  Travelling on most destinations reachable from Stockholm's city centre costs the same as a subway (T-bana) or local bus ride and transfer windows between a Pendelt\u00e5g and subway/local bus are free within the validity of the fare purchased.  A supplement is charged for journeys involving Arlanda airport and/or Uppsala.  In addition to the Pendelt\u00e5g, SL operates the Roslagsbanan commuter rail network (also denoted by a J), which runs from Stockholm East station to the eastern and northeastern portions of Stockholm County and fares cost the same as a subway or local bus ride.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n''S-Bahn'' is also used in German-speaking Switzerland. While French publications of those networks translate it as ''RER'', the line numbers are still prefixed with an S (e. g. S2).\n\n[[File:S-Bahn Bern.svg|23px|left|Berne S-Bahn logo]]\nThe oldest network in Switzerland is the [[Bern S-Bahn]], established in stages from 1974 and has adopted the term S-Bahn since 1995. It is also the only one in Switzerland to use a coloured \"S\" logo. In 1990, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], which covers the largest area, went into service. S-Bahn services were set up in the course of the ''[[Rail 2000|Bahn 2000]]'' initiative in [[Central Switzerland]] (a collaborative network of ''[[Lucerne S-Bahn|S-Bahn Luzern]]'' and ''[[Zug Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn Zug]]''), [[St. Gallen]] (''[[St. Gallen S-Bahn|S-Bahn St. Gallen]]'') and [[Ticino]] (''[[Rete celere del Canton Ticino]]'').\n\nThe ''[[Basel trinational S-Bahn]]'' services the [[Basel metropolitan area]], thus providing cross-border transportation into both France and Germany. A tunnel connecting [[Basel]]'s two large intercity stations ([[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] and [[Basel SBB railway station|Basel SBB]]) is planned as ''[[Herzst\u00fcck Basel|Herzst\u00fcck Regio-S-Bahn Basel]]'' (lit. heart-piece Regio-S-Bahn Basel).\n\nThe ''[[R\u00e9seau Express Vaudois]]'' of [[Lausanne]] will be incorporated in the planned ''[[L\u00e9man S-Bahn|S-Bahn L\u00e9man]]'' (called ''RER L\u00e9man'' in French-speaking areas) around [[Lake Geneva]] (''fr. Lac L\u00e9man''). [[Geneva]] will be the second centre of this network. Transborder networks for the [[Lake Constance]]-adjacent [[States of Germany|German states]] [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]], the [[States of Austria|Austrian state]] [[Vorarlberg]] and the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss cantons]] [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[Thurgau]] are under discussion. Possible names are ''Bodensee-S-Bahn'' and ''[[Rhine#Switzerland|Alpenrhein]]-Bahn''.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n* {{flag|London}}\n** [[Crossrail]] is similar to S-trains with a central core section will be using a new 22 kilometres (14&nbsp;mi)-long east\u2013west twin tunnel under central [[London]], splitting into two branches at either end.\n** [[Thameslink]] brings together several branches from northern and southern suburbs and satellite towns in to a high frequency central tunnel underneath London.\n** The [[London Overground]], by contrast, skirts through the inner suburbs with lines mostly independent of each other, although there are several branches. The [[Watford DC line]], partly shared with underground trains, uses third rail, but parallels a main line using overhead wires. This arrangement is similar to that found in Berlin. The system's 10 lines are not numbered and do not have distinct colours, but are divided into 6 regions.\n* [[Liverpool]]\n** [[Merseyrail]] consists of two lines powered by third rail, both of which branch out at one end. At the other, the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] continues out of the city centre to a mainline rail interchange, while the [[Wirral Line]] has a city-centre loop.\n* {{flag|Birmingham}}\n** Birmingham's four suburban lines are colour-coded. The green line is diesel while the others are powered by overhead wires.\n* [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]\n** The [[Tyneside Electrics]] system existed from 1904 to 1967 using DC third rail. [[British Rail]] did not have the budget to maintain the ageing electrification system. The [[Riverside Branch]] was closed, while the remaining lines were de-electrified. 13 years later, they were re-electrified using DC overhead wires, and now form the [[Tyne & Wear Metro]] Yellow Line.\n* [[Glasgow]]\n** Many of the rail lines around Glasgow are branded as [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]]. The trains used for these used to carry a different livery from the standard livery used by Scottish trains. The network includes most electrified Scottish rail routes.\n* [[Bristol]]\n** [[MetroWest (Bristol)|MetroWest]] is a proposed 5-line network in [[Bristol]], northern [[Somerset]] & southern [[Gloucestershire]]. The four-tracking of the line between [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] stations will enable local rail services to be separated from long-distance trains.\n\n=== United States ===\n* [[Philadelphia]] - [[SEPTA Regional Rail]] features a [[Center City Commuter Connection|tunneled corridor]] through the city center and through-routed services from several commuter lines. The arrangement of lines through the connection was originally modeled on European S-trains, under a plan proposed by [[Vukan Vuchic]] and Shinya Kikuchi in 1984 and 1985.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vuchich|first1=Vukan|last2=Kikuchi|first2=Shinya|title=General Operations Plan for the SEPTA Regional High Speed System.|date=1984|publisher=[[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]]|pages=5-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vukich|first1=Vukan|last2=Kikuchi|first2=Shinya|title=Planning an Integrated Regional Rail Network: Philadelphia Case|journal=Transportation Research Record|date=1985|pages=52\u201357}}</ref> However, several of the lines extend well out from the city through less densely populated areas. On the whole, the system is more like a [[RegionalBahn]] in scale.\n* [[San Francisco]] Bay Area - [[BART]] has operations similar to an S-Bahn in that both are hybrids between a [[rapid transit]] system and a [[commuter rail]] system. BART has a [[Market Street Subway|main tunneled corridor]] where services from several branches of suburban surface trackage funnel into. However BART is completely separated with from all traffic and is commonly classified as a rapid transit system.\n* [[New York City]] - The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] operates the [[Long Island Railroad]] and [[Metro North Railroad]], commuter rail lines which service points within New York City, along with suburbs. On weekends, riders can purchase a subsidized \"city-ticket\" which allows them to travel within the New York City fare zone for $4 (one-way).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Commuter rail]]\n* [[U-Bahn]]\n* [[Urban rail transit]]\n* [[Train categories in Europe]]\n* [[List of suburban and commuter rail systems]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{S-Bahn systems in Germany}}\n{{S-Bahn systems in Austria}}\n{{S-Bahn systems in Switzerland}}\n\n[[Category:S-Bahn| ]]\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Germany|*]]\n[[Category:S-Bahn in Austria|*]]\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Switzerland|*]]\n", "name_user": "Nardog", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:fixingDanish IPA", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-train"}

[[Oersted's law]] and the [[oersted]] (Oe) are named after him.\n\nA leader of the [[Danish Golden Age]], \u00d8rsted was a close friend of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the brother of politician and jurist [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1853 to 1854.\n\n==Early life and studies==\n[[File:Hans Christian \u00d8rsted som ung.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The young H. C. \u00d8rsted]]\n\u00d8rsted was born in [[Rudk\u00f8bing]] in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who owned a pharmacy.<ref name=\"compilation\">{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/oersted.htm|title=Hans Christian \u00d8rsted |publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> He and his brother [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted|Anders]] received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the [[University of Copenhagen]], where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796, \u00d8rsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both [[aesthetics]] and [[physics]]. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] entitled ''The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics''.\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] reported his invention of the [[voltaic pile]], which inspired \u00d8rsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801, \u00d8rsted received a travel [[scholarship]] and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.<ref>[http://www.nbi.ku.dk/hhh/hco/oersted/uddannelsen/ Inspiration fra Europa - planer i K\u00f8benhavn] Niels Bohr Institute</ref>\n\nIn Germany \u00d8rsted met [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]], a physicist who believed there was a connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. This idea made sense to \u00d8rsted as he subscribed to [[Kantianism|Kantian]] thought regarding the unity of nature.<ref name=\"compilation\"/><ref>Brian, R.M. & Cohen, R.S. (2007). Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science, ''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 241.</ref> \u00d8rsted's conversations with Ritter drew him into the study of physics. He became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories.\n\n\u00d8rsted welcomed [[William Christopher Zeise]] to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812, \u00d8rsted again visited Germany and France after publishing ''Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love'' and ''F\u00f8rste Indledning til den Almindelige Naturl\u00e6re'' (1811).\n\n\u00d8rsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He used the Latin-German term ''Gedankenexperiment'' circa 1812 and the German term ''Gedankenversuch'' in 1820.<ref>Witt-Hansen, J., \"H.C. \u00d8rsted, Immanuel Kant and the Thought Experiment\", Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, Vol.13, (1976), pp. 48\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Electromagnetism==\n[[File:17. \u0415\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0435\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442.ogv|thumb|280px|A compass needle with a wire, showing the effect \u00d8rsted discovered.

[[Oersted's law]] and the [[oersted]] (Oe) are named after him.\n\nA leader of the [[Danish Golden Age]], \u00d8rsted was a close friend of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the brother of politician and jurist [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1853 to 1854.\n\n==Early life and studies==\n[[File:Hans Christian \u00d8rsted som ung.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The young H. C. \u00d8rsted]]\n\u00d8rsted was born in [[Rudk\u00f8bing]] in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who owned a pharmacy.<ref name=\"compilation\">{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/oersted.htm|title=Hans Christian \u00d8rsted |publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> He and his brother [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted|Anders]] received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the [[University of Copenhagen]], where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796, \u00d8rsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both [[aesthetics]] and [[physics]]. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] entitled ''The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics''.\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] reported his invention of the [[voltaic pile]], which inspired \u00d8rsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801, \u00d8rsted received a travel [[scholarship]] and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.<ref>[http://www.nbi.ku.dk/hhh/hco/oersted/uddannelsen/ Inspiration fra Europa - planer i K\u00f8benhavn] Niels Bohr Institute</ref>\n\nIn Germany \u00d8rsted met [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]], a physicist who believed there was a connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. This idea made sense to \u00d8rsted as he subscribed to [[Kantianism|Kantian]] thought regarding the unity of nature.<ref name=\"compilation\"/><ref>Brian, R.M. & Cohen, R.S. (2007). Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science, ''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 241.</ref> \u00d8rsted's conversations with Ritter drew him into the study of physics. He became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories.\n\n\u00d8rsted welcomed [[William Christopher Zeise]] to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812, \u00d8rsted again visited Germany and France after publishing ''Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love'' and ''F\u00f8rste Indledning til den Almindelige Naturl\u00e6re'' (1811).\n\n\u00d8rsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He used the Latin-German term ''Gedankenexperiment'' circa 1812 and the German term ''Gedankenversuch'' in 1820.<ref>Witt-Hansen, J., \"H.C. \u00d8rsted, Immanuel Kant and the Thought Experiment\", Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, Vol.13, (1976), pp. 48\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Electromagnetism==\n[[File:17. \u0415\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0435\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442.ogv|thumb|280px|A compass needle with a wire, showing the effect \u00d8rsted discovered.

In the year of county organization, [[Walter Leake]] served as governor and [[James Monroe]] as [[President of the United States]]. In 2004 Calling Panther Lake, commemorating this name, was opened up just West and North of Crystal Springs near the Jack and New Zion community.\n\nSoon after the Choctaw Indians relinquished their claims to this land in 1819 and the legislature formed Copiah County in 1823, Elisha Lott, a Methodist minister who had worked among the Indians, brought his family from Hancock County to a location near the present site of [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]].  When the [[New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad]] built in the area in 1858, a new town was created about a mile and a half west of the old settlement.  The new settlement took the name Crystal Springs and the old settlement became Old Crystal Springs.\n\nWilliam J. Willing's home was the first to be built in the new town, and [[Jefferson Davis]], president of the Confederacy, once made a speech from the front yard.  Ozious Osborne owned the first merchandise store on a corner of his residence lot on south Jackson Street.  This lot later became the Merchants Grocery Company's site.\n\nThe development of cotton agriculture in the county was based on , and the population was  before the Civil War.\n\nThe first church built was the Methodist in 1860 in Hazelhurst.<ref>Cain, J.B. ''Hazelhurst Methodist Church, 1860-1960: A History of Hazelhurst Methodist Church.'' Nashville, Tenn.: Parthenon, n.d. 104 pp.</ref> It was followed by the Baptist in 1861, Presbyterian in 1870. Trinity Episcopal was built in 1882, during a growth in the US Episcopal Church. After the American Civil War, most [[freedmen]] withdrew from white churches to establish their own independent congregations, setting up state associations of Baptists by the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe county expanded its production of commercial vegetable crops, known as truck farming, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Crystal Springs developed as one of the largest tomato shipping centers. Its commercial farming started in 1870 when the first shipment of peaches, grown by James Sturgis, was shipped to New Orleans and Chicago markets. Tomatoes were still known as \"love apples\" when N. Piazza imported seeds from Italy, and with help from S. H. Stackhouse, began scientific cultivation of tomato plants.  With the help of German immigrant Augustus Lotterhos, the industry achieved success.  In 1878, Lotterhos pooled the products of a number of tomato growers and shipped the first boxcar load to Denver, Colorado.<ref>James L.

In addition to working with the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Freedom Democratic Party]] in 1964 on voter registration and education, they organized to make progress after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965. With the aid  of [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]], to protect protesters working with the [[NAACP]] on boycotts of merchants in 1966 and 1967 in order to gain integration of public facilities and implement civil rights legislation. The Deacons for Defense had first been organized in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] in 1965 to protect African-American protesters, after considerable earlier violence in the state against protesters.<ref name=\"copiah\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPUaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=Copiah+Co,+MS+during+the+civil+rights+movement&source=bl&ots=fWipsZqqzH&sig=SZCEYQgyqG6sOzsEMqyVWVwerVs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMIraqO6s6IxgIVixCSCh0XHwAa#v=onepage&q=Copiah%20Co%2C%20MS%20during%20the%20civil%20rights%20movement&f=false Ted Ownby, ''The Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi''], Univ.

Its predominance was disrupted by the onset of World War II but it kept the title.\n\nIn June 2000, the town revived celebration of an annual Tomato Festival, held on the last Saturday in June. It includes a tomato growing contest (with prizes for largest tomato, ugliest tomato, prettiest tomato, etc.), tomato tasting, farmers' market, vendor's booths, musical entertainment, 5K run and, of course, the crowning of the new Tomato Queen. The Tomato Festival was originally set up on Front Street.\n\nThe Friday night before the Tomato Festival, a Street Dance is held as the kick-off event. It is the night of the crowning of the Tomato Queen. Entertainment includes a live band, games and amusement rides for the kids, and food vendors. During the Street Dance, \"BBQ and Blue Jeans\" is sponsored by the Junior Auxiliary of Crystal Springs. They sell take-out containers filled with BBQ sandwiches, potato salad, baked beans and a dinner roll. This is the evening when other festival vendors start setting up their booths for the main day events. Vendors come from all over the U.S. to the festival every year to sell their wares, and provide games and amusement rides. A tomato museum at the Chautauqua Park Visitor's Center exhibits historical pictures, agricultural relics from the era, and examples of some of the shipping and canning labels.\n\n==Education==\n* [[Copiah Academy]],<ref name=Ravitch1983>{{cite book|author=Diane Ravitch|title=The troubled crusade: American education, 1945-1980|url=https://archive.org/details/troubledcrusadea00ravi|url-access=registration|accessdate=September 7, 2012|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08756-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/troubledcrusadea00ravi/page/329 329]}}</ref>\n* [[Copiah County School District]]\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Cities===\n* [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]]\n* [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi|Hazlehurst]] (county seat)\n\n===Towns===\n* [[Georgetown, Mississippi|Georgetown]]\n* [[Wesson, Mississippi|Wesson]]\n\n===Village===\n* [[Beauregard, Mississippi|Beauregard]]\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n* [[Carpenter, Mississippi|Carpenter]]\n* [[Conn, Mississippi|Conn]]\n* [[Dentville, Mississippi|Dentville]] founded 1800  first baptist church was founded 1852  first church building erected in 1852 second building built in 1984  at one time dentville had 4 stores post office  and  Tabernacle methodist church which was  then later moved to present location on dentville road  a  12 grade school and a doctor\n* [[Gallman, Mississippi|Gallman]]\n* [[Glancy, Mississippi|Glancy]]\n* [[Hopewell, Copiah County, Mississippi|Hopewell]]\n* [[Martinsville, Mississippi|Martinsville]]\n* [[Midway, Copiah County, Mississippi|Midway]]\n* [[Rockport, Mississippi|Rockport]]\n* [[Ruby, Copiah County, Mississippi|Ruby]]\n* [[Sand Hill, Copiah County, Mississippi|Sand Hill]]\n\n===Ghost town===\n* [[Coars Springs, Mississippi|Coars Springs]]\n\n==Politics==\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

In the year of county organization, [[Walter Leake]] served as governor and [[James Monroe]] as [[President of the United States]]. In 2004 Calling Panther Lake, commemorating this name, was opened up just West and North of Crystal Springs near the Jack and New Zion community.\n\nSoon after the Choctaw Indians relinquished their claims to this land in 1819 and the legislature formed Copiah County in 1823, Elisha Lott, a Methodist minister who had worked among the Indians, brought his family from Hancock County to a location near the present site of [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]].  When the [[New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad]] built in the area in 1858, a new town was created about a mile and a half west of the old settlement.  The new settlement took the name Crystal Springs and the old settlement became Old Crystal Springs.\n\nWilliam J. Willing's home was the first to be built in the new town, and [[Jefferson Davis]], president of the Confederacy, once made a speech from the front yard.  Ozious Osborne owned the first merchandise store on a corner of his residence lot on south Jackson Street.  This lot later became the Merchants Grocery Company's site.\n\nThe development of cotton agriculture in the county was based on , and the population was  before the Civil War.\n\nThe first church built was the Methodist in 1860 in Hazelhurst.<ref>Cain, J.B. ''Hazelhurst Methodist Church, 1860-1960: A History of Hazelhurst Methodist Church.'' Nashville, Tenn.: Parthenon, n.d. 104 pp.</ref> It was followed by the Baptist in 1861, Presbyterian in 1870. Trinity Episcopal was built in 1882, during a growth in the US Episcopal Church. After the American Civil War, most [[freedmen]] withdrew from white churches to establish their own independent congregations, setting up state associations of Baptists by the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe county expanded its production of commercial vegetable crops, known as truck farming, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Crystal Springs developed as one of the largest tomato shipping centers. Its commercial farming started in 1870 when the first shipment of peaches, grown by James Sturgis, was shipped to New Orleans and Chicago markets. Tomatoes were still known as \"love apples\" when N. Piazza imported seeds from Italy, and with help from S. H. Stackhouse, began scientific cultivation of tomato plants.  With the help of German immigrant Augustus Lotterhos, the industry achieved success.  In 1878, Lotterhos pooled the products of a number of tomato growers and shipped the first boxcar load to Denver, Colorado.<ref>James L.

In addition to working with the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Freedom Democratic Party]] in 1964 on voter registration and education, they organized to make progress after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965. With the aid  of [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]], to protect protesters working with the [[NAACP]] on boycotts of merchants in 1966 and 1967 in order to gain integration of public facilities and implement civil rights legislation. The Deacons for Defense had first been organized in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] in 1965 to protect African-American protesters, after considerable earlier violence in the state against protesters.<ref name=\"copiah\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPUaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=Copiah+Co,+MS+during+the+civil+rights+movement&source=bl&ots=fWipsZqqzH&sig=SZCEYQgyqG6sOzsEMqyVWVwerVs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMIraqO6s6IxgIVixCSCh0XHwAa#v=onepage&q=Copiah%20Co%2C%20MS%20during%20the%20civil%20rights%20movement&f=false Ted Ownby, ''The Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi''], Univ.

Its predominance was disrupted by the onset of World War II but it kept the title.\n\nIn June 2000, the town revived celebration of an annual Tomato Festival, held on the last Saturday in June. It includes a tomato growing contest (with prizes for largest tomato, ugliest tomato, prettiest tomato, etc.), tomato tasting, farmers' market, vendor's booths, musical entertainment, 5K run and, of course, the crowning of the new Tomato Queen. The Tomato Festival was originally set up on Front Street.\n\nThe Friday night before the Tomato Festival, a Street Dance is held as the kick-off event. It is the night of the crowning of the Tomato Queen. Entertainment includes a live band, games and amusement rides for the kids, and food vendors. During the Street Dance, \"BBQ and Blue Jeans\" is sponsored by the Junior Auxiliary of Crystal Springs. They sell take-out containers filled with BBQ sandwiches, potato salad, baked beans and a dinner roll. This is the evening when other festival vendors start setting up their booths for the main day events. Vendors come from all over the U.S. to the festival every year to sell their wares, and provide games and amusement rides. A tomato museum at the Chautauqua Park Visitor's Center exhibits historical pictures, agricultural relics from the era, and examples of some of the shipping and canning labels.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Copiah Academy]],<ref name=Ravitch1983>{{cite book|author=Diane Ravitch|title=The troubled crusade: American education, 1945-1980|url=https://archive.org/details/troubledcrusadea00ravi|url-access=registration|accessdate=September 7, 2012|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08756-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/troubledcrusadea00ravi/page/329 329]}}</ref>\n*[[Copiah County School District]]\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Cities===\n*[[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]]\n*[[Hazlehurst, Mississippi|Hazlehurst]] (county seat)\n\n===Towns===\n*[[Georgetown, Mississippi|Georgetown]]\n*[[Wesson, Mississippi|Wesson]]\n\n===Village===\n*[[Beauregard, Mississippi|Beauregard]]\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n*[[Carpenter, Mississippi|Carpenter]]\n*[[Conn, Mississippi|Conn]]\n*[[Dentville, Mississippi|Dentville]] founded 1800  first baptist church was founded 1852  first church building erected in 1852 second building built in 1984  at one time dentville had 4 stores post office  and  Tabernacle methodist church which was  then later moved to present location on dentville road  a  12 grade school and a doctor \n*[[Gallman, Mississippi|Gallman]]\n*[[Glancy, Mississippi|Glancy]]\n*[[Hopewell, Copiah County, Mississippi|Hopewell]]\n*[[Martinsville, Mississippi|Martinsville]]\n*[[Midway, Copiah County, Mississippi|Midway]]\n*[[Rockport, Mississippi|Rockport]]\n*[[Ruby, Copiah County, Mississippi|Ruby]]\n*[[Sand Hill, Copiah County, Mississippi|Sand Hill]]\n\n===Ghost town===\n*[[Coars Springs, Mississippi|Coars Springs]]\n\n==Politics==\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Explicitly, this means that there is a continuous linear [[injection]] <math>\\operatorname{In} : X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y \\to X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> whose image is dense in <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> and that is a TVS-isomorphism onto its image. Using this map, <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> is identified as a subspace of <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>. \n\nAny continuous map on <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi}</math> can be extended to a unique continuous map on <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>. In particular, if <math>u : X_1 \\to Y_1</math> and <math>v : X_2 \\to Y_2</math> are continuous linear maps between locally convex spaces then their tensor product <math>u \\otimes v : X_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} Y_2 \\subseteq Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which is necessarily continuous, can be extended to a unique continuous linear function <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes} v : X_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>.\n\n== Properties ==\n* <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> is Hausdorff if and only if both ''X'' and ''Y'' are Hausdorff.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=437}}\n* The if \ud835\udf0f is a locally convex TVS topology on ''X \u2297 Y'' (''X \u2297 Y'' with this topology will be denoted by <math>X \\otimes_{\\tau} Y</math>), then \ud835\udf0f is equal to the \u03c0-topology if and only if it has the following property:{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=438}}\n:: For every locally convex TVS ''Z'', if ''I'' is the canonical map from the space of all bilinear mappings of the form <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>, going into the space of all linear mappings of <math>X \\otimes Y \\to Z</math>, then when the domain of ''I'' is restricted to <math>B\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math> then the range of this restriction is the space <math>L\\left( X \\otimes_{\\tau} Y; Z \\right)</math> of continuous linear operators <math>X \\otimes_{\\tau} Y \\to Z</math>.\n* In particular, the continuous dual space of <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> is canonically isomorphic to the space <math>B(X, Y)</math>, the space of continuous bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>.\n* Suppose that <math>u : X_1 \\to Y_1</math> and <math>v : X_2 \\to Y_2</math> are two linear maps between locally convex spaces.

The name has, however, its historical explanation. At the time of its foundation, ''Venstre'' affirmed then-progressive ideas in the Danish parliament. Their opponents, ''H\u00f8jre'' (Right), the forerunner of the present-day [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], advocated for established interests, particularly the [[Church of Denmark]] and the landed gentry. In current Danish politics there is a clear distinction between the concepts of ''Venstre'' (Left, i.e., the party bearing that name) and ''venstrefl\u00f8j'' (left wing, i.e., socialist and other left-leaning parties). The use of the word for \"left\" in the name of the Danish political party ''[[Det Radikale Venstre|Radikale Venstre]]'' and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] party ''[[Venstre (Norway)|Venstre]]'' is meant to refer to [[liberalism]] and not [[socialism]].\n\nMembers of the party are referred to as ''venstrem\u00e6nd'' and ''venstrekvinder'', respectively \"Venstre men\" and \"Venstre women\" (singular: -mand, -kvinde).\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Parliament===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After the party in 1872 gained an absolute majority in the [[Folketing]], it became the leading voice in the battle for [[parliamentarism]], whereafter the party in 1895 split in two, Venstrereformpartiet (\"Venstre Reform Party\") and Det Moderate Venstre (\"The Moderate Left\"). In 1905, social liberal factions split from the party and formed [[Radikale Venstre]] (also known as the Danish Social Liberal Party), and in 1910 Venstrereformpartiet and Det Moderate Venstre reunited again under the name Venstre.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/venstre/|title=Venstre|last=Bille|first=Lars|last2=R\u00fcdiger|first2=Mogens|website=danmarkshistorien.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\n=== 1910\u20132009 ===\nWith the decreasing numbers of farms and the growing urbanisation, membership and voter support dropped in the 1950s. During the 1960s the party gradually evolved from being a traditional farmers' party to a more general liberal party. In 1984 [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]] was elected chairman, and by profiling the liberal ideology in sharp confrontation to the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], for example by campaigning for a reduction of the public sector, increasing market management and privatisation, and by being pro-EU, the party returned to its historical position as the biggest liberal party in the 1990s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter a disappointing [[1998 Danish general election|1998 general election]], Ellemann-Jensen resigned as chairman and [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] was elected in his place. He immediately changed the party's usual confrontational strategy, instead appealing to the political centre. In the [[2001 Danish general election|2001 general elections]] the party campaigned for tighter immigration policies and a \"tax stop\", which proved successful and the party once again became the biggest in parliament, winning 31.2% of the vote and 56 seats. Venstre formed a coalition government with the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] and the [[Danish People's Party]]. For the first time since 1929 a liberal government was no longer dependent on the centre parties. Despite a small decline in both the [[2005 Danish general election|2005 general elections]] (29% and 52 seats) and the [[2007 Danish general election|2007 general elections]] (26.2% and 46 seats), the party remained the biggest and the coalition government continued.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 5 April 2009 Fogh Rasmussen resigned as chairman, instead serving as [[Secretary General of NATO]].

The name has, however, its historical explanation. At the time of its foundation, ''Venstre'' affirmed then-progressive ideas in the Danish parliament. Their opponents, ''H\u00f8jre'' (Right), the forerunner of the present-day [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], advocated for established interests, particularly the [[Church of Denmark]] and the landed gentry. In current Danish politics there is a clear distinction between the concepts of ''Venstre'' (Left, i.e., the party bearing that name) and ''venstrefl\u00f8j'' (left wing, i.e., socialist and other left-leaning parties). The use of the word for \"left\" in the name of the Danish political party ''[[Det Radikale Venstre|Radikale Venstre]]'' and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] party ''[[Venstre (Norway)|Venstre]]'' is meant to refer to [[liberalism]] and not [[socialism]].\n\nMembers of the party are referred to as ''venstrem\u00e6nd'' and ''venstrekvinder'', respectively \"Venstre men\" and \"Venstre women\" (singular: -mand, -kvinde).\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Parliament===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This version is a female version who is actually not a villain and a budding country music artist.\n\n==Publication history==\nFiddler first appeared in ''All-Flash'' #32 (December 1947/January 1948) and was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Lee Elias]].\n\nEarlier, a character with the same name, though only superficially similar, appeared in multiple Action Comic episodes of the Vigilante (starting with Action #59, April 1943 cover date.)\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Fiddler's history was changed somewhat during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\n===Pre-Crisis===\nThe Fiddler started out as a thief who was arrested in [[India]] and sent to jail. While in prison, he met a [[fakir]], [[snake charming|charming a snake]] in his cell, who taught him the \"mystic art\" of Indian music. For the next five years, he learned the fakir's secret and made a crude [[violin]] made of material he could scrounge in the prison. He developed the ability to use his violin to play sounds that could either hypnotize others, shatter objects, or create barriers.<ref name=\"dc-ency-aw\">{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Crazy Creations | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=92 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> After the fakir declared his student had surpassed him, he used the instrument to hypnotize the guards to open their cells and he and the fakir escaped. He then murdered the fakir and the merchant who had him arrested in the first place.\n\nReturning to [[United States|America]], the Fiddler, as he called himself, made his first stop at [[Keystone City]]. While the Fiddler managed to humiliate the Flash ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]) the first time they met, Flash was able to foil his plan, which involved replacing Maestro Bowin, a violin virtuoso, who was actually the Fiddler's twin brother. The physical similarity between the brothers (who had been separated at birth) also led to Bowin briefly being suspected of the Fiddler's crimes. The Fiddler captured his brother and Flash, but they escaped and the Fiddler apparently committed suicide by diving into a river.  As is the case more often than not, the Fiddler survived his plunge into the river and returned to battle the Flash again a few months later.  The villain refined his appearance, shaving his dark locks and donning the powered white wig that became his trademark for the remainder of his life. After the Flash thwarts a petty theft and arrests most of his gang, the Fiddler followed the hero at a distance but was in time to piece together a quarrel between Flash and Joan Williams. The exchange, with Joan annoyed at the time Flash's life took him away from home, inspired the Fiddler to undermine the hero. Using local criminals, the Fiddler arranged for \"common citizens\" (really members of his gang) to demonstrate that the Flash was not needed. As the Flash arrived always just in time to see the \"citizens\" route the criminals, he was advised to rest, relax or take a vacation. Eventually, the tricks took their toll and the Flash announced his retirement. As soon as he had supposedly departed, the Fiddler instigated a reign of terror across Keystone, staging almost daily robberies. One evening, Joan was particularly regretful of her admonition of the Flash and took it upon herself to resolve the situation. Using mirrors to blur her form and give her the illusion of speed, she donned a spare uniform and took up pursuit of the Fiddler. While the athletic Joan was quite capable of dealing with ordinary thugs, she was no match for a master criminal such as the Fiddler. To the criminal's astonishment,  The Flash appeared to be a woman. Nonetheless, the Fiddler resolved to dispose of her and tied her to the trellis of a nearby train track. As the train bore down on her bound form, the genuine Flash quickly rescued her and bore down on the Fiddler. Not to be easily taken, the Fiddler dove between the ties, falling to his presumed death (Flash Comics #93).\n\nSince then, he continued to plague the Flash again and again. He was a member of the second [[Injustice Society]], who captured the JSA and briefly put them under their control before [[Harlequin]] and [[Black Canary]] restored their memories. At Liberty Hall in Independence City, the citizens of that town have gathered ''en masse'' to protect the Freedom Bell from the Injustice Society, when strange music suddenly makes everyone want to dance. The music, played by the infamous Fiddler, works like a charm until Dr. Mid-Nite and Wonder Woman show up and seemingly put an end to the fiendish fiddle. But the Fiddler suddenly recovers, plays a few notes [which causes the Freedom Bell to fall on top the duo, trapping them], and he pumps gas inside to overcome them. Unfortunately for the Fiddler, the bell is cracked and the JSA pair survive the effects of the gas by breathing fresh air through that crack. Still, the Fiddler has been warned that, as a last resort, to snap his fingers to put the JSA members back under their hypnotic trance, which he does\u2014and all three then drive away in the Fiddler's Fiddlemobile with the bell in tow. The other JSA members are captured in this way, but again Black Canary and the Harlequin restore the JSAer's minds.\n\nLater, the Fiddler was part of a trio of criminals that caused the original Flash to come out of retirement. The Fiddler, along with the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]] and the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], were stopped by the first of many team-ups of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-One and Earth-Two]] heroes in the classic \"Flash of Two Worlds\" story from ''The Flash'' #123 (September 1961). [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], the Earth-1 Flash, visited Earth-2 accidentally and looked up his comic book hero, the original Flash. Together, the two Flashes stopped the villains, despite the Fiddler briefly placing them both under his control. This issue led to many other team-ups between Earth-1 and Earth-2 heroes and villains. The Fiddler, with the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] and [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] formed the \"Crime Champions\", who with the Crime Champions of Earth-1 ([[Doctor Alchemy]], [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]], and [[Felix Faust]]), tried to commit robberies after the Fiddler accidentally discovered a way to travel across the vibratory barriers between the Earths during a jailbreak. This led to the first JLA/JSA team-up. The Fiddler while committing a million-dollar robbery on Earth-2 escaped [[Hawkman]], the Earth-2 Flash, and the [[Atom (comics)]], though the Flashes from both Earths were captured and placed in vibratory spheres as they might recognize the criminals due to their ability to travel between Earths. Eventually the villains starting committing crimes on each other's worlds. Using the Wizard's Tibetan magic the Earth-2 crooks impersonated the Earth-1 crooks, the Fiddler impersonating [[Felix Faust]], and battling [[Aquaman]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], and the Atom. When the Fiddler tried to rob a Museum on Earth-1 in his true form, [[Hourman]] and the Earth-2 Atom stopped him. However the Justice Champions were imprisoned by the Crime Champions in cages in space, but the [[Green Lantern]]s helped them to escape and return to Earth, after which the crooks were defeated and jailed on their respective Earths.\n\nThe Fiddler uses a fiddle to control those around him. He travels around in his Fiddle Car, which Jay Garrick recognizes by sight.\n\n===Post-Crisis===\nThe son of [[United Kingdom|British]] aristocrats, '''Isaac Bowin''' had a talent for music, and an impulse to travel. Running out of money, he resorted to theft and robbery to make ends meet until he was arrested in [[India]] and sent to jail. He then met a fakir, much as in the pre-Crisis version.\n\nReturning to [[United States|America]] and taking on a new identity, that of the Fiddler, Bowin made his first stop at [[Keystone City]]. The main difference between this new origin and the original story is that he was aware Maestro Bowin was his twin and wanted to ruin his brother's good name. He continued to plague Jay Garrick for many years, eventually joining with the Thinker and the Shade to remove Keystone City from the world's vision and memory. Barry Allen inadvertently crossed the vibrational barrier the Fiddler created in [[Grant Morrison]]'s post-Crisis version of the first Jay/Barry team-up, \"Flash of Two Cities\" in ''Secret Origins'' #50 (August 1990). As in the original story, the two Flashes defeated the villains together.\n\nDuring the 1986 DC mini-series ''Legends'', the people of America are turned against heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate legally wearing a costume. \n \nFor the Fiddler this period proved an opportune time to join with his old comrade the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] in his new [[Injustice Society]], now called \"Injustice Unlimited\". They overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary, Canada, namely [[Infinity, Inc.]] and a contingent of the [[Global Guardians]]. They forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. The Fiddler took [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]] and the [[Green Flame]] to London and, with their help, stole a very prized Stradivarius violin. They then returned to Calgary to share in the stolen wealth being gathered by the Wizard but the plan went haywire when [[Hourman]] (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself, as well as when [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] was brought in from the Arctic Circle. It was Hourman who incapacitated the Fiddler by destroying the Stradivarius, and after the confusion he was taken into custody by Canadian law enforcement.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #35-37 (February\u2013April 1987)</ref>\n\nIn [[John Ostrander]]'s ''[[Hawkworld]]'' series, it was revealed that the fakir who taught Bowin his hypnotic skills was actually a [[demon]]. The Fiddler apparently dies in that story, but has resurfaced since (possibly through the machinations of the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], since the Fiddler first reappeared alive in Neron's assembly of supervillains in ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1). The same demon would turn a heavy-metal guitarist into a 1990s version of the Fiddler called the '''Thrasher'''. The Thrasher was defeated by [[Hawkman]], and has not reappeared. It is not clear if this version of the Fiddler's origin is still in continuity.\n\nAn '''Iowa Bowin''', claiming to be the Fiddler's great-grandson, appeared in ''Flash 80-Page Giant'' #2, in a story set in the future. Although his guitar-based version of his great-grandfather's powers initially caused chaos, he wished to be a hero, working alongside [[Kid Flash (Iris West)]].\n\nIn the first issue of the [[Infinite Crisis]] mini-series ''[[Villains United]]'', the Fiddler has joined the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. Disappointed by the Fiddler's performance against H.I.V.E. agents during their first mission, [[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]] deems him \"incompetent\" and orders him killed.

This version is a female version who is actually not a villain and a budding country music artist.\n\n==Publication history==\nFiddler first appeared in ''All-Flash'' #32 (December 1947/January 1948) and was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Lee Elias]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Fiddler's history was changed somewhat during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\n===Pre-Crisis===\nThe Fiddler started out as a thief who was arrested in [[India]] and sent to jail. While in prison, he met a [[fakir]], [[snake charming|charming a snake]] in his cell, who taught him the \"mystic art\" of Indian music. For the next five years, he learned the fakir's secret and made a crude [[violin]] made of material he could scrounge in the prison. He developed the ability to use his violin to play sounds that could either hypnotize others, shatter objects, or create barriers.<ref name=\"dc-ency-aw\">{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Crazy Creations | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=92 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> After the fakir declared his student had surpassed him, he used the instrument to hypnotize the guards to open their cells and he and the fakir escaped. He then murdered the fakir and the merchant who had him arrested in the first place.\n\nReturning to [[United States|America]], the Fiddler, as he called himself, made his first stop at [[Keystone City]]. While the Fiddler managed to humiliate the Flash ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]) the first time they met, Flash was able to foil his plan, which involved replacing Maestro Bowin, a violin virtuoso, who was actually the Fiddler's twin brother. The physical similarity between the brothers (who had been separated at birth) also led to Bowin briefly being suspected of the Fiddler's crimes. The Fiddler captured his brother and Flash, but they escaped and the Fiddler apparently committed suicide by diving into a river.  As is the case more often than not, the Fiddler survived his plunge into the river and returned to battle the Flash again a few months later.  The villain refined his appearance, shaving his dark locks and donning the powered white wig that became his trademark for the remainder of his life. After the Flash thwarts a petty theft and arrests most of his gang, the Fiddler followed the hero at a distance but was in time to piece together a quarrel between Flash and Joan Williams. The exchange, with Joan annoyed at the time Flash's life took him away from home, inspired the Fiddler to undermine the hero. Using local criminals, the Fiddler arranged for \"common citizens\" (really members of his gang) to demonstrate that the Flash was not needed. As the Flash arrived always just in time to see the \"citizens\" route the criminals, he was advised to rest, relax or take a vacation. Eventually, the tricks took their toll and the Flash announced his retirement. As soon as he had supposedly departed, the Fiddler instigated a reign of terror across Keystone, staging almost daily robberies. One evening, Joan was particularly regretful of her admonition of the Flash and took it upon herself to resolve the situation. Using mirrors to blur her form and give her the illusion of speed, she donned a spare uniform and took up pursuit of the Fiddler.

He uses several pseudonyms, most notably Benjamin Muon and algojo)(algojo.<ref>Pr\u00e9vost, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Le Navire Night, Text from the radio broadcasting of Benjamin Muon's 1999 concert, CBC radio, April 1999</ref>  His work has been associated with the development of [[performance art]], [[radio art]], [[process art]], [[sound poetry]] and [[experimental music]].<ref>Pelletier, Sonia, Bioskop codexcin\u00e9tique, un champ cin\u00e9tique exotique, in. Inter, \u00c9ditions Interventions, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, 1996</ref> Since the 1980s, L\u00e9tourneau has presented intermedia works in international performance art festivals, galleries and museums such as the Walter Phillips Gallery at the [[Banff Centre]] (1992), [[Jim Thompson (designer)|The James H.W. Thompson Foundation]] in [[Bangkok]] (one of [[Thailand]]'s National Museums directed under the Patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]], 2006) and at the [[Pointe-\u00e0-Calli\u00e8re Museum]] (as part of Les Escales Improbables in Montr\u00e9al, 2007). In 2006, he was one of the artists selected to represent Canada at the XVth [[Biennale de Paris]]  under a pseudonym.<ref>Catalogue de la XV\u00e8me Biennale de Paris, Editions Biennale de Paris, Paris, France, 2007</ref> Since 2012, L\u00e9tourneau has also contributed to the Biennale des Arts d'Afrique de l'est EASTAFAB-BURUNDI, the festival InterAzioni in Italy, the Steirischer Herbst (Graz, Austria), Festival Ph\u00e9nomena (Montr\u00e9al), Grace Exhibition Space and [[The Emily Harvey Foundation]] (New York) among many others.\n\nL\u00e9tourneau produced several radio art projects and music compositions for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC, Canada's national public radio and television broadcaster). In 1999, he was the producer for the CBC of the special H\u00f6rspiel broadcast from 10 to 12 PM on the night of December 31 for the passage to the new millennium.

He also regularly constructs his own instruments and custom-built electronics.\n\nHe qualifies most of his works as [[site-specific (disambiguation)|site-specific]] (pieces to be performed or installed in a precise place) but also \"time-specific\" (pieces to be performed at specific time of the day or of the year).<ref>Lander, Dan, A Selected survey or Radio Art in Canada 1967-1992, Walter Phillips Gallery, Banff Center for the Arts, 1992</ref> Since 1999, L\u00e9tourneau has also involved himself with music composition and interpretation and as the creator of custom-made instruments which are used in his work with the sound performance trio [[mineminemine]] along with intermedia artists [[Magali Babin]] and [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]]. The group regularly presents mineminemine's work in America and Europe.\n\nSince the mid-eighties, L\u00e9tourneau's also performed works from other experimental music composers such as [[Alvin Lucier]], [[John Cage]] and [[I Wayan Suweca]]. In 2000, he conducted a radio performance of the Symphony No. 5 by the Korean composer [[Nam June Paik]] for the CBC radio.\n\nAs a musician, he has collaborated with other composers including Sam Shalabi (Shalabi Effect), Roger Tellier Craig ([[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], Et Sans), [[Jo\u00eblle L\u00e9andre]], [[Jac Berrocal]], [[John Berndt]], [[Phill Niblock]], Alexander MacSween, [[Michel Smith]] (Orchestre V\u00e9lo Karel), [[Helena Espvall]], Jackie Blake, Dan Breen, Neil Wiernik (a.k.a. NAW) and [[R\u00e9jean Beaucage]].. He produced the score for the immersive film installation \"Rouge M\u00e9kong\" by Fran\u00e7ois-Lavoie Pilote, presented in Montreal at la [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des arts technologiques]] in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAs an executive producer for the CBC radio, CKUT-FM and wikiradio.uqam.ca, L\u00e9tourneau also produced concert recordings of musicians and performance artists such as [[Kathy Kennedy]], [[Anna Friz]], [[Richard H. Kirk]], [[Jean Dupuy (artist)|Jean Dupuy]], [[Thomas Buckner]], [[Johanne H\u00e9tu]], [[Brandon Labelle]], [[Christof Migone]], [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]],  [[Fred Frith]], [[Chris Cutler]], [[Serge Pey]], [[Sam Shalabi]], [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]], Roger Tellier-Craig and [[Joachim Montessuis]].\n\n==Art (manoeuvers, site-specific actions, contextual art and transmedia works)==\n\nAndr\u00e9 \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau's art manoeuvers work involves many media that are used simultaneously along with practices from other fields (such as science, sociology, psychology, community works, etc.). It may be difficult to categorize his work as much as of the practice by this artist involves operating directly within the social fabric while involving different social and ontological phenomena. L\u00e9tourneau works primarily with the creation of situations based on cultural and physical environmental processes. His actions are often structured so as to avoid the creation of objects or material products. These traces in reality are primarily works where the confusion between art and life emerges as the salient feature. While operating within different institutions, the works of L\u00e9tourneau often raise the concepts of power and consensus within the community.\n\nL\u00e9tourneau adapts his materials and methods of production according to the environmental requirements of each  project.<ref>Pelletier, Sonia,  Ondes fluides et points de forces, in. Inter #55, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, 1993</ref> For example, the use of correspondences, legal agreements, CD publishing and radio broadcasts in his 2005 piece \"Standard III\". L\u00e9tourneau also used other media such as integration of sign language and lip readings in various popular productions for television and Hollywood Cinema in \"Biblical Consequences of the Representations\" (2007\u20132010); photography, psychogeographic factors and individual conversations in \"Standard II\" (2001\u2013present); radioactive material process in a particle accelerator at the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]], aircraft and video in 1997's \"3 9 30,\";<ref>Martel, Richard, L'art en actes, \u00c9ditions Interventions, Qu\u00e9bec, 1998</ref> anagrams and floating custom built sound modules in \"Sonata for the Wolf\" from 2001. \"L\u00e9tourneau is calling upon the structures that have and do produce us, our notions of nationality and  belonging, and he is using the self same tools that gave rise to our present day status\".<ref>Spencer, Karen, Deflecting the Standard, in.

These works were presented in collaboration with different NGO's, community groups and human rights associations in Canada.\n\nSince October 2001, the artistic work of \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau has been centered around a series of meeting-maneuvers with citizens around the world. These maneuvers take place in the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Italy, Germany and France.\n\n==Collaborations==\n\nAndr\u00e9 \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau collaborated frequently with worked with many performance artists to create performances, video and installations, among them [[Jean Dupuy (artist)|Jean Dupuy]] (a French artist associated with the [[Fluxus]] group), [[John Berndt]], [[Christof Migone]],<ref>Gingras, Nicole  and Migone, Christof, Trou, Galerie de l'Uqam, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, 2006 ({{ISBN|2-920325-38-8}})</ref> [[Jocelyn Robert]], [[Beno\u00eet Fauteux]], [[Arahmaiani]], the Chinese performance artist [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and the Estonian group [[Non Grata]].\n\n===Mineminemine===\nMineminemine is an eclectic [[experimental music]] and [[performance art]] group he started along with [[Magali Babin]] and [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]].

At the opening of the XVe Biennale de Paris in 2008, it appointed director Mr Alexandre Gurita, declared about Letourneau's work : \"La d\u00e9marche d'Andr\u00e9 Eric Letourneau s'inscrit dans le spectre de l'invisibilit\u00e9 op\u00e9rante, qui constitue l'axe de l'\u00e9conomie de l'immat\u00e9riel et de la connaisance vers lesquelles nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9voluent.

He uses several pseudonyms, most notably Benjamin Muon and algojo)(algojo.<ref>Pr\u00e9vost, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Le Navire Night, Text from the radio broadcasting of Benjamin Muon's 1999 concert, CBC radio, April 1999</ref>  His work has been associated with the development of [[performance art]], [[radio art]], [[process art]], [[sound poetry]] and [[experimental music]].<ref>Pelletier, Sonia, Bioskop codexcin\u00e9tique, un champ cin\u00e9tique exotique, in. Inter, \u00c9ditions Interventions, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, 1996</ref> Since the 1980s, L\u00e9tourneau has presented intermedia works in international performance art festivals, galleries and museums such as the Walter Phillips Gallery at the [[Banff Centre]] (1992), [[Jim Thompson (designer)|The James H.W. Thompson Foundation]] in [[Bangkok]] (one of [[Thailand]]'s National Museums directed under the Patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]], 2006) and at the [[Pointe-\u00e0-Calli\u00e8re Museum]] (as part of Les Escales Improbables in Montr\u00e9al, 2007). In 2006, he was one of the artists selected to represent Canada at the XVth [[Biennale de Paris]]  under a pseudonym.<ref>Catalogue de la XV\u00e8me Biennale de Paris, Editions Biennale de Paris, Paris, France, 2007</ref> Since 2012, L\u00e9tourneau has also contributed to the Biennale des Arts d'Afrique de l'est EASTAFAB-BURUNDI, the festival InterAzioni in Italy, the Steirischer Herbst (Graz, Austria), Festival Ph\u00e9nomena (Montr\u00e9al), Grace Exhibition Space and [[The Emily Harvey Foundation]] (New York) among many others.\n\nL\u00e9tourneau produced several radio art projects and music compositions for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC, Canada's national public radio and television broadcaster). In 1999, he was the producer for the CBC of the special H\u00f6rspiel broadcast from 10 to 12 PM on the night of December 31 for the passage to the new millennium. Another H\u00f6rspeil, \"Standard III\" (2002), was commissioned by the CBC and broadcast on the night of Easter Sunday in 2003 under a program developed and curated by [[Mario Gauthier]] and [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pr\u00e9vost]].<ref>Gauthier, Mario, Standard III (ou un silence en cache-t-il un autre?), Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (Web site and Radio Program), Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 2002 (http://www.radio-canada.ca/radio/navire/texte-pdf/standard3.gauthier.pdf)</ref> He received several grants and awards including grants from the Artists and Community Collaboration Program (ACCP), the Inter-Arts Program of the [[Canada Council for the Arts]] and from the [[Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu\u00e9bec]] for his artistic and curatorial work.\n\n==Experimental music and radio-art==\n\nAs a music composer and radio artist, L\u00e9tourneau's works are influenced by the principle of [[indeterminacy in music]], [[chance music]], [[intuitive music]], [[noise music]], [[sound poetry]], [[text-sound composition]], [[spectral music]], non-standard use of musical instruments, traditional music from different cultures (especially [[Balinese gamelan]]), by the use of different systems of tuning involving the use of [[microtones]]  which incorporate [[electronics]] and [[extended techniques]]. He also regularly constructs his own instruments and custom-built electronics.\n\nHe qualifies most of his works as [[site-specific (disambiguation)|site-specific]] (pieces to be performed or installed in a precise place) but also \"time-specific\" (pieces to be performed at specific time of the day or of the year).<ref>Lander, Dan, A Selected survey or Radio Art in Canada 1967-1992, Walter Phillips Gallery, Banff Center for the Arts, 1992</ref> Since 1999, L\u00e9tourneau has also involved himself with music composition and interpretation and as the creator of custom-made instruments which are used in his work with the sound performance trio [[mineminemine]] along with intermedia artists [[Magali Babin]] and [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]]. The group regularly presents mineminemine's work in America and Europe.\n\nSince the mid-eighties, L\u00e9tourneau's also performed works from other experimental music composers such as [[Alvin Lucier]], [[John Cage]] and [[I Wayan Suweca]]. In 2000, he conducted a radio performance of the Symphony No. 5 by the Korean composer [[Nam June Paik]] for the CBC radio.\n\nAs a musician, he has collaborated with other composers including Sam Shalabi (Shalabi Effect), Roger Tellier Craig ([[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], Et Sans), [[Jo\u00eblle L\u00e9andre]], [[Jac Berrocal]], [[John Berndt]], [[Phill Niblock]], Alexander MacSween, [[Michel Smith]] (Orchestre V\u00e9lo Karel), [[Helena Espvall]], Jackie Blake, Dan Breen, Neil Wiernik (a.k.a. NAW) and [[R\u00e9jean Beaucage]].. He produced the score for the immersive film installation \"Rouge M\u00e9kong\" by Fran\u00e7ois-Lavoie Pilote, presented in Montreal at la [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des arts technologiques]] in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAs an executive producer for the CBC radio, CKUT-FM and wikiradio.uqam.ca, L\u00e9tourneau also produced concert recordings of musicians and performance artists such as [[Kathy Kennedy]], [[Anna Friz]], [[Richard H. Kirk]], [[Jean Dupuy (artist)|Jean Dupuy]], [[Thomas Buckner]], [[Johanne H\u00e9tu]], [[Brandon Labelle]], [[Christof Migone]], [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]],  [[Fred Frith]], [[Chris Cutler]], [[Serge Pey]], [[Sam Shalabi]], [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]], Roger Tellier-Craig and [[Joachim Montessuis]].\n\n==Art (manoeuvers, site-specific actions, contextual art and transmedia works)==\n\nAndr\u00e9 \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau's art manoeuvers work involves many media that are used simultaneously along with practices from other fields (such as science, sociology, psychology, community works, etc.). It may be difficult to categorize his work as much as of the practice by this artist involves operating directly within the social fabric while involving different social and ontological phenomena. L\u00e9tourneau works primarily with the creation of situations based on cultural and physical environmental processes. His actions are often structured so as to avoid the creation of objects or material products. These traces in reality are primarily works where the confusion between art and life emerges as the salient feature. While operating within different institutions, the works of L\u00e9tourneau often raise the concepts of power and consensus within the community.\n\nL\u00e9tourneau adapts his materials and methods of production according to the environmental requirements of each  project.<ref>Pelletier, Sonia,  Ondes fluides et points de forces, in. Inter #55, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, 1993</ref> For example, the use of correspondences, legal agreements, CD publishing and radio broadcasts in his 2005 piece \"Standard III\". L\u00e9tourneau also used other media such as integration of sign language and lip readings in various popular productions for television and Hollywood Cinema in \"Biblical Consequences of the Representations\" (2007\u20132010); photography, psychogeographic factors and individual conversations in \"Standard II\" (2001\u2013present); radioactive material process in a particle accelerator at the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]], aircraft and video in 1997's \"3 9 30,\";<ref>Martel, Richard, L'art en actes, \u00c9ditions Interventions, Qu\u00e9bec, 1998</ref> anagrams and floating custom built sound modules in \"Sonata for the Wolf\" from 2001. \"L\u00e9tourneau is calling upon the structures that have and do produce us, our notions of nationality and  belonging, and he is using the self same tools that gave rise to our present day status\".<ref>Spencer, Karen, Deflecting the Standard, in.

These works were presented in collaboration with different NGO's, community groups and human rights associations in Canada.\n\nSince October 2001, the artistic work of \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau has been centered around a series of meeting-maneuvers with citizens around the world. These maneuvers take place in the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Italy, Germany and France.\n\n==Collaborations==\n\nAndr\u00e9 \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau collaborated frequently with worked with many performance artists to create performances, video and installations, among them [[Jean Dupuy (artist)|Jean Dupuy]] (a French artist associated with the [[Fluxus]] group), [[John Berndt]], [[Christof Migone]],<ref>Gingras, Nicole  and Migone, Christof, Trou, Galerie de l'Uqam, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, 2006 ({{ISBN|2-920325-38-8}})</ref> [[Jocelyn Robert]], [[Beno\u00eet Fauteux]], [[Arahmaiani]], the Chinese performance artist [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and the Estonian group [[Non Grata]].\n\n===Mineminemine===\nMineminemine is an eclectic [[experimental music]] and [[performance art]] group he started along with [[Magali Babin]] and [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]].

At the opening of the XVe Biennale de Paris in 2008, it appointed director Mr Alexandre Gurita, declared about Letourneau's work : \"La d\u00e9marche d'Andr\u00e9 Eric Letourneau s'inscrit dans le spectre de l'invisibilit\u00e9 op\u00e9rante, qui constitue l'axe de l'\u00e9conomie de l'immat\u00e9riel et de la connaisance vers lesquelles nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9voluent.
