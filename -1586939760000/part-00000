Between the summers of 2007 and 2009 he spent season-long loans with German lower-tier clubs [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] and [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena]]. After a blighted six months with [[SK Austria K\u00e4rnten|Austria K\u00e4rnten]], he joined Hungarian side [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] where he established himself as first choice ending the season as the club's top scorer with 17 goals in all competitions.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Schembri joined [[Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C.|Olympiacos Volou]] however after a few games the club was demoted to the fourth-tier of Greek football following a [[Koriopolis|match-fixing scandal]]. As a result, Schembri joined [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]]. After completing the [[2011\u201312 Superleague Greece|2011\u201312]] season, Schembri was signed by Cypriot club [[AC Omonia|Omonia]]. With them he slowly established himself in the forward line finishing his second season as the league's second highest goalscorer with 17 goals. After a short stint with German club [[FSV Frankfurt]], he returned to Omonia in December 2014.\n\nWith interest from foreign clubs, Portuguese side [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] signed Schembri. Although initially making the first eleven, the arrival of a new manager midway through the season led to him being dropped to a substitute role. With lack of opportunities, Schembri returned to Cyprus, joining Apollon Limassol in the summer of 2017. He quickly became a prominent figure, scoring four goals in six qualifying matches as he helped the club make it through to the group stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. In this same competition he also became the first Maltese to score in the proper rounds of a UEFA competition.

Between the summers of 2007 and 2009 he spent season-long loans with German lower-tier clubs [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] and [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena]]. After a blighted six months with [[SK Austria K\u00e4rnten|Austria K\u00e4rnten]], he joined Hungarian side [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] where he established himself as first choice ending the season as the club's top scorer with 17 goals in all competitions.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Schembri joined [[Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C.|Olympiacos Volou]] however after a few games the club was demoted to the fourth-tier of Greek football following a [[Koriopolis|match-fixing scandal]]. As a result, Schembri joined [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]]. After completing the [[2011\u201312 Superleague Greece|2011\u201312]] season, Schembri was signed by Cypriot club [[AC Omonia|Omonia]]. With them he slowly established himself in the forward line finishing his second season as the league's second highest goalscorer with 17 goals. After a short stint with German club [[FSV Frankfurt]], he returned to Omonia in December 2014.\n\nWith interest from foreign clubs, Portuguese side [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] signed Schembri. Although initially making the first eleven, the arrival of a new manager midway through the season led to him being dropped to a substitute role. With lack of opportunities, Schembri returned to Cyprus, joining Apollon Limassol in the summer of 2017. He quickly became a prominent figure, scoring four goals in six qualifying matches as he helped the club make it through to the group stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. In this same competition he also became the first Maltese to score in the proper rounds of a UEFA competition. In August 2017, he won his first trophy outside his home country as Apollon Limassol triumphed in the [[Cypriot Super Cup]], with Schembri also scoring the winning goal.\n\nAt the international level, he represented Malta at youth levels, before making his senior debut on 4 June 2006 against [[Japan national football team|Japan]].

The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server<ref>\n   {{cite web\n     | url = http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12530_01/oam.1014/e10356.pdf\n     | title = Oracle\u00ae Access Manager Integration Guide\n     | publisher = [[Oracle Corporation]]\n     | date = August 2007\n     | quote = [...] the RSA ACE/Server\u00ae, which has been renamed to the Authentication Manager.\n   }}\n</ref>) as the tokens are purchased.<ref name=\"totp\">[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-00 TOTP: Time-based One-time Password Algorithm]</ref> On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.\n\nThe token hardware is designed to be [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] to deter [[reverse engineering]]. When software implementations of the same algorithm (\"software tokens\") appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server.<ref>[http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2000/Dec/459 Sample SecurID Token Emulator with Token Secret Import]</ref> Later, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library.<ref>[http://stoken.sf.net/ stoken - Software Token for Linux/UNIX]</ref> In the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate [[one-time password]]s. <!-- Previously this article has OTP capitalized (using a piped Wikilink), for no good reason. That would make \"OTP\" a proper noun, which in this context it is not. Just because something has an acronym does not mean its expansion should be capitalized. --> Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a [[smart card]]-like device for securely storing [[Public key certificate|certificates]].<ref>[http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/datasheets/9651_SID800_DS_0908-lowres.pdf RSA SecurID SID800 Hardware Authenticator] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113005859/http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/datasheets/9651_SID800_DS_0908-lowres.pdf |date=November 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA user authenticating to a network resource\u2014say, a dial-in server or a firewall\u2014needs to enter both a [[personal identification number]] and the number being displayed ''at that moment'' on their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered.\n\nOn older versions of SecurID, a \"duress PIN\" may be used\u2014an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.process.com/tcpip/tcpware57docs/User_Guide/ch14.htm#E53E27 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071802/http://www.process.com/tcpip/tcpware57docs/User_Guide/ch14.htm#E53E27#E53E27 |archive-date=2012-03-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Using the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The \"duress PIN\" feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.\n\nWhile the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server's clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored \"drift\" value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.\n\nRSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called \"Ubiquitous Authentication\", partnering with device manufacturers such as [[IronKey]], [[SanDisk]], [[Motorola]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]], Redcannon, [[Broadcom]], and [[BlackBerry]] to embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-142107014.html RSA Security to enable ubiquitous authentication as RSA SecurID(r) technology reaches everyday devices and software;. - M2 Presswire | HighBeam Research: Online Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical vulnerabilities ==\n\nToken codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code).  This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.\n\nThe simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional [[electronic leash]] or body sensor and alarm.\n\nWhile RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password [[replay attack]]s, they are not designed to offer protection against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]] type attacks when used alone.  If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent [[Man in the Browser|man in the browser]] (MitB) based attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Multiple_Factors_Authentication_(OWASP-AT-009) |title=Testing Multiple Factors Authentication (OWASP-AT-009)}}</ref>\n\nSecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard.<ref>http://malpaso.ru/securid/brainard.htm</ref> If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].\n\nAlthough soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations,<ref>http://securology.blogspot.com/2007/11/soft-tokens-arent-tokens-at-all.html</ref> which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.\n\nHard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known.

Security and now [[RSA (security firm)|RSA, The Security Division of EMC]]) for performing [[two-factor authentication]] for a user to a network resource.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:RSA SecurID Token Old.jpg|thumbnail|RSA SecurID token (older style, model SD600)]]\n[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumbnail|RSA SecurID token (model SID700)]]\n[[File:RSA SecurID SID800.jpg|thumbnail|RSA SecurID (new style, SID800 model with smartcard functionality)]]\n\nThe RSA SecurID authentication mechanism consists of a \"[[security token|token]]\" \u2014 either hardware (e.g. a [[key fob]]) or software (a [[software token|soft token]]) \u2014 which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in clock and the card's factory-encoded almost random [[Key (cryptography)|key]] (known as the \"seed\"). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server<ref>\n   {{cite web\n     | url = http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12530_01/oam.1014/e10356.pdf\n     | title = Oracle\u00ae Access Manager Integration Guide\n     | publisher = [[Oracle Corporation]]\n     | date = August 2007\n     | quote = [...] the RSA ACE/Server\u00ae, which has been renamed to the Authentication Manager.\n   }}\n</ref>) as the tokens are purchased.<ref name=\"totp\">[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-00 TOTP: Time-based One-time Password Algorithm]</ref> On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.\n\nThe token hardware is designed to be [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] to deter [[reverse engineering]]. When software implementations of the same algorithm (\"software tokens\") appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server.<ref>[http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2000/Dec/459 Sample SecurID Token Emulator with Token Secret Import]</ref> Later, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library.<ref>[http://stoken.sf.net/ stoken - Software Token for Linux/UNIX]</ref> In the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate [[one-time password]]s. <!-- Previously this article has OTP capitalized (using a piped Wikilink), for no good reason. That would make \"OTP\" a proper noun, which in this context it is not. Just because something has an acronym does not mean its expansion should be capitalized. --> Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a [[smart card]]-like device for securely storing [[Public key certificate|certificates]].<ref>[http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/datasheets/9651_SID800_DS_0908-lowres.pdf RSA SecurID SID800 Hardware Authenticator] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113005859/http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/datasheets/9651_SID800_DS_0908-lowres.pdf |date=November 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA user authenticating to a network resource\u2014say, a dial-in server or a firewall\u2014needs to enter both a [[personal identification number]] and the number being displayed ''at that moment'' on their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered.\n\nOn older versions of SecurID, a \"duress PIN\" may be used\u2014an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.process.com/tcpip/tcpware57docs/User_Guide/ch14.htm#E53E27 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071802/http://www.process.com/tcpip/tcpware57docs/User_Guide/ch14.htm#E53E27#E53E27 |archive-date=2012-03-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Using the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The \"duress PIN\" feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.\n\nWhile the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server's clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored \"drift\" value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.\n\nRSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called \"Ubiquitous Authentication\", partnering with device manufacturers such as [[IronKey]], [[SanDisk]], [[Motorola]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]], Redcannon, [[Broadcom]], and [[BlackBerry]] to embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-142107014.html RSA Security to enable ubiquitous authentication as RSA SecurID(r) technology reaches everyday devices and software;. - M2 Presswire | HighBeam Research: Online Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical vulnerabilities ==\n\nToken codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code).  This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.\n\nThe simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional [[electronic leash]] or body sensor and alarm.\n\nWhile RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password [[replay attack]]s, they are not designed to offer protection against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]] type attacks when used alone.  If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent [[Man in the Browser|man in the browser]] (MitB) based attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Multiple_Factors_Authentication_(OWASP-AT-009) |title=Testing Multiple Factors Authentication (OWASP-AT-009)}}</ref>\n\nSecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard.<ref>http://malpaso.ru/securid/brainard.htm</ref> If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].\n\nAlthough soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations,<ref>http://securology.blogspot.com/2007/11/soft-tokens-arent-tokens-at-all.html</ref> which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.\n\nHard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.\n\nBatteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.\n\n== Reception and competing products ==\nAs of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.com/press_release.aspx?id=5028 |title=RSA SecurID Solution Named Best Third-Party Authentication Device by Windows IT Pro Magazine Readers\u2019 Choice 2004 |work=RSA.com |date=2004-09-16 |accessdate=2011-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106232859/http://rsa.com/press_release.aspx?id=5028 |archivedate=2010-01-06 }}</ref> and 25 million devices have been produced to date.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A number of competitors, such as [[VASCO Data Security International, Inc.|VASCO]], make similar [[security token]]s, mostly based on the open [[Initiative For Open Authentication|OATH HOTP]] standard.

In the first [[Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|Commonplace Book]] written at [[Ellisland Farm]] he deleted ''virtue'' in the first stanza and substituted it with ''honor'' and wrote that: \"''Lest my works should be thought below criticism; or meet with a Critic who, perhaps, will not look on them with so candid and favorable an eye; I am determined to criticise them myself.''\"\n\n===First stanza===\nThe first line is ''quite too much in the flimsy strain of ordinary street ballads; and on the other hand, the second line ''is too much in the other extreme. The expression is a little awkward, and the sentiment too serious.''\n\n===Second stanza===\nBurns wrote that ''..I am well pleased with; and I think it conveys a fine idea of that amiable part of the sex --- the agreables; or what in our Scotch dialect we call a sweet sonsy lass''.\n\n===Third stanza===\nBurns wrote that it ''has a little of the flimsy turn in it; and the third line has rather too serious a cast''.\n\n===Fourth stanza===\nBurns wrote that this is ''a very indifferent one; the first line is, indeed all in the strain of the second stanza, but the rest is mostly an expletive''. \n\n===Fifth stanza===\nBurns wrote that ''The thoughts in the fifth stanza come finely up to my favourite idea of a sweet sonsy lass; the last line halts a little''.\n\n===Sixth stanza===\nBurns wrote that ''The same sentiments are kept up with equal spirit and tenderness''. '..but the second and fourth lines ending with short syllables hurt the whole''.\n\n===Seventh stanza===\nBurns wrote that it has ''several minute faults; but I remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to this hour I never recollect it, but my heart melts, and my blood sallies at the rememberance''.\u00b7\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n# Annandale, Charles (Editor) (1890).

Haribo makes [[Pontefract Cakes]] at their factory in [[Pontefract]], [[West Yorkshire]], and other locations.\n\n==US presence==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n\nHaribo had been imported into the [[United States]] for many years{{When|date=May 2017}} by German food importers and sold at German and other gourmet stores at \"gourmet prices\", mostly in bulk. In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mass market candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through areas such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match U.S. candy price points and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters. \n\nOnce this was done and Haribo products in US-style packaging were introduced at confectionery and fancy food shows, Haribo became a popular item. Sales soared the first year, and gummy bears became so popular in the US, Haribo in Germany could not supply enough products, so the US market was soon flooded with competitors such as German [[Trolli]] and American [[Black Forest Gummy Bears|Black Forest]].\n\nOn 23 March 2017, Haribo announced they will be opening their first United States factory, a 500,000 sq ft (46,500 m\u00b2), 400 employee manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, scheduled to open in 2020.\nHaribo products made in the US regularly have [[corn syrup]] and artificial flavors and colors. Production with artificial ingredients is cheaper, however, and the U.S. operation is poised to profit from this lower cost.\n\n==International distribution==\n[[File:Haribo Normanton Distribution.jpg|New Haribo factory and distribution centre located in Castleford, West Yorkshire, UK.|thumb]]\nHaribo plans to expand to China and Brazil.

The German advertisements were voiced by [[Thomas Gottschalk]] from 1991 until 2015. In English-speaking countries, it uses the slogan \"Kids and grown-ups love it so \u2013 the happy world of Haribo\". In [[Hungary]], it uses the slogan \"''Gyermek, feln\u0151tt kedve j\u00f3 \u2013 \u00e9des \u00e9let, Haribo''\" (\"Child and adult is happy \u2013 sweet life, Haribo\"). \"''Haribo c'est beau la vie, pour les grands et les petits''\" (\"Haribo life is beautiful, for big ones and little ones\") is used in [[France]], while in [[Italy]] the song used during commercials is: \"''Haribo \u00e8 la bont\u00e0, che si gusta ad ogni et\u00e0''\" (\"Haribo is the delicacy that one can taste at any age\").

In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mass market candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through areas such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match U.S. candy price points and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters. \n\nOnce this was done and Haribo products in US-style packaging were introduced at confectionery and fancy food shows, Haribo became a popular item. Sales soared the first year, and gummy bears became so popular in the US, Haribo in Germany could not supply enough products, so the US market was soon flooded with competitors such as German [[Trolli]] and American [[Black Forest Gummy Bears|Black Forest]].\n\nOn 23 March 2017, Haribo announced they will be opening their first United States factory, a 500,000 sq ft (46,500 m\u00b2), 400 employee manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, scheduled to open in 2020.\nHaribo products made in the US regularly have [[corn syrup]] and artificial flavors and colors. Production with artificial ingredients is cheaper, however, and the U.S. operation is poised to profit from this lower cost.\n\n==International distribution==\n[[File:Haribo Normanton Distribution.jpg|New Haribo factory and distribution centre located in Castleford, West Yorkshire, UK.|thumb]]\nHaribo plans to expand to China and Brazil.

Joppan is an adept Kabbadi player, and during an informal victory parade, he falls for Annie's ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]) beauty. Annie, an estate supervisor's daughter, does not initially reciprocate Joppan's feelings, but Joppan attains her love by saving her younger brother's life. Their love becomes the talk of the town and Joppan's father reprimands him. Joppan renounces his family and locals, except Annie, and assures her that he will return for her after becoming an affluent man.\n\nIn the course of time, Annie grows into a woman. Abruptly, Annie's father dies and Annie is taken to Mettupalayam by her kindred. Joppan returns to town and meets his friends. The [[Mercedes-Benz]] and the cash case are the proof of his affluent status. He asks for Annie and helplessly witnesses her marriage. Broken, he finds relief in alcohol. The friends finish the flashback and take a final dip in the lake.\n\nJoppan brings back his Kabbadi team and wins many trophies. Joppan and his friends pass the time by watching ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' and drinking. The vicar, a marriage broker, Joppan's mother and friends compel him to seek a bride. He at last consents but sees a girl with modern views. Later on in the parish, amidst a downpour, Maria ([[Mamta Mohandas]]) sneaks into Joppan's umbrella and later witnesses his street duel with a law enforcement officer. Joppan and Maria then coincidentally meet each other in different ways. Joppan discovers qualities of Annie in Maria and falls for her. However, Joppan ends up helping her to elope with Thomaskutty. His friends and family believe that Joppan has married Maria, but when they acknowledge the truth, his desperate mother implores him to attend a retreat. Thus, Joppan and his friends go to a retreat centre. There, Joppan happens to meet Annie, but later discovers that she is with her fianc\u00e9, a physically challenged person. After attending Annie's marriage, Joppan angrily comes home, but is met with his mother's order to again visit a potential bride. Reluctantly, Joppan, the broker and his friends go to the girl's home and learns that the girl is Maria. She reveals that Thomaskutty was spineless and cowardly, unlike Joppan, and has left her in the lurch. In the climax Joppan and Maria get married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Thoppil Joppan\n* [[Mamta Mohandas]] as Dr. Maria\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Annie, Joppan's former lover\n* [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Marykutty, Joppan's mother\n* [[Renji Panicker]] as Fr.

Joppan is an adept Kabbadi player, and during an informal victory parade, he falls for Annie's ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]) beauty. Annie, an estate supervisor's daughter, does not initially reciprocate Joppan's feelings, but Joppan attains her love by saving her younger brother's life. Their love becomes the talk of the town and Joppan's father reprimands him. Joppan renounces his family and locals, except Annie, and assures her that he will return for her after becoming an affluent man.\n\nIn the course of time, Annie grows into a woman. Abruptly, Annie's father dies and Annie is taken to Mettupalayam by her kindred. Joppan returns to town and meets his friends. The [[Mercedes-Benz]] and the cash case are the proof of his affluent status. He asks for Annie and helplessly witnesses her marriage. Broken, he finds relief in alcohol. The friends finish the flashback and take a final dip in the lake.\n\nJoppan brings back his Kabbadi team and wins many trophies. Joppan and his friends pass the time by watching ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' and drinking. The vicar, a marriage broker, Joppan's mother and friends compel him to seek a bride. He at last consents but sees a girl with modern views. Later on in the parish, amidst a downpour, Maria ([[Mamta Mohandas]]) sneaks into Joppan's umbrella and later witnesses his street duel with a law enforcement officer. Joppan and Maria then coincidentally meet each other in different ways. Joppan discovers qualities of Annie in Maria and falls for her. However, Joppan ends up helping her to elope with Thomaskutty. His friends and family believe that Joppan has married Maria, but when they acknowledge the truth, his desperate mother implores him to attend a retreat. Thus, Joppan and his friends go to a retreat centre. There, Joppan happens to meet Annie, but later discovers that she is with her fianc\u00e9, a physically challenged person. After attending Annie's marriage, Joppan angrily comes home, but is met with his mother's order to again visit a potential bride. Reluctantly, Joppan, the broker and his friends go to the girl's home and learns that the girl is Maria. She reveals that Thomaskutty was spineless and cowardly, unlike Joppan, and has left her in the lurch. In the climax Joppan and Maria get married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Thoppil Joppan\n* [[Mamta Mohandas]] as Dr. Maria\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Annie, Joppan's former lover\n* [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Marykutty, Joppan's mother\n* [[Renji Panicker]] as Fr.
