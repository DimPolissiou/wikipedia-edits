The Deputy Premiership has been a ministerial portfolio since 1932, and the Deputy Premier is appointed by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] on the advice of the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]].\n\nThe current Deputy Premier is the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 NSW|National Party]]'s [[John Barilaro]], who was sworn in on 15 November 2016.\n\n==History==\nThe office of Deputy Premier was created in May 1932 for [[Michael Bruxner]], the leader of the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 NSW|Country Party]] (later renamed the National Party). Prior to that time the term was sometimes used unofficially (without capital letters) for the second-highest ranking minister in the government.\n\nIn [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] governments, the Deputy Premier is the party's deputy leader. Generally speaking, this person has come from the left faction of the party whereas the Premier has come from the right faction. In [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal]]-National [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] governments, the position has been held by the Leader of the National Party or its predecessors.\n\nThree Deputy Premiers have subsequently become Premier in their own right: [[Joseph Cahill]], [[Robert Heffron]], and [[Jack Renshaw]]. However, this has not occurred since 1964.\n\n==Duties==\nThe duties of the Deputy Premier are to act on behalf of the Premier in his or her absence overseas or on leave. The Deputy Premier has always been a member of the [[New South Wales Ministry|Cabinet]], and has always held at least one substantive portfolio (It would be technically possible for a minister to hold only the portfolio of Deputy Premier, but this has never happened).\n\nIf the Premier were to die, become incapacitated or resign, the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] would normally appoint the Deputy Premier as Premier.  If the governing or majority party had not yet elected a new leader, that appointment would be on an interim basis.  Should a different leader emerge, that person would then be appointed Premier.\n\n==List of Deputy Premiers of New South Wales==\n; Political parties\n{{legend2|{{National Party of Australia/meta/color}}|[[National Party of Australia|Country/National]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Australian Labor Party/meta/color}}|[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2\n|-\n! colspan=2|No.\n!

At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as [[Centrism|centrists]], occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party.\n\nThe party was formally deregistered in 2016 for not having the required 500 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/democrats.htm|title=The Australian Democrats|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the Australian Democrats merged with [[CountryMinded|Country Minded]], an Australian political party seeking accountable regional and agricultural representation.<ref name=chan>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/11/alex-turnbull-would-fund-moderate-independents-to-fight-abbott-and-joyce|title=Alex Turnbull would fund moderate independents to fight Abbott and Joyce|last=Chan|first=Gabrielle|date=2018-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref> \nOn 7 April 2019 the merged entity regained registration of the name \"Australian Democrats\" with the Australian Electoral Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/index.htm|title=Party registration decisions and changes|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref> The party unsuccessfully contested the lower-house seat of Adelaide and a total of six Senate seats (two in each state of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia)<ref>[https://www.australian-democrats.org.au/our-candidates/ Our candidates].

Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' of the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election|Franklin River Dam]].\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1977\u20131986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===\nThe Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties.

In 1980, this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the re-election of Janine Haines (SA). Thereafter they frequently held enough seats to give them the balance of power in the upper chamber.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-Democrats|title=Australian Democrats {{!}} political party, Australia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt a Melbourne media conference on 19 September 1980, in the midst of the [[1980 Australian federal election|1980 election campaign]], Chipp described his party's aim as to \"keep the bastards honest\"\u2014the \"bastards\" being the major parties and/or politicians in general.

Millhouse held his seat ([[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]]) at the [[1977 South Australian state election|1977]] and [[1979 South Australian state election|1979]] state elections. In 1982, Millhouse resigned to take up a senior judicial appointment, and [[Heather Southcott]] won the [[1982 Mitcham state by-election|by-election]] for the Democrats, but lost the seat to the Liberals later that year at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower-house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.\n\n===1986\u20131990: Janine Haines' leadership===\n[[File:HainesChipp.jpg|thumb|[[Janine Haines]] and [[Don Chipp]], the first two leaders of the Australian Democrats]]\nDon Chipp resigned from the Senate on 18 August 1986, being succeeded as party leader by Janine Haines and replaced as a senator for Victoria by [[Janet Powell]].\n\nAt the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 election]] following a [[double dissolution]], the reduced [[Australian Senate#Voting system|quota]] of 7.7% necessary to win a seat assisted the election of three new senators. 6-year terms were won by [[Paul McLean (politician)|Paul McLean]] (NSW) and incumbents Janine Haines (South Australia) and Janet Powell (Victoria). In South Australia, a second senator, [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]], was elected for a 3-year term, as were incumbent Michael Macklin (Queensland) and [[Jean Jenkins (politician)|Jean Jenkins]] (Western Australia).\n1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of Janine Haines (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat of [[Division of Kingston|Kingston]].\n\nThe casual vacancy was filled by [[Meg Lees]] several months before the election of [[Cheryl Kernot]] in place of retired deputy leader Michael Macklin. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the party's national parliamentary deputy leadership.

At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as [[Centrism|centrists]], occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party.\n\nThe party was formally deregistered in 2016 for not having the required 500 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/democrats.htm|title=The Australian Democrats|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the Australian Democrats merged with [[CountryMinded|Country Minded]], an Australian political party seeking accountable regional and agricultural representation.<ref name=chan>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/11/alex-turnbull-would-fund-moderate-independents-to-fight-abbott-and-joyce|title=Alex Turnbull would fund moderate independents to fight Abbott and Joyce|last=Chan|first=Gabrielle|date=2018-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref> \nOn 7 April 2019 the merged entity regained registration of the name \"Australian Democrats\" with the Australian Electoral Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/index.htm|title=Party registration decisions and changes|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref> The party unsuccessfully contested the lower-house seat of Adelaide and a total of six Senate seats (two in each state of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia)<ref>[https://www.australian-democrats.org.au/our-candidates/ Our candidates].

Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' of the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election|Franklin River Dam]].\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1977\u20131986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===\nThe Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties.

In 1980, this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the re-election of Janine Haines (SA).

{"title_page": "X display manager", "text_new": "{{for|the program called \"X Display Manager\"|XDM (display manager)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n{{primary sources|date=August 2008}}\n}}\n\nIn the [[X Window System]], '''X display manager''' is a graphical [[login manager]] which starts a [[login session]] on an [[X Window System|X server]] from the same or another [[computer]].\n\n[[Image:Screenshot of the KDE Display Manager.jpg|thumb|350px|A login screen shown by the [[KDE Display Manager|KDM]] display manager.]]\n\nA display manager presents the user with a [[login|login screen]]. A session starts when a user successfully enters a valid combination of [[username]] and [[password]].\n\nWhen the display manager runs on the user's computer, it starts the X server before presenting the user the login screen, optionally repeating when the user logs out. In this condition, the DM realizes in the X Window System the functionality of <tt>[[getty (Unix)|getty]]</tt> and <tt>login</tt> on [[computer terminal|character-mode terminals]]. When the display manager runs on a remote computer, it acts like a [[telnet]] server, requesting username and password and starting a remote session.\n\nX11 Release 3 introduced display managers in October 1988 with the aim of supporting the standalone [[X terminal]]s, just coming onto the market. Various display managers continue in routine use to provide a graphical login prompt on standalone [[computer workstation]]s running X. X11R4 introduced the '''X Display Manager Control Protocol''' ('''XDMCP''') in December 1989 to fix problems in the X11R3 implementation.\n\n== History==\n[[XDM (display manager)|XDM]] (the X Window Display Manager) originated in X11R3. This first version, written by [[Keith Packard]] of the MIT X Consortium, had several limitations, the most notable of which was that it could not detect when users switched X terminals off and on. In X11R3, XDM only knew about an X terminal from its entry in the <tt>Xservers</tt> file, but XDM only consulted this file when it started. Thus every time a user switched a terminal off and on, the [[system administrator]] had to send a [[SIGHUP]] [[signal (computing)|signal]] to XDM to instruct it to rescan <tt>Xservers</tt>.\n\nXDMCP arrived with the introduction of X11R4 (December 1989). With XDMCP, the X server must actively request a display manager connection from the host. An X server using XDMCP therefore no longer requires an entry in <tt>Xservers</tt>.\n\n==Local and remote display management==\nA display manager can run on the same computer where the user sits\u2014starting one or more X servers, displaying the login screen at the beginning and (optionally) every time the user logs out\u2014or on a remote one, working according to the XDMCP protocol.\n\n[[Image:Xserver and display manager.svg|thumb|400px|In the X Window System, the '''X server''' runs on the computer in front of the user. The X server may connect to a '''display manager''' running on another computer, starting a session which may comprise a variety of programs running on that other computer.]]\n\nThe XDMCP protocol mandates that the X server starts autonomously and connects to the display manager. In the X Window System paradigm, the server runs on the computer providing the display and input devices. A server can connect, using the XDMCP protocol, to a display manager running on another computer, requesting it to start the session. In this case, the X server acts as a graphical [[telnet]] client while the display manager acts like a telnet server: users start programs from the computer running the display manager, while their input and output take place on the computer where the server (and the user) sits.\n\nAn administrator can typically configure an '''XDMCP Chooser''' program running on the local computer or X terminal to connect to a specific host's X display manager or to display a list of suitable hosts that the user can choose from. Most implementations enable such a list to contain:\n# a predefined set of hosts and their respective network addresses, and/or\n# a set of hosts (on the local [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[subnetwork|subnet]]) that the XDMCP Chooser determines by a [[broadcast domain|network broadcast]] to the available display managers.\n\nWhen the user selects a host from the list, the XDMCP Chooser running on the local machine will send a message to the selected remote computer's display manager and instruct it to connect the X server on the local computer or terminal.\n\n==X Display Manager Control Protocol==\n{{anchor|XDMCP}}\nThe X Display Manager Control Protocol uses [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 177. An X server requests that a display manager start a session by sending a <code>Query</code> packet. If the display manager allows access for that X server, it responds by sending a <code>Willing</code> packet back to the X server. (The X server can also send <code>BroadcastQuery</code> or <code>IndirectQuery</code> packets to start a session - this mechanism for requesting a session resembles using [[DHCP]] to request an IP address.)\n\nThe display manager must authenticate itself to the server. To do this the X server sends a <code>Request</code> packet to the display manager, which returns an <code>Accept</code> packet. If the <code>Accept</code> packet contains the response the X server expects, the display manager is authenticated. Producing the correct response might require the display manager to have access to a [[secret key]], for example. If authentication succeeds, the X server sends a <code>Manage</code> packet to inform the display manager. Then the display manager displays its login screen by connecting to the X server as a regular X client.\n\nDuring the session, the server can send <code>KeepAlive</code> packets to the display manager at intervals. If the display manager fails to respond with an <code>Alive</code> packet within a certain time, the X server presumes that the display manager has ceased running, and can terminate the connection.\n<!-- missing: 1. when is the connection terminated 2. more on indirect and broadcast -->\n\nOne problem with XDMCP is that, similarly to [[telnet]], the authentication takes place unencrypted. If snooping is possible, this leaves the system vulnerable to attack. It is more secure to use an [[Secure Shell|ssh]] [[tunneling protocol|tunnel]] for X traffic.<ref>http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/docs/2.14/security.html</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\nThe [[X Window System]] supplies [[X Display Manager (implementation)|XDM]] as its standard display manager.\n\nProgrammers have developed other X display managers, both commercial and free, offering additional functionality over the basic display management:\n\n===Active===\n* [[SDDM]], the successor of the KDM, written in [[C++11]], theming via [[QML]]\n* [[GNOME Display Manager|GDM]] (part of [[GNOME]])\n* [[LightDM]], a lightweight, modular, cross-desktop, fully themeable desktop display manager by [[Canonical Ltd.]]\n\n===Inactive===\n* [[KDE Display Manager|KDM]] (part of [[KDE]]) allows the user to graphically select a [[X window manager|window manager]] or [[desktop environment]] in the login screen\n* [http://qingy.sourceforge.net/ Qingy] ultralight and very configurable graphical login independent on X Window (uses [[DirectFB]]) \n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdm-options/ XDM-OPTIONS] for XDM.
