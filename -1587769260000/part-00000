He also wrote ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|The History of Java]]'' (1817).\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Stamford Bingley Raffles was born on 5 July 1781 on board the ship ''Ann'' off the coast of [[Port Morant]], [[Jamaica]]{{r|Sophia Raffles}}, to Captain Benjamin Raffles (1739, London \u2013 23 November 1811, Deptford) and Anne Raffles (n\u00e9e Lyde) (1755 \u2013 8 February 1824, London).{{r|Bastin}} His father was a {{citation needed span|text=[[Yorkshire]]man|date=July 2018}} who had a burgeoning family{{r|Bastin}} and {{citation needed span|text=little luck in the West Indies trade during the [[American Revolution]], sending the family into debt.|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe little money the family had went into sending Raffles to boarding school. In 1795, at the age of 14, Raffles started working as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] in London for the [[British East India Company]], the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. Nine years later, in 1804, the 23-year-old Raffles married [[Olivia Mariamne Devenish]], a widow 10 years his senior{{r|\"Bastin\"|pages=57, 73, 107}}, who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800.{{r|\"Bastin\"|pages=59, 69}}\n\nIn 1805, he was sent to [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], starting his long association with [[Southeast Asia]]. He started with a post, as assistant secretary, under the Honourable [[Philip Dundas]], the new Governor of Penang.<ref name=\"BritMus\" /> At this time he also made the acquaintance of [[Thomas Otho Travers]], who would accompany him for the next twenty years.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Java==\n===British invasion of Java===\nHis knowledge of the [[Malay language]], as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, Baron Minto|Lord Minto]], the then [[Governor-General of India]], and he was sent to [[Malacca]].\n\nIn 1811, after the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted [[Invasion of Java (1811)|a military expedition]] against the Dutch and French in [[Java]], in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The war was swiftly conducted by Admiral [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]], General [[Frederick Augustus Wetherall]], and Colonel [[Robert Rollo Gillespie]], who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership.\n\nThe previous Dutch governor, [[Herman Willem Daendels]], had built a well-defended fortification at [[Meester Cornelis]] (now [[Jatinegara]]), and at the time, the governor, [[Jan Willem Janssens]] (who, coincidentally, had surrendered to the British five years earlier at the [[Cape Colony]]), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defence at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured.\n\nThe British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the [[Lieutenant-Governor of the Dutch East Indies]] by Baron Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at [[Buitenzorg]] and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure.\n\n===Rule===\nDuring the relatively brief British rule in Java, Raffles negotiated peace and mounted some significant military expeditions against local Javanese princes to subjugate them to British rule. Most significant of these was the assault on Yogyakarta on 21 June 1812; Yogyakarta was one of the two most powerful indigenous polities in Java. During the attack, the Yogyakarta [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] was badly damaged and extensively looted by British troops. Raffles seized much of the contents of the court archive. The event was unprecedented in Javanese history.

In 1815, he left again for England shortly before the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], under the terms of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]]. Raffles had been removed from his post by the East India Company ahead of the handover and officially replaced by [[John Fendall, Jr.|John Fendall]] on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration and allegations of financial impropriety on his own part. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name and, en route, visited [[Napoleon]], who was in exile at [[St. Helena]], but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.\n\n==Interlude in England==\nIn 1817, Raffles wrote and published ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|The History of Java]]'',<ref>Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles: ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|The History of Java]]''; Black, Parbury and Allen for the Hon. East India Company 1817; reprinted in the Cambridge Library Collection, 2010</ref> describing the history of the island from ancient times as well as its geography, flora, and fauna.\n\nIn 1817 he was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[George IV|Prince Regent]] whose daughter, [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name \"Thomas\", preferring to use his middle name, \"Stamford\", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with Sir Thomas Sevestre or his cousin [[Thomas Raffles]] who bore the same name.\n\nOn 22 February he married his second wife, [[Sophia Hull]],<ref name=\"BritMus\">{{Cite web |title=Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (Biographical details) |author=Anon |work=British Museum |date=n.d. |access-date=3 May 2019 |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=137783 |language= |quote=}}</ref> and later set sail to [[British Bencoolen|Bencoolen]] (present day [[Bengkulu (city)|Bengkulu]] in [[Indonesia]]) to take up his new post with his new wife.\n\n==Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya (Malaysia)==\n[[File:Southern Sumatra, De Grote Winkler Prins Encyclopedia 1910.jpg|thumb|Territory of Bencoolen (pink)]]\n[[File:George Francis Joseph - Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Raffles in 1817 by [[George Francis Joseph]]. [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]\nRaffles arrived in Bencoolen on 19 March 1818, where he was appointed as the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen]] on 22 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title of Lieutenant-Governor, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wrecked, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java&nbsp;\u2013 abolishing slavery and limiting [[cockfighting]] and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of [[convicts]], already sent to him from India.\n\nIt was at this point that he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. However, the strategic importance of poorly maintained but well-positioned [[British overseas territories|British possessions]] such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch ''de jure'' Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]]. Raffles looked into alternatives in the area&nbsp;\u2013 namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java. [[Bintan]] was also under consideration. Despite the fact that [[Francis Light]] overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the [[Riau Archipelago]] was an attractive choice just to the south of the [[Malay Peninsula]], for its proximity to [[Malacca]].\n\nIn his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented. However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]]. The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the [[Sultanate of Minangkabau]]. Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.\n\n==Founding of modern Singapore==\n{{main article|Founding of modern Singapore}}\n[[File:Stamford Raffles statue Crop.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by [[Thomas Woolner]]]]\nMajor [[William Farquhar]], the [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate [[Commercial treaty|commercial treaties]] with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially before Raffles's arrival. Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau]]. He noted it as a success and reported it as such to Raffles. \n\nRaffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially ''Singapura'', which was favoured by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations. Despite [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings']] less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Lieutenant-Governor of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure permission to set up a settlement. At this point in [[History of Malaysia|Malaysian history]] the name ''Lion City'' was applied. The city was in a strategically advantageous position; however, he was ordered not to provoke the Dutch, and his subsequent actions were officially disavowed by the British government.\n\nIn London, [[Viscount Castlereagh]] attempted to quell Dutch fears, and continuing efforts were made to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of London of 1824. As well as the treaty, instructions were sent out to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions; however, distance between the Far East and Europe meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time.\n\n===Establishment===\nAfter a brief survey of the [[Karimun Islands]], on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johor also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the [[Temenggong Abdul Rahman]]. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the British protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio (Riau). A few days later, the formal treaty was signed by a man who claimed to be the \"lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Johor]] to Mount Muar.\" \n\nThis man was [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Hussein Shah]], who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the [[Royal Navy|British navy]] and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussein Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor.\n\nFarquhar's attempt to establish a more favourable treaty in Rhio (Riau) was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio (Riau), Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.\n\nRaffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. With much pomp and ceremony, the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants.\n\nSultan Hussein Shah was paid [[Spanish dollars]] 5,000 a year while Temenggong Abdul Rahman received 3,000 a year, both massive sums at the time, roughly equivalent to \u00a3287,000 and \u00a3172,000 now.<ref>{{Cite book|title=One Hundred Years of Singapore: being some account of the capital of the straits from its foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on the 6th February 1819 to the 6th February 1919|last=Blagden|first=C.O.|publisher=John Murray|year=1921|isbn=|editor-last=Makepeace|editor-first=Walter|location=London|pages=10|chapter=Historical: Singapore prior to 1819}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency-converter/|title= Currency converter: 1270\u20132017|website=The National Archives|language=en-GB|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref><!--I mean we need an actual conversion rate-->.\n\nFarquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore and Raffles was named as \"Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio (Riau), Lingin and Johor\". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the [[Strait of Singapore]] and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.\n\n===Achin, and the early conflict with the Dutch===\nRaffles also planned to start a British presence in [[Acheh|Achin]], on the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he had departed, the Raja of Rhio (Riau) sent letters to the Dutch, disclaiming the deal, protesting innocence and blaming British encroachment. Meanwhile, in Malacca the Dutch acted at once, commanding that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation: although Penang was clearly closer in distance to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, was nominally still in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison.\n\nOfficial Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the [[Dutch Governor-General]] in Java, they did not take any military action. The confused political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. [[Tengku Long]] was claimed to be a [[pretender]] to the throne, and, since the [[Order of succession|succession]] laws in the Malay sultanates were not clear cut, treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of invalidation; especially if a sultan should be deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.\n\nNonetheless amidst uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with [[Panglima Polim]], a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant [[John Palmer (merchant)|John Palmer]], Raffles, and fellow commissioner [[John Monckton Coombs]] of Penang sat offshore, awaiting a response, [[Calcutta]] debated whether to reinforce the port city. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and ultimately Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the [[Governor of Penang]], to send funds to bolster Singapore. Finally Raffles was capable of convincing his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with [[Jauhar al-Alam Shah]], the ruler of Achin, which installed a British resident as well as guaranteeing the exclusivity of bi-lateral trade.\n\nBy the time Raffles had returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the colony had caused in Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators packed onto the island. Raffles was determined to destroy the Dutch mercantile monopoly in the area to replace it with a gateway for trade with China and Japan. The latter he had attempted but failed to reach an agreement while governing Java.\n\n===First year of Singapore===\nWhile in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed [[missionaries]] and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to [[Ethnic segregation|segregate]] the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise no other duties were imposed.\n\nConfident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, Raffles sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.\n\n==Bencoolen, once again==\nRaffles was still the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen]] when he returned. Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his rule over the colonies. Forced labour was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a [[free port]] as well. The currency was regulated and, as he had an excess of out-of-work [[civil servants]], they formed committees to advise him on the daily running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden: the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the [[salutary neglect]] Raffles granted upon Singapore, he delayed European-inspired reforms emphasising only the cultivation of whatever land was available.\n\nNative authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Lieutenant-Governor. The slave-debtor system was brought in, instead of the old slavery system that Raffles had abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on children instead of the entire population. Raffles looked into a long-term plan for the slow reform of Bencoolen.\n\nUnlike many other European adventurers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonised the alien language or culture of the coloniser. In addition to preserving the [[Cultural heritage|artifacts]], [[fauna]], and [[flora]] of his colonies, he also allowed [[religious freedom]], which was especially important as the [[Malay states]] were largely [[Muslim]]. [[Christianity|Christian]] schools were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.\n\n===Consolidation of the Eastern Isles===\nColonel Bannerman's death in Penang in October 1819 brought new opportunities for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to [[Cochinchina|Cochin China]]. He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the [[Indies|East Indies]]. During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.\n\nThe Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron [[Godert van der Capellen]] and Calcutta continued throughout this time.\nThe legitimacy of the British treaties was also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.\n\n==Administration of Bencoolen, 1820\u20131822==\nRaffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island he now called home. He studied the [[Batak]] [[cannibals]] of [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.\n\nBy early 1820, Tengku Long had firmly established himself as the [[Sultan of Johor]] to the British, but the political situation in the area remained a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the [[Resident of Singapore]], replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand. He also found that Singapore's trade was slowly overtaking that of Java.\n\nAs in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plant and animal, as well as describing them in his journals. He located other tribes and recorded their customs, especially their [[religions]] and laws. Bringing the island of [[Nias]] under British rule he noted its civilized state and high production yields of rice.\n\nYet the production of food remained a problem. In Bencoolen Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], including an introduction to the only issue of ''Proceedings of the Agricultural Society''. In order to remedy the shortages his employer, the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], concerned themselves only with profit-taking. Even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony like an estate, his expenditure on nature preservation was seriously frowned upon. In both Calcutta and London they discussed his removal from office, while [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.\n\nLuckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations continued in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside the politics of the local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge of Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by force when Castlereagh's negotiations had ended. Still William Farquhar stirred up more trouble, especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially. [[Public works]], commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, were becoming overwhelmingly expensive.\n\nPersonal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold Stamford (b. 1818), died during an [[epidemic]] on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte (b. 1818), was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden (b. 1820), who would perish first with the disease, on 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four months the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]] as the [[Governor-General of India]], replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and their only surviving child, Ella.\n\nRaffles was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1822.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistr American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>\n\n==Singapore (1822\u20131823)==\n[[File:Plan of the Town of Singapore (1822) by Lieutenant Philip Jackson original.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ''Plan of the Town of Singapore'', also known more commonly as the [[Jackson Plan]] or Raffles Town Plan]]\n\nRaffles was pleased with the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such a short period of time. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and economic activity. Even so, Farquhar's administration was deemed unsatisfactory, for example, allowing merchants to encroach on government areas, permitted vices such as gambling, and toleration of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Turnbull2009\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38 |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819\u20132005 |last=Turnbull |first=C.M. |date= 2009 |publisher=NUS Press |isbn=978-9971694302  |author-link=Mary Turnbull}}</ref>{{rp|38}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/article/william-farquhars-pragmatism |title=William Farquhar's Pragmatism: Another Perspective on Raffles Vision for Singapore |author= Kevin Khoo|work=National Archives of Singapore}}</ref> In response Raffles instituted new policies and set up a committee headed by the colony's engineer, [[Philip Jackson (surveyor)|Philip Jackson]] to draw up a plan, now known as the [[Jackson Plan]] or Raffles Town Plan, based on instructions by Raffles.\n\nThe plan was still racially segregated, giving the best land to the Europeans. Yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the port town that Farquhar dramatically argued with Raffles, who now considered him unfit for the position of Resident. The founder took direct control; and with a heavy hand. In 1823, he instituted a code of settlement for the populace, which was soon followed by laws regarding freedom of trade. A registration system was quickly instituted for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistracy were then set up on British principles, turning a trading post into a proper city with some semblance of order.\n\nRepeated efforts were made to persuade Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar; but they remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johor a British protectorate, raising a protest from Van der Capellen. Eventually Calcutta appointed [[John Crawfurd]], who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the new Resident of Singapore, while Captain [[William Gordon MacKenzie]] took over [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]]. In March 1823, coincidentally the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.\n\nWith politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved observations on his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2,000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4,000.\n\nIn 1823, Raffles drafted a series of administrative regulations for Singapore that aimed to govern Singapore in a fair manner but also reflected his stance on various moral and social issues. He outlawed gambling, imposed heavy taxation on what he considered social evils such as drunkenness and opium-smoking, and banned slavery.<ref name=\"Turnbull2009\" />{{rp|40}} A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population to remain as they were; and no crimes were entirely based on racial principles. Raffles worked on drafting laws, defining exactly \"what\" constituted a criminal act. Finally, on 9 June 1823, feeling that his work in establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen followed. Tragedy befell Raffles once more when his youngest daughter Flora Nightingall, born on 19 September, died a little over one month later on 28 November while still in Bencoolen.\n\nOn 2 February 1824, Raffles and his family embarked on the [[East Indiaman]] {{ship||Fame|1818 ship|2}} for England. Unfortunately, she caught fire 50 miles from Bencoolen the evening after she sailed. All aboard were able to take to her boats and were saved, although the ship herself was totally destroyed.<ref>{{Cite news |title=From Lloyd's Marine List \u2013&nbsp;\u2013 July 20. |newspaper=Caledonian Mercury |date=24 July 1824 |issue=16060}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006563186;view=1up;seq=203 |title=The Marine List |journal=Lloyd's List |issue=5929 |date=30 July 1824}}</ref> The fire claimed all his drawings and papers.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the [[Indian subcontinent]] were both free of Dutch interference. Raffles finally returned to England on 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.\n\n==Return to Britain and death==\n[[File:RafflesArms1.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Raffles]]\n\nUpon arrival in England in poor health, Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in [[Cheltenham]] until September 1824, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made plans to stand for parliament, but this ambition was never realised. They removed to a London address at [[Berners Street]] at the end of November 1824, just in time to have a war of words with Farquhar, who had also arrived in the city, in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore. Despite raising several severe charges against Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him; he was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but was given a military promotion instead.\n\nWith the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great interests&nbsp;\u2013 botany and zoology. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the [[Zoological Society of London]] and the [[London Zoo]]. Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a [[pension]], but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for losses incurred during his administration. Raffles replied by clarifying his actions: and he decided to move to his country estate, Highwood, north London, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.\n\nHe died at Highwood House in Mill Hill, north London, on his 45th birthday, on 5 July 1826, of [[apoplexy]]. His estate amounted to around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery]] position, he was refused burial inside the local parish church ([[St Mary's Church, Hendon]]) by the [[vicar]], Theodor Williams, whose family had made its money in Jamaica in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 but the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s, his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building and a square floor tablet with inscription marked the spot.\n\nRaffles was survived by his second wife Sophia Hull and daughter Ella, and predeceased by his other four children in [[Bencoolen (city)|Bencoolen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_785_2005-01-24.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307141541/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_785_2005-01-24.html |archivedate=7 March 2012}}</ref> Ella died in 1840, aged nineteen. Sophia remained at Highwood House until her death in 1858, at the age of 72. Her tomb and memorial may be seen in St Paul's Church graveyard, Mill Hill, close to the rear door of the church.

1826){{r|Bastin}}{{r|Sophia Raffles}} was a British [[wikt:statesman|statesman]], [[Lieutenant-Governor of the Dutch East Indies]] (1811\u20131816) and [[Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen]] (1818\u20131824), best known for his founding of modern [[Singapore]] and [[British Malaya]].\n\nHe was heavily involved in [[Invasion of Java (1811)|the conquest]] of the Indonesian island of [[Java]] from Dutch and French military forces during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and contributed to the expansion of the [[British Empire]]. He also wrote ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|The History of Java]]'' (1817).\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Stamford Bingley Raffles was born on 5 July 1781 on board the ship ''Ann'' off the coast of [[Port Morant]], [[Jamaica]]{{r|Sophia Raffles}}, to Captain Benjamin Raffles (1739, London \u2013 23 November 1811, Deptford) and Anne Raffles (n\u00e9e Lyde) (1755 \u2013 8 February 1824, London).{{r|Bastin}} His father was a {{citation needed span|text=[[Yorkshire]]man|date=July 2018}} who had a burgeoning family{{r|Bastin}} and {{citation needed span|text=little luck in the West Indies trade during the [[American Revolution]], sending the family into debt.|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the little money the family had, it went into schooling Raffles where he attended a boarding school. In 1795, at the age of 14, Raffles started working as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] in London for the [[British East India Company]], the trading company that shaped many of Britain's overseas conquests. Nine years later, in 1804, the 23-year-old Raffles married [[Olivia Mariamne Devenish]], a widow 10 years his senior{{r|\"Bastin\"|pages=57, 73, 107}}, who was formerly married to Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800.{{r|\"Bastin\"|pages=59, 69}}\n\nIn 1805, he was sent to [[Prince of Wales Island (Malaysia)|Prince of Wales Island]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], starting his long association with [[Southeast Asia]]. He started with a post, as assistant secretary, under the Honourable [[Philip Dundas]], the new Governor of Penang.<ref name=\"BritMus\" /> At this time he also made the acquaintance of [[Thomas Otho Travers]], who would accompany him for the next twenty years.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Java==\n===British invasion of Java===\nHis knowledge of the [[Malay language]], as well as his wit and ability, gained him favour with [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, Baron Minto|Lord Minto]], the then [[Governor-General of India]], and he was sent to [[Malacca]].\n\nIn 1811, after the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] by France during Napoleon's war, Raffles had no choice but to leave the country. He mounted [[Invasion of Java (1811)|a military expedition]] against the Dutch and French in [[Java]], in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The war was swiftly conducted by Admiral [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]], General [[Frederick Augustus Wetherall]], and Colonel [[Robert Rollo Gillespie]], who led a well-organized army against an army of mostly French conscripts with little proper leadership.\n\nThe previous Dutch governor, [[Herman Willem Daendels]], had built a well-defended fortification at [[Meester Cornelis]] (now [[Jatinegara]]), and at the time, the governor, [[Jan Willem Janssens]] (who, coincidentally, had surrendered to the British five years earlier at the [[Cape Colony]]), mounted a brave but ultimately futile defence at the fortress. The British, led by Colonel Gillespie, stormed the fort and captured it within three hours. Janssens attempted to escape inland but was captured.\n\nThe British invasion of Java took a total of forty-five days, during which Raffles was appointed the [[Lieutenant-Governor of the Dutch East Indies]] by Baron Minto before hostilities formally ceased. He took his residence at [[Buitenzorg]] and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure.\n\n===Rule===\nDuring the relatively brief British rule in Java, Raffles negotiated peace and mounted some significant military expeditions against local Javanese princes to subjugate them to British rule. Most significant of these was the assault on Yogyakarta on 21 June 1812; Yogyakarta was one of the two most powerful indigenous polities in Java. During the attack, the Yogyakarta [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] was badly damaged and extensively looted by British troops. Raffles seized much of the contents of the court archive. The event was unprecedented in Javanese history. It was the first time an indigenous court had been taken by storm by a European army, and the humiliation of the local aristocracy was profound.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200 |last=Ricklefs |first=M. C. |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2008 |edition=4th |author-link=M. C. Ricklefs}}</ref> \n\nAlthough peace returned to Central Java in the immediate aftermath of the British assault, the events may have fuelled the deep-seated instability and hostility to European involvement that ultimately gave rise to the [[Java War]] of the 1820s.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Power of Prophecy: Prince Dipanagara and the End of an Old Order in Java, 1785\u20131855 |last=Carey |first=Peter |year=2008 |author-link=Peter Carey (historian)}}</ref> Raffles also ordered an expedition to Palembang in Sumatra to unseat the local sultan, [[Mahmud Badaruddin II]], and to seize the nearby [[Bangka Island]] to set up a permanent British presence in the area in the case of the return of Java to Dutch rule after the end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] in Europe.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gedenksteen van T.S.

Raffles re-landscaped these gardens, which were established in 1744 in Buitenzorg (now [[Bogor]]), [[West Java]].]]\n\nDuring his lieutenant-governorship, Raffles placed some restrictions on the local slave trade in line with wider British policy across its Asian territories, although slavery remained widespread and Raffles himself was served by a large retinue of slaves at his official residences in Java.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Raffles of Singapore |last=Hahn |first=Emily |year=1946 |author-link=Emily Hahn}}</ref> Raffles also attempted a replacement of the Dutch system of forced agricultural deliveries in kind with a cash-based [[land tenure]] system of land management, probably influenced by the earlier writings of Dirk van Hogendorp (1761\u20131822).\n\nUnder Raffles's aegis, a large number of ancient monuments in Java were systematically catalogued for the first time. The first detailed English-language account of [[Prambanan]] was prepared by [[Colin Mackenzie]] while [[Borobudur]] was surveyed and cleared of vegetation by H. C. Cornelius.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miksic|first= John|title= Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas|date= 1990}}</ref>\n\nUnder the harsh conditions of the island, his wife, Olivia, died on 26 November 1814, an event that devastated Raffles. In 1815, he left again for England shortly before the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], under the terms of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]]. Raffles had been removed from his post by the East India Company ahead of the handover and officially replaced by [[John Fendall, Jr.|John Fendall]] on account of the poor financial performance of the colony during his administration and allegations of financial impropriety on his own part. He sailed to England in early 1816 to clear his name and, en route, visited [[Napoleon]], who was in exile at [[St. Helena]], but found him unpleasant and unimpressive.\n\n==Interlude in England==\nIn 1817, Raffles wrote and published ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|The History of Java]]'',<ref>Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles: ''[[The History of Java (1817 book)|The History of Java]]''; Black, Parbury and Allen for the Hon. East India Company 1817; reprinted in the Cambridge Library Collection, 2010</ref> describing the history of the island from ancient times as well as its geography, flora, and fauna.\n\nIn 1817 he was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[George IV|Prince Regent]] whose daughter, [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], was particularly close to him. At the publication of the book, he also stopped using the name \"Thomas\", preferring to use his middle name, \"Stamford\", possibly to avoid confusion amongst his associates with Sir Thomas Sevestre or his cousin [[Thomas Raffles]] who bore the same name.\n\nOn 22 February he married his second wife, [[Sophia Hull]],<ref name=\"BritMus\">{{Cite web |title=Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (Biographical details) |author=Anon |work=British Museum |date=n.d. |access-date=3 May 2019 |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=137783 |language= |quote=}}</ref> and later set sail to [[British Bencoolen|Bencoolen]] (present day [[Bengkulu (city)|Bengkulu]] in [[Indonesia]]) to take up his new post with his new wife.\n\n==Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and Malaya (Malaysia)==\n[[File:Southern Sumatra, De Grote Winkler Prins Encyclopedia 1910.jpg|thumb|Territory of Bencoolen (pink)]]\n[[File:George Francis Joseph - Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Raffles in 1817 by [[George Francis Joseph]]. [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]\nRaffles arrived in Bencoolen on 19 March 1818, where he was appointed as the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen]] on 22 March 1818. Despite the prestige connected with the title of Lieutenant-Governor, Bencoolen was a colonial backwater whose only real export was pepper and only the murder of a previous Resident, Thomas Parr, gained it any attention back home in Britain. Raffles found the place wrecked, and set about reforms immediately, mostly similar to what he had done in Java&nbsp;\u2013 abolishing slavery and limiting [[cockfighting]] and such games. To replace the slaves, he used a contingent of [[convicts]], already sent to him from India.\n\nIt was at this point that he realized the importance of a British presence that both challenged the Dutch hegemony in the area and could remain consistently profitable, unlike Bencoolen or [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. However, the strategic importance of poorly maintained but well-positioned [[British overseas territories|British possessions]] such as Penang or Bencoolen made it impossible for the British to abandon such unprofitable colonies in such proximity to the Dutch in Java. The competition in the area, between Raffles and the aggressive Dutch ''de jure'' Governor, Elout, certainly led at least in part to the later [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]]. Raffles looked into alternatives in the area&nbsp;\u2013 namely Bangka, which had been ceded to the Dutch after its conquest by the British during its occupation of Java. [[Bintan]] was also under consideration. Despite the fact that [[Francis Light]] overlooked the island before settling upon Penang in 1786, the [[Riau Archipelago]] was an attractive choice just to the south of the [[Malay Peninsula]], for its proximity to [[Malacca]].\n\nIn his correspondences with Calcutta, Raffles also emphasized the need to establish a certain amount of influence with the native chiefs, which had greatly waned since the return of the Dutch. Raffles sent Thomas Travers as an ambassador to the Dutch, to possibly negotiate an expansion of British economic interests. When this failed, and when Raffles' own expeditions into his new dominion found only treacherous terrain and few exportable goods, his desire to establish a better British presence was cemented. However, the Anglo-Dutch Convention of 1814 was not completely clear, especially on the issue of certain possessions such as [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]]. The Convention of 1814 only returned Dutch territory that was held before 1803, which did not include Padang. Raffles asserted the British claim personally, leading a small expedition to the [[Sultanate of Minangkabau]]. Yet, as Raffles confirmed with the sultan regarding the absolute British influence of the area, he realized that the local rulers had only limited power over the well-cultivated and civilized country, and the treaty was largely symbolic and had little actual force.\n\n==Founding of modern Singapore==\n{{main article|Founding of modern Singapore}}\n[[File:Stamford Raffles statue Crop.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore, based on the original by [[Thomas Woolner]]]]\nMajor [[William Farquhar]], the [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] of Malacca, had been attempting to negotiate [[Commercial treaty|commercial treaties]] with the local chiefs of the Riau Archipelago, especially before Raffles's arrival. Farquhar was compelled to sign the treaty not with the official head of the sultanate, but rather, the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Raja Muda (Regent or Crown Prince) of Riau]]. He noted it as a success and reported it as such to Raffles. \n\nRaffles sailed to Malacca in late 1818 to personally secure a British presence in the Riau area, especially ''Singapura'', which was favoured by him both through the readings of Malayan histories and by Farquhar's explorations. Despite [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings']] less-than-stellar opinion of Raffles before (which had necessitated his trip to England to clear his name at the end of his tenure as Lieutenant-Governor of Java), the now well-connected and successful Raffles was able to secure permission to set up a settlement. At this point in [[History of Malaysia|Malaysian history]] the name ''Lion City'' was applied. The city was in a strategically advantageous position; however, he was ordered not to provoke the Dutch, and his subsequent actions were officially disavowed by the British government.\n\nIn London, [[Viscount Castlereagh]] attempted to quell Dutch fears, and continuing efforts were made to reach an agreement between the nations that eventually became the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of London of 1824. As well as the treaty, instructions were sent out to Raffles to undertake far less intrusive actions; however, distance between the Far East and Europe meant that the orders had no chance of reaching Raffles in time.\n\n===Establishment===\nAfter a brief survey of the [[Karimun Islands]], on 29 January 1819, he established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It was established that there was no Dutch presence on the island of Singapore. Johor also no longer had any control of the area, so contact was made with the [[Temenggong Abdul Rahman]]. The contacts were friendly and Raffles, knowledgeable about the muddled political situation, took advantage to provide a rudimentary treaty between the nominal chiefs of the area that called for the exclusivity of trade and the British protection of the area. Members of Raffles' party surveyed the island and proceeded to request the presence of the sultan, or whoever at the time had supreme nominal power, to sign a formal treaty, while Major Farquhar was ordered to do the same in Rhio (Riau). A few days later, the formal treaty was signed by a man who claimed to be the \"lawful sovereign of the whole of territories extending from [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Johor]] to Mount Muar.\" \n\nThis man was [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Hussein Shah]], who, although having had no previous contact with the British, had certainly heard of the might of the [[Royal Navy|British navy]] and was in no position to argue against the terms. However, Raffles was able to charm the man and to reassure him that the Dutch posed no threat in the area. Hussein Shah had been the crown Prince of Johor, but while he was away in Pahang to get married, his father died and his younger brother was made sultan, supported by some of the court officials and the Dutch. To circumvent the situation of having to negotiate with a sultan influenced by the Dutch, Raffles decided to recognise, on behalf of the British Crown, Hussein Shah as being the rightful ruler of Johor.\n\nFarquhar's attempt to establish a more favourable treaty in Rhio (Riau) was met with greater challenge, as the Dutch were present and made for a rather awkward position. The Dutch were alarmed and sent a small contingent to the island. Despite a covert offer of subterfuge against the Dutch offered by the Raja of Rhio (Riau), Farquhar returned and an official protest was sent by the Raja to Java regarding the matter.\n\nRaffles declared the foundation of what was to become modern Singapore on 6 February, securing the transfer of control of the island to the East India Company. With much pomp and ceremony, the official treaty was read aloud in languages representing all nations present, as well as the Malay and Chinese inhabitants.\n\nSultan Hussein Shah was paid [[Spanish dollars]] 5,000 a year while Temenggong Abdul Rahman received 3,000 a year, both massive sums at the time, roughly equivalent to \u00a3287,000 and \u00a3172,000 now.<ref>{{Cite book|title=One Hundred Years of Singapore: being some account of the capital of the straits from its foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on the 6th February 1819 to the 6th February 1919|last=Blagden|first=C.O.|publisher=John Murray|year=1921|isbn=|editor-last=Makepeace|editor-first=Walter|location=London|pages=10|chapter=Historical: Singapore prior to 1819}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency-converter/|title= Currency converter: 1270\u20132017|website=The National Archives|language=en-GB|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref><!--I mean we need an actual conversion rate-->.\n\nFarquhar was officially named the Resident of Singapore and Raffles was named as \"Agent to the Most Noble the Governor-General with the States of Rhio (Riau), Lingin and Johor\". Although ownership of the post was to be exclusively British, explicit orders were given to Farquhar to maintain free passage of ships through the [[Strait of Singapore]] and a small military presence was established alongside the trading post. After issuing orders to Farquhar and the remaining Europeans, Raffles left the next day, 7 February 1819.\n\n===Achin, and the early conflict with the Dutch===\nRaffles also planned to start a British presence in [[Acheh|Achin]], on the northern tip of Sumatra. As soon as he had departed, the Raja of Rhio (Riau) sent letters to the Dutch, disclaiming the deal, protesting innocence and blaming British encroachment. Meanwhile, in Malacca the Dutch acted at once, commanding that no Malays could go to Singapore. Raffles' bold claim of Singapore created a curious geographic situation: although Penang was clearly closer in distance to Singapore, Raffles, in his capacity as Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, was nominally still in control. This undoubtedly irked the authorities in Penang to the point where they refused to send any sepoys to Singapore to complete the garrison.\n\nOfficial Dutch complaints came before the end of the month, and Raffles attempted to appease the situation by instructing Farquhar to not interfere with the politics of surrounding islands. Despite numerous threats and serious considerations by the [[Dutch Governor-General]] in Java, they did not take any military action. The confused political situation in Johore and Rhio also created a certain uneasiness and instability for the two nations. [[Tengku Long]] was claimed to be a [[pretender]] to the throne, and, since the [[Order of succession|succession]] laws in the Malay sultanates were not clear cut, treaties signed between native rulers and the European powers always seemed to be on the verge of invalidation; especially if a sultan should be deposed by one of his siblings or other pretenders.\n\nNonetheless amidst uncertainty and intrigue, Raffles landed in Achin on 14 March 1819, with begrudging help of Penang. Once again, it seems that multiple people were in power, but none wanted to formally deal with the British. The hostile atmosphere created allowed Raffles to cancel the only meeting he was able to arrange, with [[Panglima Polim]], a powerful divisional chief, fearing treachery. As the influential merchant [[John Palmer (merchant)|John Palmer]], Raffles, and fellow commissioner [[John Monckton Coombs]] of Penang sat offshore, awaiting a response, [[Calcutta]] debated whether to reinforce the port city. Evacuation plans were made, but the Dutch never acted and ultimately Lord Hastings prompted Colonel Bannerman, the [[Governor of Penang]], to send funds to bolster Singapore. Finally Raffles was capable of convincing his fellow commissioners to sign a treaty with [[Jauhar al-Alam Shah]], the ruler of Achin, which installed a British resident as well as guaranteeing the exclusivity of bi-lateral trade.\n\nBy the time Raffles had returned to Singapore, on 31 May, much of the immediate crisis that the colony had caused in Penang and Calcutta had passed. By then, the initial five-hundred villagers had grown to become five-thousand merchants, soldiers, and administrators packed onto the island. Raffles was determined to destroy the Dutch mercantile monopoly in the area to replace it with a gateway for trade with China and Japan. The latter he had attempted but failed to reach an agreement while governing Java.\n\n===First year of Singapore===\nWhile in Singapore, Raffles established schools and churches in the native languages. He allowed [[missionaries]] and local businesses to flourish. Certain colonial aspects remained: a European town was quickly built to [[Ethnic segregation|segregate]] the population, separated by a river; carriage roads were built and cantonments constructed for the soldiers. Otherwise no other duties were imposed.\n\nConfident that Farquhar would follow his instructions well, Raffles sailed for Bencoolen once again on 28 June.\n\n==Bencoolen, once again==\nRaffles was still the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen]] when he returned. Raffles started more reforms that were, by now, almost trademarks of his rule over the colonies. Forced labour was abolished when he first arrived, and he declared Bencoolen a [[free port]] as well. The currency was regulated and, as he had an excess of out-of-work [[civil servants]], they formed committees to advise him on the daily running of the colony. However, Bencoolen was not as self-sufficient as Singapore. The area was poor and disease-ridden: the first reports from the committees reflected very poorly upon the condition of the colony. Unlike the [[salutary neglect]] Raffles granted upon Singapore, he delayed European-inspired reforms emphasising only the cultivation of whatever land was available.\n\nNative authorities were given power in their respective districts and were answerable only to the Lieutenant-Governor. The slave-debtor system was brought in, instead of the old slavery system that Raffles had abolished in Java, Borneo, and initially in Bencoolen. Slave-debtors were registered, and educational reforms started to focus on children instead of the entire population. Raffles looked into a long-term plan for the slow reform of Bencoolen.\n\nUnlike many other European adventurers, Raffles did not impose upon the colonised the alien language or culture of the coloniser. In addition to preserving the [[Cultural heritage|artifacts]], [[fauna]], and [[flora]] of his colonies, he also allowed [[religious freedom]], which was especially important as the [[Malay states]] were largely [[Muslim]]. [[Christianity|Christian]] schools were started by missionaries in all of his colonies.\n\n===Consolidation of the Eastern Isles===\nColonel Bannerman's death in Penang in October 1819 brought new opportunities for Raffles to expand his power to also include the other minor British factories and outposts from Sumatra to [[Cochinchina|Cochin China]]. He sailed to Calcutta and as Lord Hastings sought to consolidate all of the small British possessions in the [[Indies|East Indies]]. During his sojourn, he had the opportunity to argue for free trade and the protection of the private enterprise. Education and the retention of small British outposts were also discussed.\n\nThe Dutch claim on the Sultanate of Johore and hence, Rhio, and the diplomatic exchanges between Baron [[Godert van der Capellen]] and Calcutta continued throughout this time.\nThe legitimacy of the British treaties was also questioned once again, but finally, as Singapore grew at an exponential rate, the Dutch gave up their claim on the island, allowing the colony to continue as a British possession. However, the pressures put upon Calcutta ensured that no single governor of all British possessions in the Strait or on Sumatra was appointed, and Raffles, whose health was slowly ailing, returned to Bencoolen.\n\n==Administration of Bencoolen, 1820\u20131822==\nRaffles returned to Bencoolen in ill-health, but as his health improved, he continued on his quest to learn about the island he now called home. He studied the [[Batak]] [[cannibals]] of [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods. He also noted the rise of the Sikh religion in certain parts of Sumatra.\n\nBy early 1820, Tengku Long had firmly established himself as the [[Sultan of Johor]] to the British, but the political situation in the area remained a befuddled mess, with the old sultan dying and many new ones attempting to gain either the crown or regency. As Farquhar was involving himself poorly in local politics, Raffles appointed Travers as the [[Resident of Singapore]], replacing Farquhar. Upon his arrival, Travers found the colony a delightful sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of different races and cultures, numbering over six thousand. He also found that Singapore's trade was slowly overtaking that of Java.\n\nAs in Java, Raffles collected samples of local species of plant and animal, as well as describing them in his journals. He located other tribes and recorded their customs, especially their [[religions]] and laws. Bringing the island of [[Nias]] under British rule he noted its civilized state and high production yields of rice.\n\nYet the production of food remained a problem. In Bencoolen Raffles paid special attention to the agricultural methods of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], including an introduction to the only issue of ''Proceedings of the Agricultural Society''. In order to remedy the shortages his employer, the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], concerned themselves only with profit-taking. Even as Raffles lived like a country gentleman and ran his colony like an estate, his expenditure on nature preservation was seriously frowned upon. In both Calcutta and London they discussed his removal from office, while [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] continued negotiations with the Dutch regarding the ongoing diplomatic conflicts.\n\nLuckily, the Singapore issue had its supporters in the House, so as negotiations continued in Europe, Raffles remained largely idle in Bencoolen. The only major issue, outside the politics of the local sultans, involved the replacement of Farquhar, who decided that he had no intention of leaving his post voluntarily, causing a moment of tension between him and Travers. Raffles' request for Travers to deliver dispatches to India nullified the issue late in the year, and Farquhar remained in charge of Singapore, with its survival still in doubt for many in both India and London, who believed that it would either be handed over to the Dutch or taken violently by force when Castlereagh's negotiations had ended. Still William Farquhar stirred up more trouble, especially with local English merchants over trivial matters of self-importance and overreaction over small infractions of white traders, for some of which he was reprimanded by Calcutta officially. [[Public works]], commissioned by Raffles but undertaken by Farquhar, were becoming overwhelmingly expensive.\n\nPersonal tragedies also started for Raffles. His eldest son, Leopold Stamford (b. 1818), died during an [[epidemic]] on 4 July 1821. The oldest daughter, Charlotte (b. 1818), was also sick with dysentery by the end of the year, but it would be his youngest son, Stamford Marsden (b. 1820), who would perish first with the disease, on 3 January 1822, with Charlotte to follow ten days later. For the good part of four months the couple remained devastated. The year would be eventful with the suicide of Castlereagh and the appointment of [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]] as the [[Governor-General of India]], replacing Hastings. As Raffles grew restless and depressed, he decided to visit Singapore before heading home to England. Accompanying him would be his wife Sophia and their only surviving child, Ella.\n\nRaffles was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1822.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistr American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>\n\n==Singapore (1822\u20131823)==\n[[File:Plan of the Town of Singapore (1822) by Lieutenant Philip Jackson original.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ''Plan of the Town of Singapore'', also known more commonly as the [[Jackson Plan]] or Raffles Town Plan]]\n\nRaffles was pleased with the fact that Singapore had grown exponentially in such a short period of time. The colony was a bustling hub of trade and economic activity. Even so, Farquhar's administration was deemed unsatisfactory, for example, allowing merchants to encroach on government areas, permitted vices such as gambling, and toleration of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Turnbull2009\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38 |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819\u20132005 |last=Turnbull |first=C.M. |date= 2009 |publisher=NUS Press |isbn=978-9971694302  |author-link=Mary Turnbull}}</ref>{{rp|38}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/article/william-farquhars-pragmatism |title=William Farquhar's Pragmatism: Another Perspective on Raffles Vision for Singapore |author= Kevin Khoo|work=National Archives of Singapore}}</ref> In response Raffles instituted new policies and set up a committee headed by the colony's engineer, [[Philip Jackson (surveyor)|Philip Jackson]] to draw up a plan, now known as the [[Jackson Plan]] or Raffles Town Plan, based on instructions by Raffles.\n\nThe plan was still racially segregated, giving the best land to the Europeans. Yet it was considered remarkably scientific for the time. It was also during the replanning and reconstruction of the port town that Farquhar dramatically argued with Raffles, who now considered him unfit for the position of Resident. The founder took direct control; and with a heavy hand. In 1823, he instituted a code of settlement for the populace, which was soon followed by laws regarding freedom of trade. A registration system was quickly instituted for all land, regardless of ownership, and the repossession of the land by the government if land remained unregistered. This act asserted the power of the British government as it covered land previously owned by the Sultan as well. A police force and magistracy were then set up on British principles, turning a trading post into a proper city with some semblance of order.\n\nRepeated efforts were made to persuade Calcutta to send a replacement for Farquhar; but they remained unanswered. As Raffles started to hint at his impending retirement, he made Johor a British protectorate, raising a protest from Van der Capellen. Eventually Calcutta appointed [[John Crawfurd]], who had followed Raffles for over twenty years, as the new Resident of Singapore, while Captain [[William Gordon MacKenzie]] took over [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]]. In March 1823, coincidentally the same day he was replaced, he received an official reprimand from London for the takeover of Nias.\n\nWith politics against him, Raffles finally turned back to the natural sciences. He gave a speech regarding the opening of a Malay college in Singapore that heavily involved observations on his years in Southeast Asia and the importance of both the local and the European languages. Raffles personally gave $2,000 towards the effort, as the East India Company gave $4,000.\n\nIn 1823, Raffles drafted a series of administrative regulations for Singapore that aimed to govern Singapore in a fair manner but also reflected his stance on various moral and social issues. He outlawed gambling, imposed heavy taxation on what he considered social evils such as drunkenness and opium-smoking, and banned slavery.<ref name=\"Turnbull2009\" />{{rp|40}} A specific regulation in the constitution called for the multiethnic population to remain as they were; and no crimes were entirely based on racial principles. Raffles worked on drafting laws, defining exactly \"what\" constituted a criminal act. Finally, on 9 June 1823, feeling that his work in establishing Singapore was finished, he boarded a ship for home, but not before a stop in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to visit his old home and adversary, van der Capellen. A final stop in Bencoolen followed. Tragedy befell Raffles once more when his youngest daughter Flora Nightingall, born on 19 September, died a little over one month later on 28 November while still in Bencoolen.\n\nOn 2 February 1824, Raffles and his family embarked on the [[East Indiaman]] {{ship||Fame|1818 ship|2}} for England. Unfortunately, she caught fire 50 miles from Bencoolen the evening after she sailed. All aboard were able to take to her boats and were saved, although the ship herself was totally destroyed.<ref>{{Cite news |title=From Lloyd's Marine List \u2013&nbsp;\u2013 July 20. |newspaper=Caledonian Mercury |date=24 July 1824 |issue=16060}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006563186;view=1up;seq=203 |title=The Marine List |journal=Lloyd's List |issue=5929 |date=30 July 1824}}</ref> The fire claimed all his drawings and papers.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] finally settled the score in the East Indies. The British gained dominance in the north, while the entirety of Sumatra became Dutch. The Malay Peninsula and the [[Indian subcontinent]] were both free of Dutch interference. Raffles finally returned to England on 22 August 1824, over a year after he left Singapore. His longest tenure in Singapore was only eight months, but he was considered the founder of Singapore nevertheless.\n\n==Return to Britain and death==\n[[File:RafflesArms1.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Raffles]]\n\nUpon arrival in England in poor health, Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles convalesced in [[Cheltenham]] until September 1824, after which he entertained distinguished guests in both London and his home. He also made plans to stand for parliament, but this ambition was never realised. They removed to a London address at [[Berners Street]] at the end of November 1824, just in time to have a war of words with Farquhar, who had also arrived in the city, in front of the Court of Directors of the EIC regarding Singapore. Despite raising several severe charges against Raffles, Farquhar was ultimately unable to discredit him; he was denied a chance to be restored to Singapore, but was given a military promotion instead.\n\nWith the Singapore matter settled, Raffles turned to his other great interests&nbsp;\u2013 botany and zoology. Raffles was a founder (in 1825) and first president (elected April 1826) of the [[Zoological Society of London]] and the [[London Zoo]]. Meanwhile, he was not only not granted a [[pension]], but was called to pay over twenty-two thousand pounds sterling for losses incurred during his administration. Raffles replied by clarifying his actions: and he decided to move to his country estate, Highwood, north London, but before the issue was resolved, he was already much too ill.\n\nHe died at Highwood House in Mill Hill, north London, on his 45th birthday, on 5 July 1826, of [[apoplexy]]. His estate amounted to around ten thousand pounds sterling, which was paid to the Company to cover his outstanding debt. Because of his [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery]] position, he was refused burial inside the local parish church ([[St Mary's Church, Hendon]]) by the [[vicar]], Theodor Williams, whose family had made its money in Jamaica in the slave trade. A brass tablet was finally placed in 1887 but the actual whereabouts of his body was not known until 1914 when it was found in a vault. When the church was extended in the 1920s, his tomb was incorporated into the body of the building and a square floor tablet with inscription marked the spot.\n\nRaffles was survived by his second wife Sophia Hull and daughter Ella, and predeceased by his other four children in [[Bencoolen (city)|Bencoolen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_785_2005-01-24.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307141541/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_785_2005-01-24.html |archivedate=7 March 2012}}</ref> Ella died in 1840, aged nineteen. Sophia remained at Highwood House until her death in 1858, at the age of 72. Her tomb and memorial may be seen in St Paul's Church graveyard, Mill Hill, close to the rear door of the church. All his other children remained buried overseas. Thirty-three years after his death, Raffles's substantial collection of Indonesian antiquities and ethnography was donated to the [[British Museum]] by his nephew, Rev [[William Charles Raffles Flint]].<ref name=\"BritMus\" />\n\n==Memorial sculpture in Westminster Abbey, London, England==\nA life-size figure in white marble by Sir [[Francis Chantrey]] depicts Raffles in a seated position.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks.

The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''). In post-Renaissance paintings the setting is often a locked tower.</ref> This [[mytheme]] is also connected to [[Ares]], [[Oenopion]], [[Eurystheus]], and others.

Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.<ref group=\"note\">Such a banquet, to which each guest brings a gift, was an ''eranos''.

This mythical Ethiopia was ruled by King [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]].  Cassiopeia, having boasted that her daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was equal in beauty to the [[Nereid]]s, drew the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], which destroyed man and beast. The [[Siwa Oasis|oracle of Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore. Perseus slew the monster and, setting her free, claimed her in marriage.\n\n[[Image:Perseus and andromeda amphora.jpg|thumb|right|Perseus rescuing Andromeda from Cetus, depicted on an [[amphora]] in the [[Altes Museum]], Berlin]]\n\nPerseus married Andromeda in spite of [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]], to whom she had before been promised.

Their descendants also ruled Mycenae, from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom. Among the Perseids was the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].</ref> After her death she was placed by Athena among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Catasterismi]]''.</ref> [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille]]) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.\n\nAs Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], according to [[Apollonius of Rhodes]],<ref>''[[Argonautica]]'', IV.</ref> the falling drops of Medusa's blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut [[Mopsus]]. On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor (mythology)|Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''). In post-Renaissance paintings the setting is often a locked tower.</ref> This [[mytheme]] is also connected to [[Ares]], [[Oenopion]], [[Eurystheus]], and others. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and impregnated her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trzaskoma|first=Stephen|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87220-721-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Soon after, their child was born; Perseus\u2014\"Perseus Eurymedon,<ref>''Eurymedon'': \"far-ruling\"</ref> for his mother gave him this name as well\" (Apollonius of Rhodes, ''[[Argonautica]]'' IV).\n\nFearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.<ref>For the familiar motif of the [[Exposed Child]] in the account of [[Moses]] especially, see {{cite journal|last=Childs|first=Brevard S.|authorlink=Brevard S.

Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.<ref group=\"note\">Such a banquet, to which each guest brings a gift, was an ''eranos''.

Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; he would not refuse it.

Hermes lent Perseus [[Talaria|winged sandals]] to fly, and Athena gave him a polished shield. Perseus then proceeded to the Gorgons' cave.\n\nIn the cave he came upon the sleeping [[Medusa]]. By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head. From her neck sprang [[Pegasus]] (\"he who sprang\") and [[Chrysaor]] (\"sword of gold\"), the result of Poseidon and Medusa's mating. The other two Gorgons pursued Perseus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.  37\u201339.</ref> but, wearing his helm of darkness, he escaped.

This mythical Ethiopia was ruled by King [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]].  Cassiopeia, having boasted that her daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was equal in beauty to the [[Nereid]]s, drew the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], which destroyed man and beast. The [[Siwa Oasis|oracle of Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore. Perseus slew the monster and, setting her free, claimed her in marriage.\n\n[[Image:Perseus and andromeda amphora.jpg|thumb|right|Perseus rescuing Andromeda from Cetus, depicted on an [[amphora]] in the [[Altes Museum]], Berlin]]\n\nPerseus married Andromeda in spite of [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]], to whom she had before been promised.

Their descendants also ruled Mycenae, from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom. Among the Perseids was the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].</ref> After her death she was placed by Athena among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Catasterismi]]''.</ref> [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille]]) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.\n\nAs Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], according to [[Apollonius of Rhodes]],<ref>''[[Argonautica]]'', IV.</ref> the falling drops of Medusa's blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut [[Mopsus]]. On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

For instance, the terminal -i of teki 'to see, recognize' when [[affix]]ed by -vnnaka 'to have trouble/difficulty doing' becomes -e:- of teke:vnnaka 'have trouble recognizing/seeing'\n\nIn [[syllable]]s reduced through [[morphophonology|morphophonetic]] processes, terminal vowels (-a, -u:) of original bisyllables will often drop (except for -i, which tends to remain, leaving previous material unaffected), and resultant final stops will fricativize (r becomes sh). Aside from losing stress, any vowels preceding these shifted consonants will often shift from tense to lax. Ex. -a:gu: 'for self, with one's own' > -ax-. ata 'to take, convey' > vhr-, and so on. [[Present tense]] usually results in the dropping of the final vowel of the [[infinitive|infinitival]] form of the [[verb]] and associated changes as above, as does affixation by many, but not all, further [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] and [[inflection]]al [[suffix]]es beginning with [[stop consonant|stops]], [[affricate]]s, and other consonants. Ex. aiamaka 'to fight' aiamux-tvlli 'to fight confusedly'.\n\nThe sounds m, n, and l are particularly labile in some environments. atama 'to eat' atu:-yella 'to leave off eating' (not atamayella). n from -Vna 'state' is often reduced to -V: when one would expect -Vn-. lt can disappear entirely before some consonants. vla 'to drink', vlnggu: or vnggu: 'to drink'. Initial h- in roots and affixes drops in many instances. Ex. kvna 'to float, be in boat'+ haina 'to walk, go' gives kvn-aina. ng (as in English 'hang') is purely morphophonetic, from terminal n before a velar consonant. Many instances of m before a labial consonant are similarly motivated. w after a passive/reflexive prefix m- often drops. w often vocalizes to u: or o: or drops (depending on preceding material): tu:- causative plus wvshta:gu: 'work' is tu:vshta:gu: 'make work'. y is also relatively labile- after reduced -ata- > -vhr- the suffix -yella 'to leave off' becomes -chella. In combination with preceding -a y often vocalizes: ki:pa 'woman' plus yamalim 'plural animates/people' becomes ki:paiamalim.\n\n===Stress===\nIn recent analyses of the speech of remaining speakers, [[stress (linguistics)|word stress]] was felt to be [[minimal pair|nondistinctive]]. However, in the mid-19th century Yahga Strait dialect (which is likely not the ancestor of the surviving one) word stress was distinctive at least at the level of the individual [[morpheme]], with stress shifting in regular patterns during word formation. Certain otherwise identical [[root (linguistics)|word roots]] are distinguishable by different stress marking. No information is available about phrase or clause level stress phenomena from the Yahga dialect.\n\nSome roots, particularly those with doubled consonants, exhibit stress on both vowels flanking the doublet. Diphthongs appear to attract stress when they are morphophonetic in origin, sometimes removing it from vowels on both sides that would otherwise be stressed. The first vowel -V- (influenced by the preceding terminal root vowel) in -Vna '(be) in a state' also appears to attract stress, while -ata 'attain' repels stress to the left. Thus the combination -Vnata 'get into a state' is harmonious. Diphthongal attraction often trumps -Vna, drawing stress further left, while two successive diphthongs often have the stress on the rightmost one (counterintuitively). Syllables reduced morphophonetically generally lose whatever stress they might have carried. The vast majority of 'irregular' stress renderings in Bridges' original dictionary manuscript seem to arise from just these five sources.\n\nIt may be that these effects help to preserve morpheme boundary and identity information. For instance given the importance of derivation of verbs from nouns and adjectives using -Vna- and -ata-, shifted stress allows one to differentiate these morphemes from lexical -ata- (common enough) and those -na-'s that are part of lexical roots (also relatively common). -Vna itself  will often lose stress and reduce to a tense vowel before other suffixes, leaving the shifting as a hint of its underlying presence.\n\nStress can also differentiate otherwise identical voice morpheme strings: t\u00fa:mu:- causative reflexive (get someone else to do/make one) from tu:m\u00fa:-(1) the causative of making oneself seem, or pretend to be in some state, and tu:m\u00fa:-(2) the circumstantial (tu:- allomorph before m-) of same (i.e. to seem/pretend at any specified time or place, with any particular tools, for any reasons, etc.). Circumstantial T has different allomorphs- some having following stressable vowel, others not- this also complicates matters for the learner but may also help disentangle morpheme boundaries for the listener.\n\n===Sound symbolism===\nThere appears to be a great deal of remnant sound symbolism in the Yahgan lexicon. For example, many roots ending in -m encode as part of their senses the notion of a texturally softened positive curve (similar to -mp in such words as lump or hump in English), while an -l in similar position often shows up when the reference is to bloody core parts, often out from once safe confinement inside the body. Many roots with initial ch- refer to repeated, spiny extrusions, final -x to dry, hard-edged, or brittle parts, and so on.\n\nThe historical sources of these patterns cannot be known for sure, but it may be possible that there was at one time a shape and texture classifier system of some sort behind them. Such systems are rather common in South American languages.\n\nThere is little direct onomatopoeia recorded by Bridges, despite descriptions of highly animated imitative behavior on the part of speakers being recorded in the late 19th century. Several bird names are perhaps reduplications of calls (or other nonvocal behavior), and there are a couple of imitative cries and sound words. Most words denoting sounds end in an unproductive verb-deriving suffix -sha (in at least one case -ra, and r is known to alternate with sh), which may be derived from the Yahgan root ha:sha 'voice, language, uttered words, speech, cry', or vra 'to cry' \u2014 e.g. ''gvlasha'' 'to rattle'.\n\nIn the Bridges dictionary of the language one may note several otherwise identical terms differing only in whether they are spelled with an s or a ch \u2014 e.g. asela/achela 'skin'. It is not known whether this was dialectal, dialect mixture, ideolectal, gender-based usage or a real grammatical variation such as might occur with augmentative/diminutive sound symbolic shifting.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Syntax===\nYahgan exhibits extensive case marking on nouns and equally extensive voice marking on verbs. Because of this, word order is relatively less important in determining subject and object relations. Most of the clauses in the three published biblical texts, the dictionary, and the various grammars show either verb medial or verb final orders. Certain clause types are verb initial, but are the distinct minority.\n\nFurther analysis of the biblical texts is showing that the Yahga dialect allowed for semantic reordering of constituents. For instance if SVO is considered the default order for subject and object flanking the verb, then when O is left-shifted (SOV) there is often a sense that the object nominal has more say in his/her patient-hood than if kept to the right of the verb. Similarly, when the subject is right-shifted (VSO) its agent-hood appears often less than what one would expect. It will remain to be seen how pervasive this principle is in the language, and how intricately it interacts with Tense-Aspect-Mood and Polarity marking, topicalization, focus, etc.\n\nThe adverb kaia 'fast, quick(ly)' can be used lexically to modify predications, but in the three biblical texts it is also apparently used to mark the second component clause in 'if-then' types of constructions. There is no mention made of this in surviving grammars, nor in the dictionary glosses of kaia. The progressive verb suffix -gaiata may be related.\n\n===Grammaticalization===\nGrammaticalization is an historical linguistic process whereby regular lexical items shift function (and sometimes form) and become part of the grammar structure.\n\nAn example of this in Yahgan would be the change of posture verbs into aspectual markers. Yahgan has a system of verbs which denote the posture of an entity: 'stand' mvni, 'sit' mu:tu:, 'lie' (w)i:a and others (for instance a:gulu: 'fly/jump', kvna 'float' etc.). In normal lexical usage one could say\n\nhai ha-mu:t-ude: 'I sat'. (hai full pronoun first person singular, ha- bound version unmarked for number, -ude: past tense).\n\nsa sa-mvni-de: 'You stood'. (sa full pronoun second singular, sa- bound).\n\nBut with the same root in their grammaticalized forms added:\n\nhai ha-mvni-mu:t-ude: 'I stood regularly, or as a rule'.\n\nsa sa-muhr-mvni-de: 'You often sat, or were ready to sit'.\n\nThe semantic bases of such usage seems to the degree of bodily contact with the substratum, vigilance, engagement, etc. Flying/jumping means ceasing some activity of interest entirely and going off to do something else rather suddenly, standing implies readiness to do something else as needed but attending to the activity when one can. Sitting is regular involvement in the activity, though not to the exclusion of other things that need doing. Lying (not just on but also within) is deep involvement, almost to the exclusion of other activities (English 'immersed in', being 'wrapped up in', 'in a rut' 'be up to one's neck/ears in', 'in over one's head', 'buried in (as work)' etc. have similar import). Relative height is another way to look at it- we say we are 'over' with something to mean 'done with' (equivalent to the jump/fly term in Yahgan), with a hint of relative dominance implied as well. While English has a plethora of colorful expressions for denoting such circumstances, Yahgan has reduced the system to a well defined smallish set of terms from the domain of posture verbs. Such reduction is one symptom of grammaticalization.\n\nSuch contact/engagement-based semantic clines are relatively common crosslinguistically, and the phenomenon of posture verbs changing to aspect marking morphemes is well known among linguists, though it is not the only pathway to creating such terms.\n\nA phonetically based cline (based on both oral articulatory position and manner) can be seen in prefixes y- a- u:- in Yahgan, and combinations ya- and u:a-.\n\ny- denotes an activity begun or intended, but not completed. a- seems to imply continuation, and u:- removal of impediments to the completion of the activity. Combined forms ya- and u:a- appear to accentuate the continuous part of the activity.\n\nIn North America, languages of the Siouan and Chemakuan families have similarly structured basic systems (Siouan prefixal, Chemakuan suffixal), but mostly with spatial reference. i- is standing out, away from some surface, a- is surface contact, and u- is containment within a surface, though there are also processual and figure/ground senses involved. Note that standing away minimizes surface contact. Other language families have distance demonstratives which follow similar phonological clines. It is possible that there may be historical connections between the y- form and ki:pa 'woman' and u:- and u:a 'man', which when verbalized apparently refer to less and more forceful or determined attempts to achieve respectively. Verbs ya:na 'to intend, wish' and wa:na 'pass, surpass', as well as u:a- 'do fiercely, forcibly' may be related, with suffixal -na on the first forms.\n\nHorizontal movement verbs commonly change, crosslinguistically, into tense markers. Yahgan shows evidence of such shifts as well.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe three personal pronoun bases are: h- first person/proximal, s- second person/near distal, k- third person/further distal. These are also the forms found as bound prefixes on verbs.\n\nFree/emphatic forms: Nominative Singular: 1 hai, 2 sa, 3 kvnjin.\nDual: 1 hipai, 2 sapai, 3 kvnde:(i) or kvnde:u:. Plural: 1 haian, 2 san, 3 kvndaian\n\nAccusative Singular: 1 haia, 2 skaia, 3 kvnjima. Dual: 123. Plural: 1 haiananima, 2 sananima, 3 kvndaiananima.\n\n===Demonstratives===\nThe demonstrative bases are the same historically as those of the pronouns:\n* hauan: 'here'\n* hauanchi: 'this'\n* siu:an: 'there (close)'\n* siu:anchi: 'that (close)'\n* kvnji: 'that (further away)'\n\n===Adjectives===\nYahgan possesses a large number of adjective roots, especially those referring to physical states of matter, health, psychological states, etc. Many do double duty as nouns, adverbs, less often without derivation as verbs. Nouns and adjectives can be verbalized by adding -Vna '(be) in a state', or -ata 'become' or both -Vnata 'develop into a state' (where the identity of V is influenced by the final vowel of the root, but is often not identical to it). Such verbalizations are exceedingly common in the dictionary, and can be further derived and inflected.\n\nExample: lvmbi 'dark, black', lvmbi:na 'be dark', lvmbi:nata 'become dark', lvmbi:nuhrka:taka 'incrementally become dark', tu:lvmbi:nuhrchella 'cause to leave off becoming dark'.\n\nAdjectives in Yahgan generally have predicative value when following a noun, but are attributive when preceding. There are large numbers of adjective-noun compounds in the language. Examples of attributive adjectives preceding the noun: yaus-u:a 'a lying man, i.e. a liar', yaus-ki:pa 'a lying woman', yeka-kaiiu:ala 'a young child', hu:lu:-a:nan 'a large canoe'. Examples of predicative adjectives following a noun: lvn-tauwa 'tight-tongued i.e. tongue-tied', yvsh-duf 'weak-handed i.e. not dexterous'.\n\nSome more commonly used suffixal forms creating adjectives are: -kuru: 'wishing, wanting to X', -pun 'having no ability to resist X'ing', -Vta 'disposed towards X(ing)', -vnnaka 'having difficulty Xing or unable to X', -a:ru:gata 'troubled doing X', -siu:wa:ta 'tired of X or Xing', -Vtas 'doing X well'. Examples: a:musha:kuru: 'liking to pray', u:ku:tu:mvra-siu:wa:ta 'tired of explaining', i:kama:natas 'good at writing'. As with other adjective roots, these suffixed forms may be further derived as in the lvmbi example above.\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs are the one word class that appears to allow for productive reduplication, for instance chilla 'again', chilla chilla 'again and again'.\n\n===Nouns===\nThe physical environment in which the Yahgan people lived was relatively poor in land resources, and historically they spent little time in the interior. It is understandable, then, that the vocabulary reflects this. There are many fewer names for land animals and plants than one might expect based on what is found in other languages from other, richer natural environments. The sea coast was a different matter, and the language had many terms for sea birds and ocean life.\n\nYahgan emphasized interconnected parts over unanalyzed wholes (also reflected in their verb serialization). Body parts are finely differentiated, as are social relationships. The vocabulary contained a vast number of deverbalized nouns.\n\nPersonal names often derived from the name of the place of birth- for instance a man born in Ushuaia (meaning 'bay (waia) in the upper back (ushsha)') might be Ushuaia-njiz. Alternatively one might use the case form -ndaulum 'from' and u:a 'man' giving Ushuaia-ndaulum-u:a.\n\nSubject nouns take no overt case marking (subject coreference is on the verb instead). Nouns can be marked for accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and other cases. Geographical information can be incorporated into the string, as can information about number, collectivity, definiteness, etc. Most of these marks are suffixal.\n\nIn the three biblical texts there are numerous complex noun phrases with very involved case relations. It is unknown whether this is characteristic of speaker usage or an invention of the missionary Bridges.\n\nVerbs can be nominalized through a variety of means, particularly by the prefixation of circumstantial T (with its various allomorphs) and/or suffixation of participial morphemes: -shin 'past participle', -(k)un 'present participle', and -Vmvs 'future participle'. Examples: ts-ta:gu: 'to give at some particular time, in some stated place, using some tool', or 'a gift', teki-shin 'when X saw, or the one who saw', wvle:wa twi:amanana-shin 'The boy who lived', ts-ta:pvn-a:mvs 'the one who will die'.\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs in Yahgan are often [[compound (linguistics)|compounded]] (\"[[serial verb construction|serialized]]\"). Bound subject pronouns (ha- 1st, sa- 2nd, kv- 3rd), unmarked for number, are prefixed, coming before voice prefixes (such as ma(m) -passive, tu:- causative, u:- permissive, T- circumstantial (with allomorphs t-, {{not a typo|tv-}}, tu:-, ts-, chi:-, chi-, ch-), l- back, in response to, etc.). Aspect (such as progressive -gaiata-), tense (for instance -vde: simple past, -u:a simple future, with added increments -vde:aka 'further past', -u:ana 'further future), and mood (generally in that order), etc. are suffixal, along with the two 'benefactive' suffixes -a:gu: 'for self', -ya:gu: 'for another'. Number within the verb (number of subjects or acts) can be encoded by overt marking (once -ata, twice -a:pai/-pikin-, several times -a:misiu:, plural -isin-/-u:sin-, or even none -apisiu:) or the many different distinct plural verbs (for instance mvni 'sg.  to stand', palana 'pl. to stand'; ata 'sg. to take, convey', tu:mi:na 'pl. to take, convey').\n\nEx. i:nan haian kvndaiananima ha-ts-tu:-uhr-gaiat-u:sin-de:-aka a:nan  'We (haian) were making them (kvndaiananima) take (uhr < ata 'take') the boat (a:nan) during (ts- circumstantial plus -n locative on) the winter (i:na) a while ago'.\n\nA handful of verbs form doublets where one of the pair seems to have an unproductive reversative suffix possibly related to the form -a:gu: '(do) for oneself'. For instance ma:na 'to lend', ma:na:ku: 'to borrow'.\n\nIn addition to normal serialization Yahgan also exhibits complex verb stems of a type relatively common in western North America, where the main verb is flanked by instrument/body part manner of action prefixes and pathway/position suffixes. The prefixes are part of a larger, more open system of elements marking various kinds of causes or motivations, grading off into more grammaticalized voice marking. Many of the path/position suffixes (especially posture verbs) do double duty as sources for more grammaticalized aspectual morphology. Tense suffixes seem to derive historically from horizontal motion verbs, and together with the more vertical postural aspect forms, make an interesting Cartesian-style coordinate system for dealing with the temporal dimension.\n\nExample stems are: -aku:-pung-kvna-, -aku:- 'by striking' (itself from aki 'strike' plus -u:- permissive/causative), -(a)pvna-'kill/die', -kvna 'in a boat or afloat', meaning 'to kill by striking while afloat'. -alagvnat-u:-tekil-uhr-man-a:tsikvri- 'to stand by watching (-alagvnat-) and let (-u:) step completely (-tekil-ata-) out (-man-a:tsikvri-) (say a person one does not like out of the house into the line of gunfire without warning or stopping him).\n\nA small number of commonly used verb roots have irregular present tenses. Instead of dropping the final vowel (triggering reductive processes) these forms instead add -ata after the vowel is dropped. Examples: mu:tu: 'to sit'/'to be', present mu:ta (from mu:t-ata), wi:a 'to lie'/'to be', present wi:ata, kvna 'to float'/'to be', present ga:rata. In the last example note that this seemingly suppletive present may in fact hark back to the original historical form, and infinitival kvna may be the changed one.\n\nThe form mvra 'to hear' has grammaticalized into an evidential suffix -mush 'hearsay'. Ex. hauanchi isin wuru: yamanaiamalim ma:maia-mushun-de: 'They say that in this land many men died'. There are several other evidential suffixes, differentiating sensory mode (hearing, sight, etc.) as well as time. mvra also finds modal use in the clitic space that often follows the first substantive in the sentence: kvnjin MUSH yamana:mu:ta, kvndaian-da:gia kv-teki-sin-de: kvnjima hauanchi moala 'He MUST be alive, because they (the ones who told me about it) saw him today'. There are other modal verbs also found in this space.\n\nThere is little or no reduplication evident on the Yahgan verb, and sound symbolism of the augmentative/diminutive type appears to be largely lexicalized. On the other hand, Yahgan exhibits a good deal of remnant sound symbolism in the verb, similar to what one sees in English.\n\nA good number of verbs seem to form small 'word families' which have slight semantic differences which may have been encoded using sound symbolism (as one often sees, for instance, in some languages of the Austroasiatic stock). For instance haina 'go, walk lightly' versus u:unna 'walk heavily, plod'. In such cases the original symmetry of form seems often to have been distorted by historical changes.\n\n== Alphabet ==\nThe [[alphabet]] currently sanctioned officially in Chile is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uchile.cl/cultura/lenguas/yaganes/alfabeto.html |title=Alfabeto Lengua Yag\u00e1n |publisher=Uchile.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>\n\na, \u00e6, ch, e, \u00f6, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, rh, s, \u0161, t, u, w, x.\n\nA simplified [[orthography]] is a variant of the old Bridges system, created for online use on the Waata Chis discussion list on [[Yahoo Groups]]<ref>Tauber, Jess. [https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/waata_chis/conversations/messages/8 \u201c8 - Yahgan Orthography for the list\u201d]. 24 April 2004. Retrieved on 04 abril 2017.</ref> and elsewhere. It has tense and lax vowels as well as voiced and voiceless consonants. In the system, [[tenseness]] is marked by colon (:) following the vowel sign: a, a:, ai, au, e, e:, i, i:, iu:, o, o:, oi, u, u:, v (pronounced as a schwa, not {{IPA|/v/}}), all corresponding to unique graphemes in the Bridges orthography. The consonants are b, d, ch, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ng, p, r, s, sh, t, w, x, y, z, all corresponding to unique Bridges  graphemes. Some are found only in restricted environments. The phonemes hm, hn, hl, hr, hw, and hy are used as well, and are digraphs in the earlier Bridges writings, but single graphemes in later ones.\n\nStill later, Bridges made further orthographic modifications: w, h, and y became superscripts, and \u00e0 is read as ya, \u00e1 as ha, and \u0101 as wa. Superscripts could combine to give hw, hy, etc. Because iu: could now be represented by u: plus y- superscript (\u00f9:), and because the original [[grapheme]]s for u: and u were easily confused with each other as well as with the now-superscripted w, Bridges began using the now-redundant grapheme for iu: (approximately \u0173) for u: in his renderings. All of these changes took place in a very short time frame, and have led to substantial confusion on the part of later scholars.\n\nIn addition, Bridges's modifications of the 19th century phonetic alphabet of Alexander Ellis also included a number of signs meant for transliterations of foreign terms.\n\nThere are some ambiguities in Bridges' renderings. He himself notes that g/k, j/ch, d/t and p/f are, in many instances, interchangeable. In certain environments s and sh are hard to distinguish (as before high front vowels). The same goes for ai versus e: and au versus o:. Such ambiguities may go far to help explain the loss or lack of contrasts in the surviving dialect.\n\n===Pronunciation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Letters A \u2013 M\n!A\n!\u00c6\n!Ch/\u010c\n!E\n!\u00d6/\u01cd\n!F\n!H\n!I\n!J/Y\n!K\n!L\n!M\n|-\n|Pronounced\n|a\n|\u00e6\n|t\u0283e\n|e\n|\u0259 pejpi\n|ef\n|ha\n|i\n|jot\n|ka\n|el\n|em\n|-\n|IPA sound\n|a\n|\u00e6\n|t\u0283\n|e\n|\u0259\n|f\n|h\n|i\n|j\n|k\n|l\n|m\n|-\n|Example word\n|'''\u00c1'''nan\n|M'''\u00e6'''pi\n|'''\u010c'''\u00edli\n|'''E'''k\u00f3le\n|L'''\u01ce'''m\n|Ta'''f'''l\u00e1\n|'''H'''alaj\u00e9lla\n|'''\u00cd'''lan\n|'''J'''e\u010d\u00e9la\n|'''K'''ulu\u00e1na\n|'''L'''ufki\u00e9\n|'''M'''as\u00e1kon\n|-\n|IPA pronunciation\n|\u00e1nan\n|m\u00e6pi\n|t\u0283\u00edli\n|ek\u00f3le\n|l\u0258m\n|tafl\u00e1\n|halaj\u00e9l\u02d0a\n|\u00edlan\n|jet\u0283\u00e9la\n|kulu\u00e1na\n|lufki\u00e9\n|mas\u00e1kon\n|-\n|English meaning\n|Canoe\n|Jonquil <br/> (''rush daffodil'')\n|Wave\n|One\n|Sun\n|Fat\n|I leave you <br/>(''farewell'')\n|Southern<br/>wind\n|Dog\n|Grandma\n|Owl\n|Father-in-law\n|-\n|Spanish meaning\n|Canoa\n|Junquillo\n|Ola\n|Uno\n|Sol\n|Gordo\n|Los dejo\n|Viento sur\n|Perro\n|Abuela\n|Lechuza\n|Suegro\n|+\n!Letters N \u2013 X\n!N\n!O\n!P\n!R/Rr\n!Rh\n!\u0158\n!S\n!\u0160\n!T\n!U\n!W\n!X\n|-\n|Pronounced\n|en\n|o\n|pe\n|ar\n|e\u0279\n|\u0279\u0283\n|es\n|\u0255a\n|te\n|u\n|w\u00e1u\n|xa\n|-\n|IPA sound\n|n\n|o\n|p\n|\u0279\n|r\n|\u0279\u0283\n|s\n|\u0255\n|t\n|u\n|w\n|x\n|-\n|Example word\n|'''N'''\u00edtral \n|'''O'''fk\u00eds\n|'''P'''u\u0161aki\n|K\u00e1'''rr'''po\n|W\u00e1'''rh'''o\n|\u00c1ka'''\u0159'''\n|'''S'''\u00edma\n|'''\u0160'''\u00fa\u0161a\n|'''T'''ape\u00e1\n|'''U'''ma\u0161am\u00e1i\n|'''W'''il\u00f3ila\n|'''X'''\u00edxa\n|-\n|IPA pronunciation\n|nitr\u00e1l\n|ofk\u00eds\n|pu\u0255aki\n|k\u00e1\u0279po\n|w\u00e1ro\n|\u00e1ka\u0279\u0283\n|s\u00edma\n|\u0255\u00fa\u0255a\n|tape\u00e1\n|uma\u0255am\u00e1i\n|wil\u00f3ila\n|x\u00edxa\n|-\n|English Meaning\n|Needle\n|Ears\n|Wood\n|Cormorant\n|Cave\n|House,<br/>hut,<br/>tent\n|Water\n|Penguin\n|Mom\n|Barberry\n|Skua\n|Canal\n|-\n|Spanish Meaning\n|Aguja\n|Orejas\n|Le\u00f1a\n|Cormor\u00e1n\n|Cueva\n|Casa,<br/>choza,<br/>carpa\n|Agua\n|Ping\u00fcino\n|Mam\u00e1\n|Calafate\n|Salteador\n|Canal\n|}\n<ref>[https://issuu.com/annakoelle/docs/y_gankuta__independiente_]</ref>\n\n==Sample vocabulary==\nIncluded below are some basic Yaghan words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serindigena.org/territorios/yagan/len_yam1.htm |title=Pueblos Originarios \u2013 Territorio Yag\u00e1n |publisher=SerIndigena |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Yamana-English, a Dictionary of the speech of Tierra del Fuego, by the Reverend Thomas Bridges, ... edited by Dr. Ferdinand Hestermann and Dr. Martin Gusinde.|last=Bridges|first=Thomas|last2=Gusinde|first2=Martin|last3=Hestermann|first3=Ferdinand|date=1933|publisher=Missionsdruckerei St. Gabriel|location=(M\u00f6dling|language=English|oclc=458712562}}</ref>\n\n*man: yagan, y\u00e1mana (Bridges ya:gan, yamana)\n*woman: k\u00edppa (Bridges ki:pa)\n*dog: ya\u0161\u00e1la, je\u0161\u00e6la (Bridges yvshvla (v schwa))\n*blood: s\u00e1pa (Bridges sa:pa)\n*arm: kam\u00e9in, kam\u00e6n (Bridges ka:main)\n*heart: s\u00e1eskin, s\u00e6skin (Bridges svskin)\n*moon: han\u00faha, han\u00faxa (Bridges hannu:ka)\n*star: ahp\u00e9rnih, ap\u00e6rnix (Bridges apvranix)\n*rain: pal\u00e9na (Bridges belakana)\n*water: s\u00edma (Bridges sima)\n*fog: f\u00f3ka, h\u00e1oka (Bridges hauaka, also 'cloud')\n*sky: w\u00e1kul (Bridges wa:gun)\n*fire: pu\u0161\u00e1ki (Bridges pushaki)\n*ash: \u00e1fua, axu\u00e1, ahu\u00e1 (Bridges vfwa, vxwa, vhwa)\n*day: ma\u00f3la, m\u00f3lla (Bridges mo:ala)\n*bay, inlet: ushipin (Bridges waia, here likely for ushuwaia)\n*canoe: \u00e1nan (Bridges a:nan)\n*vulva: wahar (Bridges wa:kvri 'bladder', but la:kasha 'the purse', which is a 19th century English avoidance term for the female genitalia- the two terms may be related, as r often alternated with sh))\n\n===Loukotka (1968)===\n[[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for four Yamana (Yaghan) dialects.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! gloss !!

The oldest analysis is from the 19th century (prephonological era), by [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]] (1894); from the middle of the 20th century Haudricourt (1952) and Holmer (1953); and towards the end of the 20th century, the last phonological studies were made on this moribund language by Guerra Eissmann (1990), Salas y Valencia (1990), and Aguilera (2000).\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

For instance, the terminal -i of teki 'to see, recognize' when [[affix]]ed by -vnnaka 'to have trouble/difficulty doing' becomes -e:- of teke:vnnaka 'have trouble recognizing/seeing'\n\nIn [[syllable]]s reduced through [[morphophonology|morphophonetic]] processes, terminal vowels (-a, -u:) of original bisyllables will often drop (except for -i, which tends to remain, leaving previous material unaffected), and resultant final stops will fricativize (r becomes sh). Aside from losing stress, any vowels preceding these shifted consonants will often shift from tense to lax. Ex. -a:gu: 'for self, with one's own' > -ax-. ata 'to take, convey' > vhr-, and so on. [[Present tense]] usually results in the dropping of the final vowel of the [[infinitive|infinitival]] form of the [[verb]] and associated changes as above, as does affixation by many, but not all, further [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] and [[inflection]]al [[suffix]]es beginning with [[stop consonant|stops]], [[affricate]]s, and other consonants. Ex. aiamaka 'to fight' aiamux-tvlli 'to fight confusedly'.\n\nThe sounds m, n, and l are particularly labile in some environments. atama 'to eat' atu:-yella 'to leave off eating' (not atamayella). n from -Vna 'state' is often reduced to -V: when one would expect -Vn-. lt can disappear entirely before some consonants. vla 'to drink', vlnggu: or vnggu: 'to drink'. Initial h- in roots and affixes drops in many instances. Ex. kvna 'to float, be in boat'+ haina 'to walk, go' gives kvn-aina. ng (as in English 'hang') is purely morphophonetic, from terminal n before a velar consonant. Many instances of m before a labial consonant are similarly motivated. w after a passive/reflexive prefix m- often drops. w often vocalizes to u: or o: or drops (depending on preceding material): tu:- causative plus wvshta:gu: 'work' is tu:vshta:gu: 'make work'. y is also relatively labile- after reduced -ata- > -vhr- the suffix -yella 'to leave off' becomes -chella. In combination with preceding -a y often vocalizes: ki:pa 'woman' plus yamalim 'plural animates/people' becomes ki:paiamalim.\n\n===Stress===\nIn recent analyses of the speech of remaining speakers, [[stress (linguistics)|word stress]] was felt to be [[minimal pair|nondistinctive]]. However, in the mid-19th century Yahga Strait dialect (which is likely not the ancestor of the surviving one) word stress was distinctive at least at the level of the individual [[morpheme]], with stress shifting in regular patterns during word formation. Certain otherwise identical [[root (linguistics)|word roots]] are distinguishable by different stress marking. No information is available about phrase or clause level stress phenomena from the Yahga dialect.\n\nSome roots, particularly those with doubled consonants, exhibit stress on both vowels flanking the doublet. Diphthongs appear to attract stress when they are morphophonetic in origin, sometimes removing it from vowels on both sides that would otherwise be stressed. The first vowel -V- (influenced by the preceding terminal root vowel) in -Vna '(be) in a state' also appears to attract stress, while -ata 'attain' repels stress to the left. Thus the combination -Vnata 'get into a state' is harmonious. Diphthongal attraction often trumps -Vna, drawing stress further left, while two successive diphthongs often have the stress on the rightmost one (counterintuitively). Syllables reduced morphophonetically generally lose whatever stress they might have carried. The vast majority of 'irregular' stress renderings in Bridges' original dictionary manuscript seem to arise from just these five sources.\n\nIt may be that these effects help to preserve morpheme boundary and identity information. For instance given the importance of derivation of verbs from nouns and adjectives using -Vna- and -ata-, shifted stress allows one to differentiate these morphemes from lexical -ata- (common enough) and those -na-'s that are part of lexical roots (also relatively common). -Vna itself  will often lose stress and reduce to a tense vowel before other suffixes, leaving the shifting as a hint of its underlying presence.\n\nStress can also differentiate otherwise identical voice morpheme strings: t\u00fa:mu:- causative reflexive (get someone else to do/make one) from tu:m\u00fa:-(1) the causative of making oneself seem, or pretend to be in some state, and tu:m\u00fa:-(2) the circumstantial (tu:- allomorph before m-) of same (i.e. to seem/pretend at any specified time or place, with any particular tools, for any reasons, etc.). Circumstantial T has different allomorphs- some having following stressable vowel, others not- this also complicates matters for the learner but may also help disentangle morpheme boundaries for the listener.\n\n===Sound symbolism===\nThere appears to be a great deal of remnant sound symbolism in the Yahgan lexicon. For example, many roots ending in -m encode as part of their senses the notion of a texturally softened positive curve (similar to -mp in such words as lump or hump in English), while an -l in similar position often shows up when the reference is to bloody core parts, often out from once safe confinement inside the body. Many roots with initial ch- refer to repeated, spiny extrusions, final -x to dry, hard-edged, or brittle parts, and so on.\n\nThe historical sources of these patterns cannot be known for sure, but it may be possible that there was at one time a shape and texture classifier system of some sort behind them. Such systems are rather common in South American languages.\n\nThere is little direct onomatopoeia recorded by Bridges, despite descriptions of highly animated imitative behavior on the part of speakers being recorded in the late 19th century. Several bird names are perhaps reduplications of calls (or other nonvocal behavior), and there are a couple of imitative cries and sound words. Most words denoting sounds end in an unproductive verb-deriving suffix -sha (in at least one case -ra, and r is known to alternate with sh), which may be derived from the Yahgan root ha:sha 'voice, language, uttered words, speech, cry', or vra 'to cry' \u2014 e.g. ''gvlasha'' 'to rattle'.\n\nIn the Bridges dictionary of the language one may note several otherwise identical terms differing only in whether they are spelled with an s or a ch \u2014 e.g. asela/achela 'skin'. It is not known whether this was dialectal, dialect mixture, ideolectal, gender-based usage or a real grammatical variation such as might occur with augmentative/diminutive sound symbolic shifting.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Syntax===\nYahgan exhibits extensive case marking on nouns and equally extensive voice marking on verbs. Because of this, word order is relatively less important in determining subject and object relations. Most of the clauses in the three published biblical texts, the dictionary, and the various grammars show either verb medial or verb final orders. Certain clause types are verb initial, but are the distinct minority.\n\nFurther analysis of the biblical texts is showing that the Yahga dialect allowed for semantic reordering of constituents. For instance if SVO is considered the default order for subject and object flanking the verb, then when O is left-shifted (SOV) there is often a sense that the object nominal has more say in his/her patient-hood than if kept to the right of the verb. Similarly, when the subject is right-shifted (VSO) its agent-hood appears often less than what one would expect. It will remain to be seen how pervasive this principle is in the language, and how intricately it interacts with Tense-Aspect-Mood and Polarity marking, topicalization, focus, etc.\n\nThe adverb kaia 'fast, quick(ly)' can be used lexically to modify predications, but in the three biblical texts it is also apparently used to mark the second component clause in 'if-then' types of constructions. There is no mention made of this in surviving grammars, nor in the dictionary glosses of kaia. The progressive verb suffix -gaiata may be related.\n\n===Grammaticalization===\nGrammaticalization is an historical linguistic process whereby regular lexical items shift function (and sometimes form) and become part of the grammar structure.\n\nAn example of this in Yahgan would be the change of posture verbs into aspectual markers. Yahgan has a system of verbs which denote the posture of an entity: 'stand' mvni, 'sit' mu:tu:, 'lie' (w)i:a and others (for instance a:gulu: 'fly/jump', kvna 'float' etc.). In normal lexical usage one could say\n\nhai ha-mu:t-ude: 'I sat'. (hai full pronoun first person singular, ha- bound version unmarked for number, -ude: past tense).\n\nsa sa-mvni-de: 'You stood'. (sa full pronoun second singular, sa- bound).\n\nBut with the same root in their grammaticalized forms added:\n\nhai ha-mvni-mu:t-ude: 'I stood regularly, or as a rule'.\n\nsa sa-muhr-mvni-de: 'You often sat, or were ready to sit'.\n\nThe semantic bases of such usage seems to the degree of bodily contact with the substratum, vigilance, engagement, etc. Flying/jumping means ceasing some activity of interest entirely and going off to do something else rather suddenly, standing implies readiness to do something else as needed but attending to the activity when one can. Sitting is regular involvement in the activity, though not to the exclusion of other things that need doing. Lying (not just on but also within) is deep involvement, almost to the exclusion of other activities (English 'immersed in', being 'wrapped up in', 'in a rut' 'be up to one's neck/ears in', 'in over one's head', 'buried in (as work)' etc. have similar import). Relative height is another way to look at it- we say we are 'over' with something to mean 'done with' (equivalent to the jump/fly term in Yahgan), with a hint of relative dominance implied as well. While English has a plethora of colorful expressions for denoting such circumstances, Yahgan has reduced the system to a well defined smallish set of terms from the domain of posture verbs. Such reduction is one symptom of grammaticalization.\n\nSuch contact/engagement-based semantic clines are relatively common crosslinguistically, and the phenomenon of posture verbs changing to aspect marking morphemes is well known among linguists, though it is not the only pathway to creating such terms.\n\nA phonetically based cline (based on both oral articulatory position and manner) can be seen in prefixes y- a- u:- in Yahgan, and combinations ya- and u:a-.\n\ny- denotes an activity begun or intended, but not completed. a- seems to imply continuation, and u:- removal of impediments to the completion of the activity. Combined forms ya- and u:a- appear to accentuate the continuous part of the activity.\n\nIn North America, languages of the Siouan and Chemakuan families have similarly structured basic systems (Siouan prefixal, Chemakuan suffixal), but mostly with spatial reference. i- is standing out, away from some surface, a- is surface contact, and u- is containment within a surface, though there are also processual and figure/ground senses involved. Note that standing away minimizes surface contact. Other language families have distance demonstratives which follow similar phonological clines. It is possible that there may be historical connections between the y- form and ki:pa 'woman' and u:- and u:a 'man', which when verbalized apparently refer to less and more forceful or determined attempts to achieve respectively. Verbs ya:na 'to intend, wish' and wa:na 'pass, surpass', as well as u:a- 'do fiercely, forcibly' may be related, with suffixal -na on the first forms.\n\nHorizontal movement verbs commonly change, crosslinguistically, into tense markers. Yahgan shows evidence of such shifts as well.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe three personal pronoun bases are: h- first person/proximal, s- second person/near distal, k- third person/further distal. These are also the forms found as bound prefixes on verbs.\n\nFree/emphatic forms: Nominative Singular: 1 hai, 2 sa, 3 kvnjin.\nDual: 1 hipai, 2 sapai, 3 kvnde:(i) or kvnde:u:. Plural: 1 haian, 2 san, 3 kvndaian\n\nAccusative Singular: 1 haia, 2 skaia, 3 kvnjima. Dual: 123. Plural: 1 haiananima, 2 sananima, 3 kvndaiananima.\n\n===Demonstratives===\nThe demonstrative bases are the same historically as those of the pronouns:\n* hauan: 'here'\n* hauanchi: 'this'\n* siu:an: 'there (close)'\n* siu:anchi: 'that (close)'\n* kvnji: 'that (further away)'\n\n===Adjectives===\nYahgan possesses a large number of adjective roots, especially those referring to physical states of matter, health, psychological states, etc. Many do double duty as nouns, adverbs, less often without derivation as verbs. Nouns and adjectives can be verbalized by adding -Vna '(be) in a state', or -ata 'become' or both -Vnata 'develop into a state' (where the identity of V is influenced by the final vowel of the root, but is often not identical to it). Such verbalizations are exceedingly common in the dictionary, and can be further derived and inflected.\n\nExample: lvmbi 'dark, black', lvmbi:na 'be dark', lvmbi:nata 'become dark', lvmbi:nuhrka:taka 'incrementally become dark', tu:lvmbi:nuhrchella 'cause to leave off becoming dark'.\n\nAdjectives in Yahgan generally have predicative value when following a noun, but are attributive when preceding. There are large numbers of adjective-noun compounds in the language. Examples of attributive adjectives preceding the noun: yaus-u:a 'a lying man, i.e. a liar', yaus-ki:pa 'a lying woman', yeka-kaiiu:ala 'a young child', hu:lu:-a:nan 'a large canoe'. Examples of predicative adjectives following a noun: lvn-tauwa 'tight-tongued i.e. tongue-tied', yvsh-duf 'weak-handed i.e. not dexterous'.\n\nSome more commonly used suffixal forms creating adjectives are: -kuru: 'wishing, wanting to X', -pun 'having no ability to resist X'ing', -Vta 'disposed towards X(ing)', -vnnaka 'having difficulty Xing or unable to X', -a:ru:gata 'troubled doing X', -siu:wa:ta 'tired of X or Xing', -Vtas 'doing X well'. Examples: a:musha:kuru: 'liking to pray', u:ku:tu:mvra-siu:wa:ta 'tired of explaining', i:kama:natas 'good at writing'. As with other adjective roots, these suffixed forms may be further derived as in the lvmbi example above.\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs are the one word class that appears to allow for productive reduplication, for instance chilla 'again', chilla chilla 'again and again'.\n\n===Nouns===\nThe physical environment in which the Yahgan people lived was relatively poor in land resources, and historically they spent little time in the interior. It is understandable, then, that the vocabulary reflects this. There are many fewer names for land animals and plants than one might expect based on what is found in other languages from other, richer natural environments. The sea coast was a different matter, and the language had many terms for sea birds and ocean life.\n\nYahgan emphasized interconnected parts over unanalyzed wholes (also reflected in their verb serialization). Body parts are finely differentiated, as are social relationships. The vocabulary contained a vast number of deverbalized nouns.\n\nPersonal names often derived from the name of the place of birth- for instance a man born in Ushuaia (meaning 'bay (waia) in the upper back (ushsha)') might be Ushuaia-njiz. Alternatively one might use the case form -ndaulum 'from' and u:a 'man' giving Ushuaia-ndaulum-u:a.\n\nSubject nouns take no overt case marking (subject coreference is on the verb instead). Nouns can be marked for accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and other cases. Geographical information can be incorporated into the string, as can information about number, collectivity, definiteness, etc. Most of these marks are suffixal.\n\nIn the three biblical texts there are numerous complex noun phrases with very involved case relations. It is unknown whether this is characteristic of speaker usage or an invention of the missionary Bridges.\n\nVerbs can be nominalized through a variety of means, particularly by the prefixation of circumstantial T (with its various allomorphs) and/or suffixation of participial morphemes: -shin 'past participle', -(k)un 'present participle', and -Vmvs 'future participle'. Examples: ts-ta:gu: 'to give at some particular time, in some stated place, using some tool', or 'a gift', teki-shin 'when X saw, or the one who saw', wvle:wa twi:amanana-shin 'The boy who lived', ts-ta:pvn-a:mvs 'the one who will die'.\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs in Yahgan are often [[compound (linguistics)|compounded]] (\"[[serial verb construction|serialized]]\"). Bound subject pronouns (ha- 1st, sa- 2nd, kv- 3rd), unmarked for number, are prefixed, coming before voice prefixes (such as ma(m) -passive, tu:- causative, u:- permissive, T- circumstantial (with allomorphs t-, {{not a typo|tv-}}, tu:-, ts-, chi:-, chi-, ch-), l- back, in response to, etc.). Aspect (such as progressive -gaiata-), tense (for instance -vde: simple past, -u:a simple future, with added increments -vde:aka 'further past', -u:ana 'further future), and mood (generally in that order), etc. are suffixal, along with the two 'benefactive' suffixes -a:gu: 'for self', -ya:gu: 'for another'. Number within the verb (number of subjects or acts) can be encoded by overt marking (once -ata, twice -a:pai/-pikin-, several times -a:misiu:, plural -isin-/-u:sin-, or even none -apisiu:) or the many different distinct plural verbs (for instance mvni 'sg.  to stand', palana 'pl. to stand'; ata 'sg. to take, convey', tu:mi:na 'pl. to take, convey').\n\nEx. i:nan haian kvndaiananima ha-ts-tu:-uhr-gaiat-u:sin-de:-aka a:nan  'We (haian) were making them (kvndaiananima) take (uhr < ata 'take') the boat (a:nan) during (ts- circumstantial plus -n locative on) the winter (i:na) a while ago'.\n\nA handful of verbs form doublets where one of the pair seems to have an unproductive reversative suffix possibly related to the form -a:gu: '(do) for oneself'. For instance ma:na 'to lend', ma:na:ku: 'to borrow'.\n\nIn addition to normal serialization Yahgan also exhibits complex verb stems of a type relatively common in western North America, where the main verb is flanked by instrument/body part manner of action prefixes and pathway/position suffixes. The prefixes are part of a larger, more open system of elements marking various kinds of causes or motivations, grading off into more grammaticalized voice marking. Many of the path/position suffixes (especially posture verbs) do double duty as sources for more grammaticalized aspectual morphology. Tense suffixes seem to derive historically from horizontal motion verbs, and together with the more vertical postural aspect forms, make an interesting Cartesian-style coordinate system for dealing with the temporal dimension.\n\nExample stems are: -aku:-pung-kvna-, -aku:- 'by striking' (itself from aki 'strike' plus -u:- permissive/causative), -(a)pvna-'kill/die', -kvna 'in a boat or afloat', meaning 'to kill by striking while afloat'. -alagvnat-u:-tekil-uhr-man-a:tsikvri- 'to stand by watching (-alagvnat-) and let (-u:) step completely (-tekil-ata-) out (-man-a:tsikvri-) (say a person one does not like out of the house into the line of gunfire without warning or stopping him).\n\nA small number of commonly used verb roots have irregular present tenses. Instead of dropping the final vowel (triggering reductive processes) these forms instead add -ata after the vowel is dropped. Examples: mu:tu: 'to sit'/'to be', present mu:ta (from mu:t-ata), wi:a 'to lie'/'to be', present wi:ata, kvna 'to float'/'to be', present ga:rata. In the last example note that this seemingly suppletive present may in fact hark back to the original historical form, and infinitival kvna may be the changed one.\n\nThe form mvra 'to hear' has grammaticalized into an evidential suffix -mush 'hearsay'. Ex. hauanchi isin wuru: yamanaiamalim ma:maia-mushun-de: 'They say that in this land many men died'. There are several other evidential suffixes, differentiating sensory mode (hearing, sight, etc.) as well as time. mvra also finds modal use in the clitic space that often follows the first substantive in the sentence: kvnjin MUSH yamana:mu:ta, kvndaian-da:gia kv-teki-sin-de: kvnjima hauanchi moala 'He MUST be alive, because they (the ones who told me about it) saw him today'. There are other modal verbs also found in this space.\n\nThere is little or no reduplication evident on the Yahgan verb, and sound symbolism of the augmentative/diminutive type appears to be largely lexicalized. On the other hand, Yahgan exhibits a good deal of remnant sound symbolism in the verb, similar to what one sees in English.\n\nA good number of verbs seem to form small 'word families' which have slight semantic differences which may have been encoded using sound symbolism (as one often sees, for instance, in some languages of the Austroasiatic stock). For instance haina 'go, walk lightly' versus u:unna 'walk heavily, plod'. In such cases the original symmetry of form seems often to have been distorted by historical changes.\n\n== Alphabet ==\nThe [[alphabet]] currently sanctioned officially in Chile is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uchile.cl/cultura/lenguas/yaganes/alfabeto.html |title=Alfabeto Lengua Yag\u00e1n |publisher=Uchile.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>\n\na, \u00e6, ch, e, \u00f6, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, rh, s, \u0161, t, u, w, x.\n\nA simplified [[orthography]] is a variant of the old Bridges system, created for online use on the Waata Chis discussion list on [[Yahoo Groups]]<ref>Tauber, Jess. [https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/waata_chis/conversations/messages/8 \u201c8 - Yahgan Orthography for the list\u201d]. 24 April 2004. Retrieved on 04 abril 2017.</ref> and elsewhere. It has tense and lax vowels as well as voiced and voiceless consonants. In the system, [[tenseness]] is marked by colon (:) following the vowel sign: a, a:, ai, au, e, e:, i, i:, iu:, o, o:, oi, u, u:, v (pronounced as a schwa, not {{IPA|/v/}}), all corresponding to unique graphemes in the Bridges orthography. The consonants are b, d, ch, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ng, p, r, s, sh, t, w, x, y, z, all corresponding to unique Bridges  graphemes. Some are found only in restricted environments. The phonemes hm, hn, hl, hr, hw, and hy are used as well, and are digraphs in the earlier Bridges writings, but single graphemes in later ones.\n\nStill later, Bridges made further orthographic modifications: w, h, and y became superscripts, and \u00e0 is read as ya, \u00e1 as ha, and \u0101 as wa. Superscripts could combine to give hw, hy, etc. Because iu: could now be represented by u: plus y- superscript (\u00f9:), and because the original [[grapheme]]s for u: and u were easily confused with each other as well as with the now-superscripted w, Bridges began using the now-redundant grapheme for iu: (approximately \u0173) for u: in his renderings. All of these changes took place in a very short time frame, and have led to substantial confusion on the part of later scholars.\n\nIn addition, Bridges's modifications of the 19th century phonetic alphabet of Alexander Ellis also included a number of signs meant for transliterations of foreign terms.\n\nThere are some ambiguities in Bridges' renderings. He himself notes that g/k, j/ch, d/t and p/f are, in many instances, interchangeable. In certain environments s and sh are hard to distinguish (as before high front vowels). The same goes for ai versus e: and au versus o:. Such ambiguities may go far to help explain the loss or lack of contrasts in the surviving dialect.\n\n===Pronunciation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Letters A \u2013 M\n!A\n!\u00c6\n!Ch/\u010c\n!E\n!\u00d6/\u01cd\n!F\n!H\n!I\n!J/Y\n!K\n!L\n!M\n|-\n|Pronounced\n|a\n|\u00e6\n|t\u0283e\n|e\n|\u0259 pejpi\n|ef\n|ha\n|i\n|jot\n|ka\n|el\n|em\n|-\n|IPA sound\n|a\n|\u00e6\n|t\u0283\n|e\n|\u0259\n|f\n|h\n|i\n|j\n|k\n|l\n|m\n|-\n|Example word\n|'''\u00c1'''nan\n|M'''\u00e6'''pi\n|'''\u010c'''\u00edli\n|'''E'''k\u00f3le\n|L'''\u01ce'''m\n|Ta'''f'''l\u00e1\n|'''H'''alaj\u00e9lla\n|'''\u00cd'''lan\n|'''J'''e\u010d\u00e9la\n|'''K'''ulu\u00e1na\n|'''L'''ufki\u00e9\n|'''M'''as\u00e1kon\n|-\n|IPA pronunciation\n|\u00e1nan\n|m\u00e6pi\n|t\u0283\u00edli\n|ek\u00f3le\n|l\u0258m\n|tafl\u00e1\n|halaj\u00e9l\u02d0a\n|\u00edlan\n|jet\u0283\u00e9la\n|kulu\u00e1na\n|lufki\u00e9\n|mas\u00e1kon\n|-\n|English meaning\n|Canoe\n|Jonquil <br/> (''rush daffodil'')\n|Wave\n|One\n|Sun\n|Fat\n|I leave you <br/>(''farewell'')\n|Southern<br/>wind\n|Dog\n|Grandma\n|Owl\n|Father-in-law\n|-\n|Spanish meaning\n|Canoa\n|Junquillo\n|Ola\n|Uno\n|Sol\n|Gordo\n|Los dejo\n|Viento sur\n|Perro\n|Abuela\n|Lechuza\n|Suegro\n|+\n!Letters N \u2013 X\n!N\n!O\n!P\n!R/Rr\n!Rh\n!\u0158\n!S\n!\u0160\n!T\n!U\n!W\n!X\n|-\n|Pronounced\n|en\n|o\n|pe\n|ar\n|e\u0279\n|\u0279\u0283\n|es\n|\u0255a\n|te\n|u\n|w\u00e1u\n|xa\n|-\n|IPA sound\n|n\n|o\n|p\n|\u0279\n|r\n|\u0279\u0283\n|s\n|\u0255\n|t\n|u\n|w\n|x\n|-\n|Example word\n|'''N'''\u00edtral \n|'''O'''fk\u00eds\n|'''P'''u\u0161aki\n|K\u00e1'''rr'''po\n|W\u00e1'''rh'''o\n|\u00c1ka'''\u0159'''\n|'''S'''\u00edma\n|'''\u0160'''\u00fa\u0161a\n|'''T'''ape\u00e1\n|'''U'''ma\u0161am\u00e1i\n|'''W'''il\u00f3ila\n|'''X'''\u00edxa\n|-\n|IPA pronunciation\n|nitr\u00e1l\n|ofk\u00eds\n|pu\u0255aki\n|k\u00e1\u0279po\n|w\u00e1ro\n|\u00e1ka\u0279\u0283\n|s\u00edma\n|\u0255\u00fa\u0255a\n|tape\u00e1\n|uma\u0255am\u00e1i\n|wil\u00f3ila\n|x\u00edxa\n|-\n|English Meaning\n|Needle\n|Ears\n|Wood\n|Cormorant\n|Cave\n|House,<br/>hut,<br/>tent\n|Water\n|Penguin\n|Mom\n|Barberry\n|Skua\n|Canal\n|-\n|Spanish Meaning\n|Aguja\n|Orejas\n|Le\u00f1a\n|Cormor\u00e1n\n|Cueva\n|Casa,<br/>choza,<br/>carpa\n|Agua\n|Ping\u00fcino\n|Mam\u00e1\n|Calafate\n|Salteador\n|Canal\n|}\n<ref>[https://issuu.com/annakoelle/docs/y_gankuta__independiente_]</ref>\n\n==Sample vocabulary==\nIncluded below are some basic Yaghan words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serindigena.org/territorios/yagan/len_yam1.htm |title=Pueblos Originarios \u2013 Territorio Yag\u00e1n |publisher=SerIndigena |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Yamana-English, a Dictionary of the speech of Tierra del Fuego, by the Reverend Thomas Bridges, ... edited by Dr. Ferdinand Hestermann and Dr. Martin Gusinde.|last=Bridges|first=Thomas|last2=Gusinde|first2=Martin|last3=Hestermann|first3=Ferdinand|date=1933|publisher=Missionsdruckerei St. Gabriel|location=(M\u00f6dling|language=English|oclc=458712562}}</ref>\n\n*man: yagan, y\u00e1mana (Bridges ya:gan, yamana)\n*woman: k\u00edppa (Bridges ki:pa)\n*dog: ya\u0161\u00e1la, je\u0161\u00e6la (Bridges yvshvla (v schwa))\n*blood: s\u00e1pa (Bridges sa:pa)\n*arm: kam\u00e9in, kam\u00e6n (Bridges ka:main)\n*heart: s\u00e1eskin, s\u00e6skin (Bridges svskin)\n*moon: han\u00faha, han\u00faxa (Bridges hannu:ka)\n*star: ahp\u00e9rnih, ap\u00e6rnix (Bridges apvranix)\n*rain: pal\u00e9na (Bridges belakana)\n*water: s\u00edma (Bridges sima)\n*fog: f\u00f3ka, h\u00e1oka (Bridges hauaka, also 'cloud')\n*sky: w\u00e1kul (Bridges wa:gun)\n*fire: pu\u0161\u00e1ki (Bridges pushaki)\n*ash: \u00e1fua, axu\u00e1, ahu\u00e1 (Bridges vfwa, vxwa, vhwa)\n*day: ma\u00f3la, m\u00f3lla (Bridges mo:ala)\n*bay, inlet: ushipin (Bridges waia, here likely for ushuwaia)\n*canoe: \u00e1nan (Bridges a:nan)\n*vulva: wahar (Bridges wa:kvri 'bladder', but la:kasha 'the purse', which is a 19th century English avoidance term for the female genitalia- the two terms may be related, as r often alternated with sh))\n\n===Loukotka (1968)===\n[[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for four Yamana (Yaghan) dialects.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! gloss !!
