It was contested by [[D.C. United]], the two-time reigning champions, and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], the first [[expansion team]] to reach the final. Chicago won the match 2\u20130, with goals from [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] and [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (soccer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]].\n\nChicago became the first expansion team to win the MLS Cup and also was the first MLS club to win both the league championship and the [[U.S. Open Cup]] in a single season, completing a domestic [[double (association football)|double]]. D.C. in turn became the first team to reach three consecutive finals and the first club to fail to score; D.C. also posted the best record in MLS that year with 24 wins (the L.A. Galaxy also won that same number of games), which is also a record that stands today.\n\nAs the top two finishers in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], both D.C. United and Chicago Fire earned the right to represent the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in the [[1999 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]].

United forward [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] threatened early with a shot over Chicago's crossbar within the first minute. Chicago's first goal arrived after 29 minutes, following a quick exchange between Polish international [[Piotr Nowak]] and [[Ante Razov]] just inside the corner of D.C.'s 18-yard box. The move lured United goalkeeper [[Tom Presthus]] off his line, at which point Nowak passed across the box to oncoming Fire midfielder [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] who scored an easy tap-in at the back post. Nowak almost scored a second goal when his 45th minute shot deflected off the body of his teammate, [[Diego Gutierrez (soccer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]]. Nowak was credited with his second assist of the match, and Chicago headed into the second half with all the momentum and maintained the clean sheet on the way to the club's first league championship. [[Chris Armas]] played a significant role in his team's victory by neutralizing the playmaking ability of roaming midfielder [[Marco Etcheverry]], a key ball distributor in United's attack and the league leader in assists that season. MLS Goalkeeper of the Year [[Zach Thornton]] was prolific with 8 saves on the day, including 3 from previous [[MLS Golden Boot]] winner and United's leading scorer, [[Roy Lassiter]].\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date = October 25, 1998\n|time = 15:30 [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]]\n|team1 = [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]\n|score = 2\u20130\n|report= [https://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mls-cup/1998 Report]\n|team2 = [[D.C.

It was contested by [[D.C. United]], the two-time reigning champions, and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], the first [[expansion team]] to reach the final. Chicago won the match 2\u20130, with goals from [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] and [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (soccer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]].\n\nChicago became the first expansion team to win the MLS Cup and also was the first MLS club to win both the league championship and the [[U.S. Open Cup]] in a single season, completing a domestic [[double (association football)|double]]. D.C. in turn became the first team to reach three consecutive finals and the first club to fail to score; D.C. also posted the best record in MLS that year with 24 wins (the L.A. Galaxy also won that same number of games), which is also a record that stands today.\n\nAs the top two finishers in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], both D.C. United and Chicago Fire earned the right to represent the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in the [[1999 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]]. The clubs faced off once again in the third-place match of the continental tournament, almost a year after meeting in MLS Cup 1998. That match ended in a 2\u20132 draw.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:2008-1226-Pasadena-008-RoseBowl.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] hosted the [[MLS Cup]] final for the first time.]]\n\nThe [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]], was announced as the host venue for MLS Cup 1998 on October 25, 1997.

The Rose Bowl had also hosted major soccer events, including the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] gold medal match, the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final]], and was set to host the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final]].\n\nLocal side Los Angeles Galaxy barely missed the opportunity to play for MLS Cup at home after falling to Chicago in the Western Conference Final.\n\n==Road to the final==\n\nMLS Cup 1998 was the third consecutive edition to feature [[D.C. United]], managed by [[Bruce Arena]] to a first place finish in the Eastern Conference. They faced the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], an expansion team led by former United assistant manager [[Bob Bradley]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Yannis |first=Alex |date=October 25, 1998 |title=Friendly Coaching Rivals Meet for the M.L.S.
