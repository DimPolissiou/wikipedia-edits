Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of [[cumbia music|cumbia]] and [[regional styles of Mexican music]]. The album was released following company president [[Jose Behar]]'s failed [[crossover (music)|crossover]] request for the singer. The project was denied by the heads of [[EMI Records]]' pop division, believing the singer should first strengthen her fanbase. Selena's brother and principal [[record producer]] and songwriter, [[A.B. Quintanilla|A.B. Quintanilla III]] fought to remain the singer's producer. The [[Selena y Los Dinos|band]] introduced [[Pete Astudillo]] and Joe Ojeda, who contributed to the album's [[experimental music|experimental]] production and songwriting. Aside from A.B., Selena worked with two Mexican songwriters, Alejandro Montealegre and Reinaldo Ornelas.\n\nBecause ''Selena'' was the singer's first work on a major label, the album was expected to draw and lure large audiences to Selena. The goal of the album was to be introductory into the international [[Latin music]] market, with future sights into an English-language crossover. ''Selena'' peaked at number seven on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Regional Mexican Albums]], Selena's first entry in a national [[music chart]]. ''Selena'' performed better than other recordings from other contemporaneous female Tejano singers. The recording led Selena to win [[Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of The Year|Female Vocalist of the Year]] and [[Tejano Music Award for Entertainer of the Year|Female Entertainer of the Year]] at the [[1990 Tejano Music Awards]]. Songs from the album, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" was nominated for [[Tejano Music Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], while \"Amame, Quiereme\" was nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year.\n\n''Selena'' increased the singer's popularity, she became a [[sex icon]] after the album's release. Critics called the recording a moderate success that eventually \"opened the doors\" for the group. Beginning with ''Selena'', the singer and her band began experimenting with various genres that led to the introduction of cumbia music. The genre was heavily used in subsequent releases, which became her trademark. The album spawned three singles, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", \"Mentiras\", and a Spanish-language version of a Japanese song called \"[[Sukiyaki (song)#Selena version|Sukiyaki]]\".\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter starting [[Selena y Los Dinos|a band with his children]], [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]] became the group's manager and began promoting it.{{sfn|Verhovek|1995}} The group recorded an album with Freddie Records in 1984, though it was never released.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Abraham provided two [[demo (music)|demos]] to Charlie Grever, father of [[Bob Grever]] owner of Cara Records, who signed then-thirteen old [[Selena]] to the recording label.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} [[Manny Guerra]], who separated from Cara Records, started his own record label.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Guerra wanted to sign Selena to his recording label in 1985. Guerra dissolved the agreement between Cara Records and Selena when it was brought to his attention.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Selena recorded five LP records for Manny's GP Productions by 1988, without a contract.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Abraham expressed in an interview how he forgot to sign it, and noticed how Guerra stopped asking him about the contract after Selena became more popular.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} At the [[1989 Tejano Music Awards]], Selena was approached by [[Rick Trevino]] to be the opening act after [[La Sombra]] declined the offer.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} [[Jose Behar]] of newly formed [[EMI Latin]] and the heads of [[Sony Music Latin|Sony Music]] attended the awards ceremony and were scouting for new acts.{{sfn|Burr|1995}}{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} Behar wanted to sign Selena to his label, while Sony Music was offering twice EMI's offer.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} Behar believed he had discovered \"the next [[Gloria Estefan]]\",{{sfn|Mitchell|1995}} which his superior called him illogical since he had only been in Texas for a week.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} Abraham chose EMI Latin's offer because of the potential for a [[crossover (music)|crossover]], and he wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign with the company.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}}{{sfn|Gersham|1997}}{{sfn|Clark|2005}} Before Selena began recording her debut album, Behar and [[Stephen Finfer]] requested a crossover album for her.{{sfn|Lopetegui|1995}} The singer recorded three English-language songs for the heads of EMI's pop division. Behar and Finfer's request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album.{{sfn|Minnick|2010}} Behar thought EMI Records and the public did not believe that a [[Mexican-American]] woman could have \"crossover potential\" after [[Charles Koppelman]] denied the project.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} The company believed Selena had potential in Mexico and South American markets when they signed the singer in 1989.{{sfn|Joseph|2018|p=328}}\n\nInitially, EMI Latin wanted a [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer to work with Selena on her album.{{sfn|Ramirez|2015}} Her brother and [[bass guitar]]ist, [[A.B. Quintanilla]] became the singer's principal record producer and songwriter prior to signing with EMI Latin in 1989.{{sfn|Ramirez|2015}} EMI Latin felt that they were \"gambling\" when they opened a Latin division.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Abraham went into an agreement that if A.B. failed to produce a successful album, then they would approve of a Grammy Award producer for her next recording.{{sfn|Ramirez|2015}} Under pressure, A.B. expressed how the band \"couldn't take a failure\" and worried that if they did, the band would be \"[[wikt:low on the totem pole|at the bottom of the totem pole]]\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} The production of the album began on June 4, 1989, Selena expressed her excitement about the album; in an interview, she said: \"I am really happy, all the hard work paid off.\"{{sfn|Caicedo|1989|p=138}} The goal of ''Selena'' was to be an introductory into the international [[Latin music]] market, with future sights into an English-language crossover.{{sfn|Caicedo|1989|p=138}} The band became \"a bit more trendier and a little bit cutting-edge\" on ''Selena'' with [[experimental music|experimental]] production and songwriting.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} It was the first album with any production and songwriting assistance from [[Pete Astudillo]] and Joe Ojeda; Astudillo was brought in to [[harmony|harmonize]] and sing duets with Selena, while Ojeda acted as a second keyboardist.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=82}} Ojeda bought a [[Roland D-50]] [[synthesizer]]; at the time of one of the most popular keyboards, which contributed to the overall \"flashy\" sounds in the album.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Keyboardist, [[Ricky Vela]] said in an interview how he and Astudillo began elaborating the [[music arrangement|arrangements]] in their [[music production]].{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}\n\n== Recording and composition ==\n{{Listen|filename=Sukiyaki.ogg|title=\"Sukiyaki\" (1989)|description=\"Sukiyaki\" was a 1960s Japanese pop song translated into Spanish from an English-language version written by Janice Marie Johnson.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}|format=[[Ogg]]}} \n''Selena'' was recorded in its entirety, with the exception of \"[[Sukiyaki (song)|Sukiyaki]]\" and \"My Love\", at Manny Guerra's [[AMEN Studios]] in San Antonio, Texas and was engineered by house engineer Brian \"Red\" Moore. \"Sukiyaki\" and \"My Love\" were recorded at Sunrise Studios in Houston, Texas.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Selena wanted the album to concentrate on [[Tejano music]] and [[Latin pop]].{{sfn|Caicedo|1989|p=138}} A.B. found the genres in ''Selena'' to be [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]].{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} ''Selena'' incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of cumbia and [[regional styles of Mexican music]].{{sfn|Pe\u00f1a|2002|p=204}} [[Bolero]]s and [[polka music]] were other genres explored on ''Selena''.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=81}} Astudillo had written a concept and gave it to A.B. after the band's concert in [[Laredo, Texas]].{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} The resulting song was called \"Besitos\", it was the first recording A.B. and Astudillo collaborated, and the first song Astudillo wrote for the group. A.B. found \"Besitos\" as the \"pivotal point [in Selena's career]\" because of the introduction of [[cumbia music]], a genre the band used heavily in subsequent releases.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} \"Besitos\" became a platform for the group in producing more cumbia-flavored tracks in Selena's second studio release, ''[[Ven Conmigo (album)|Ven Conmigo]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}\n\nAbraham suggested the idea of writing \"Sukiyaki\"\u2014a 1960s Japanese song by [[Kyu Sakamoto]]\u2014into a Spanish-language song.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} He expressed his interest after an [[Sukiyaki#A Taste of Honey version|English-language version]] by [[A Taste of Honey]] was released.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Abraham worked with Astudillo to write the recording. The lyrics used were a Spanish version of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Vela confirmed that he was supposed to help with the writing process of \"Sukiyaki\" but did not contribute.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Vela expressed how Astudillo's songwriting skills and Spanish were more advanced and overall preferred Astudillo in writing \"Sukiyaki\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Joe Nick Patoski wrote in ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that \"Sukiyaki\" is a \"sentimental\" track.{{sfn|Patoski|2010}}\n\nAstudillo was due to record [[backing vocals]] on \"Amame, Quiereme\", his first recording sessions in a studio, Suzette noticed how nervous he was at recording.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} He was removed from the recording studio after an unsuccessful session, he expressed his disappointment at not meeting the desired [[vocal range|range]] in an interview. After his friend successfully recorded the track, Astudillo retried and met the required demands.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Astudillo said how his aspirations of recording in a studio inspired him to not give up.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Selena wrote \"My Love\", an English-language track that A.B. believed echoed works by [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]] and [[Sweet Sensation (trio)|Sweet Sensation]]. He helped with the arrangements along with Astudillo. It was Selena's first attempt at songwriting.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Biographer Joe Nick Patoski, believed \"My Love\" was paean to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=81}} Vela was chosen to record the [[accordion]] on \"Mentiras\", though he expressed how his instrument was not up to par and had faulty sounds that sounded \"un-accordion\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} The group decided to hire professional studio accordions after Vela's \"cringy\" sounding instrument was brought to the band's attention.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} A.B. desperately needed more materials to record for ''Selena'', Vela wrote some parts for a song called \"Tengo Ganas de Lloar\". In retrospect, Vela said how his part was not satisfactory even though A.B. liked it, for which Vela said he was \"just being polite, so he let it pass because we needed another song\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Though A.B. remained the singer's principle record producer and songwriter, he did not compose \"Sukiyaki\" (Abraham/Astudillo), \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" (Alejandro Montealegre), and \"No Te Vayas\" (Reinaldo Ornelas).{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{sfn|Erlewine|n.d.

Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of [[cumbia music|cumbia]] and [[regional styles of Mexican music]]. The album was released following company president [[Jose Behar]]'s failed [[crossover (music)|crossover]] request for the singer. The project was denied by the heads of [[EMI Records]]' pop division, believing the singer should first strengthen her fanbase. Selena's brother and principal [[record producer]] and songwriter, [[A.B. Quintanilla|A.B. Quintanilla III]] fought to remain the singer's producer. The [[Selena y Los Dinos|band]] introduced [[Pete Astudillo]] and Joe Ojeda, who contributed to the album's [[experimental music|experimental]] production and songwriting. Aside from A.B., Selena worked with two Mexican songwriters, Alejandro Montealegre and Reinaldo Ornelas.\n\nBecause ''Selena'' was the singer's first work on a major label, the album was expected to draw and lure large audiences to Selena. The goal of the album was to be introductory into the international [[Latin music]] market, with future sights into an English-language crossover. ''Selena'' peaked at number seven on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Regional Mexican Albums]], Selena's first entry in a national [[music chart]]. ''Selena'' performed better than other recordings from other contemporaneous female Tejano singers. The recording led Selena to win [[Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of The Year|Female Vocalist of the Year]] and [[Tejano Music Award for Entertainer of the Year|Female Entertainer of the Year]] at the [[1990 Tejano Music Awards]]. Songs from the album, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" was nominated for [[Tejano Music Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], while \"Amame, Quiereme\" was nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year.\n\n''Selena'' increased the singer's popularity, she became a [[sex icon]] after the album's release. Critics called the recording a moderate success that eventually \"opened the doors\" for the group. Beginning with ''Selena'', the singer and her band began experimenting with various genres that led to the introduction of cumbia music. The genre was heavily used in subsequent releases, which became her trademark. The album spawned three singles, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", \"Mentiras\", and a Spanish-language version of a Japanese song called \"[[Sukiyaki (song)#Selena version|Sukiyaki]]\".\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter starting [[Selena y Los Dinos|a band with his children]], [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]] became the group's manager and began promoting it.{{sfn|Verhovek|1995}} The group recorded an album with Freddie Records in 1984, though it was never released.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Abraham provided two [[demo (music)|demos]] to Charlie Grever, father of [[Bob Grever]] owner of Cara Records, who signed then-thirteen old [[Selena]] to the recording label.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} [[Manny Guerra]], who separated from Cara Records, started his own record label.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Guerra wanted to sign Selena to his recording label in 1985. Guerra dissolved the agreement between Cara Records and Selena when it was brought to his attention.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Selena recorded five LP records for Manny's GP Productions by 1988, without a contract.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} Abraham expressed in an interview how he forgot to sign it, and noticed how Guerra stopped asking him about the contract after Selena became more popular.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} At the [[1989 Tejano Music Awards]], Selena was approached by [[Rick Trevino]] to be the opening act after [[La Sombra]] declined the offer.{{sfn|Rivas|2014}} [[Jose Behar]] of newly formed [[EMI Latin]] and the heads of [[Sony Music Latin|Sony Music]] attended the awards ceremony and were scouting for new acts.{{sfn|Burr|1995}}{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} Behar wanted to sign Selena to his label, while Sony Music was offering twice EMI's offer.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} Behar believed he had discovered \"the next [[Gloria Estefan]]\",{{sfn|Mitchell|1995}} which his superior called him illogical since he had only been in Texas for a week.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} Abraham chose EMI Latin's offer because of the potential for a [[crossover (music)|crossover]], and he wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign with the company.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}}{{sfn|Gersham|1997}}{{sfn|Clark|2005}} Before Selena began recording her debut album, Behar and [[Stephen Finfer]] requested a crossover album for her.{{sfn|Lopetegui|1995}} The singer recorded three English-language songs for the heads of EMI's pop division. Behar and Finfer's request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album.{{sfn|Minnick|2010}} Behar thought EMI Records and the public did not believe that a [[Mexican-American]] woman could have \"crossover potential\" after [[Charles Koppelman]] denied the project.{{sfn|Anon.|2008}} The company believed Selena had potential in Mexico and South American markets when they signed the singer in 1989.{{sfn|Joseph|2018|p=328}}\n\nInitially, EMI Latin wanted a [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer to work with Selena on her album.{{sfn|Ramirez|2015}} Her brother and [[bass guitar]]ist, [[A.B. Quintanilla]] became the singer's principal record producer and songwriter prior to signing with EMI Latin in 1989.{{sfn|Ramirez|2015}} EMI Latin felt that they were \"gambling\" when they opened a Latin division.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Abraham went into an agreement that if A.B. failed to produce a successful album, then they would approve of a Grammy Award producer for her next recording.{{sfn|Ramirez|2015}} Under pressure, A.B. expressed how the band \"couldn't take a failure\" and worried that if they did, the band would be \"[[wikt:low on the totem pole|at the bottom of the totem pole]]\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} The production of the album began on June 4, 1989, Selena expressed her excitement about the album; in an interview, she said: \"I am really happy, all the hard work paid off.\"{{sfn|Caicedo|1989|p=138}} The goal of ''Selena'' was to be an introductory into the international [[Latin music]] market, with future sights into an English-language crossover.{{sfn|Caicedo|1989|p=138}} The band became \"a bit more trendier and a little bit cutting-edge\" on ''Selena'' with [[experimental music|experimental]] production and songwriting.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} It was the first album with any production and songwriting assistance from [[Pete Astudillo]] and Joe Ojeda; Astudillo was brought in to [[harmony|harmonize]] and sing duets with Selena, while Ojeda acted as a second keyboardist.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=82}} Ojeda bought a [[Roland D-50]] [[synthesizer]]; at the time of one of the most popular keyboards, which contributed to the overall \"flashy\" sounds in the album.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Keyboardist, [[Ricky Vela]] said in an interview how he and Astudillo began elaborating the [[music arrangement|arrangements]] in their [[music production]].{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}\n\n== Recording and composition ==\n{{Listen|filename=Sukiyaki.ogg|title=\"Sukiyaki\" (1989)|description=\"Sukiyaki\" was a 1960s Japanese pop song translated into Spanish from an English-language version written by Janice Marie Johnson.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}|format=[[Ogg]]}} \n''Selena'' was recorded in its entirety, with the exception of \"[[Sukiyaki (song)|Sukiyaki]]\" and \"My Love\", at Manny Guerra's [[AMEN Studios]] in San Antonio, Texas and was engineered by house engineer Brian \"Red\" Moore. \"Sukiyaki\" and \"My Love\" were recorded at Sunrise Studios in Houston, Texas.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Selena wanted the album to concentrate on [[Tejano music]] and [[Latin pop]].{{sfn|Caicedo|1989|p=138}} A.B. found the genres in ''Selena'' to be [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]].{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} ''Selena'' incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of cumbia and [[regional styles of Mexican music]].{{sfn|Pe\u00f1a|2002|p=204}} [[Bolero]]s and [[polka music]] were other genres explored on ''Selena''.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=81}} Astudillo had written a concept and gave it to A.B. after the band's concert in [[Laredo, Texas]].{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} The resulting song was called \"Besitos\", it was the first recording A.B. and Astudillo collaborated, and the first song Astudillo wrote for the group. A.B. found \"Besitos\" as the \"pivotal point [in Selena's career]\" because of the introduction of [[cumbia music]], a genre the band used heavily in subsequent releases.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} \"Besitos\" became a platform for the group in producing more cumbia-flavored tracks in Selena's second studio release, ''[[Ven Conmigo (album)|Ven Conmigo]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}\n\nAbraham suggested the idea of writing \"Sukiyaki\"\u2014a 1960s Japanese song by [[Kyu Sakamoto]]\u2014into a Spanish-language song.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} He expressed his interest after an [[Sukiyaki#A Taste of Honey version|English-language version]] by [[A Taste of Honey]] was released.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Abraham worked with Astudillo to write the recording. The lyrics used were a Spanish version of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Vela confirmed that he was supposed to help with the writing process of \"Sukiyaki\" but did not contribute.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Vela expressed how Astudillo's songwriting skills and Spanish were more advanced and overall preferred Astudillo in writing \"Sukiyaki\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Joe Nick Patoski wrote in ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that \"Sukiyaki\" is a \"sentimental\" track.{{sfn|Patoski|2010}}\n\nAstudillo was due to record [[backing vocals]] on \"Amame, Quiereme\", his first recording sessions in a studio, Suzette noticed how nervous he was at recording.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} He was removed from the recording studio after an unsuccessful session, he expressed his disappointment at not meeting the desired [[vocal range|range]] in an interview. After his friend successfully recorded the track, Astudillo retried and met the required demands.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Astudillo said how his aspirations of recording in a studio inspired him to not give up.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Selena wrote \"My Love\", an English-language track that A.B. believed echoed works by [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]] and [[Sweet Sensation (trio)|Sweet Sensation]]. He helped with the arrangements along with Astudillo. It was Selena's first attempt at songwriting.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Biographer Joe Nick Patoski, believed \"My Love\" was paean to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=81}} Vela was chosen to record the [[accordion]] on \"Mentiras\", though he expressed how his instrument was not up to par and had faulty sounds that sounded \"un-accordion\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} The group decided to hire professional studio accordions after Vela's \"cringy\" sounding instrument was brought to the band's attention.{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} A.B. desperately needed more materials to record for ''Selena'', Vela wrote some parts for a song called \"Tengo Ganas de Lloar\". In retrospect, Vela said how his part was not satisfactory even though A.B. liked it, for which Vela said he was \"just being polite, so he let it pass because we needed another song\".{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}} Though A.B. remained the singer's principle record producer and songwriter, he did not compose \"Sukiyaki\" (Abraham/Astudillo), \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" (Alejandro Montealegre), and \"No Te Vayas\" (Reinaldo Ornelas).{{sfn|Quintanilla|1989}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{sfn|Erlewine|n.d.

The foundation has over 300 centers across the country, in big cities, small towns and remote rural areas, providing medical aid, family planning and emergency assistance. They own air ambulances, providing quick access to far-flung areas.\n\nIn Karachi alone, the Edhi Foundation runs 8 hospitals providing free medical care, eye hospitals, diabetic centres, surgical units, a 4- bed cancer hospital and mobile dispensaries. In addition to these the Foundation also manages two blood banks in Karachi. As with other Edhi services, employed professionals and volunteers run these. The foundation has a Legal aid department, which provides free services and has secured the release of countless innocent prisoners.

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"

(season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansAoS\" /> By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole.<ref name=\"Inhumans2\" /> In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and scheduled for release July 2019.<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used.<ref name=\"ColeNo\" /> In April 2016, ''Inhumans'' was removed from the release schedule,<ref name=\"InhumansNoReleaseDate\" /> and would no longer be a part of Phase Three.<ref name=\"InhumansNoPhase3\" /> In July 2016, Feige said ''Inhumans'' would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four.<ref name=\"FeigeInhumansNov2016\" /> In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', which premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in September 2017, after [[Inhumans premiere|the first two episodes]] were screened in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries\" /> The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film.<ref name=\"InhumansTVSeries2\" /> ABC canceled ''Inhumans'' after one season in May 2018.<ref name=\"InhumansCanceled\" />\n*{{anchor|Runaways}} '''''Runaways''''': A film based on the ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' went through a number of iterations. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> The following October, development on the film was put on hold,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved in favor of ''The Avengers'', with the earliest it could release being Phase Three.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with ''Runaways'' some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" /> In August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] announced ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' from the streaming service [[Hulu]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHuluOrder\" /> with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> It premiered in November 2017.<ref name=\"RunawaysPremiere\"

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was canceled in June 1969, at the height of the [[Apollo program]], after it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11-12}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}} \n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}\n\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase. Dyna-Soar would be launched into orbit by a [[Titan III]] booster.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|p=353}}{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=311}}\n\nThe same 22 February memorandum tacit approval for the development of a space station. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program - Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million in funding for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120-122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply arriving every 120 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=25-27}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=370-371}} On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation the MOL program.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after coming to office, the [[Kennedy administration]] tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37-38}} No administration official could even admit they existed until President [[Jimmy Carter]] did so in 1978.{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=378-379}} MOL therefore became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the Discoverer/Corona spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Planning==\nOn 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=36}} About $6 million was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37-38}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43-44}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} In all, some $3,237,716 was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500, followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43-44}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[General Electric]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40-41}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1,653 million. The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, an human operated system was superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, this could be greatly reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71-79}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Rusk to Robert McNamar |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost. The [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William Raborn]] thought that it might. McNamara took the proposal to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] on 24 August 1965, who approved it, and issued an official announcement at a press conference the following day.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71-79}}<ref>{{cite press release |title=President Johnson's Statement on MOL |date=25 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/129.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1965, Schriever had appointed [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Harry L.

Under this agreement, the Deputy Director MOL would forward black cost estimates to the NRO Controller, who had the authority to obligate NRO funds. This was followed by a corresponding MOL White Financial Procedures Agreement, which was approved by Flax in December and signed by [[Leonard Marks Jr.]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller)]]. This provided for a more regular channel, with funds going through the AFSC to its Space Systems Division (SSD) and thence to the MOL SPO.  Thus far no definition contracts had been let, except for the Titan III booster. On 30 September, Brown released $12 million in fiscal year 1965 funds and $50 million in fiscal year 1966 funds for the MOL definition phase activities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=85-88}}\n\nThe President had announced two contractors: Douglas and General Electric. While the former had considerable technical and managerial experience from the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[AIR-2 Genie|Genie]] and [[Project Nike|Nike]] projects, General Electric had experience with large optical systems, and, perhaps more importantly, had over 1,000 personnel immediately cleared for Dorian, while Douglas had very few. A $10.55 million [[Fixed-price contract]] was signed with Douglas on 17 October. Contract negotiations with General Electric were also completed around this time, and it was given $4.922 mullion, all but $0.975 million of it in black funds.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=85-88}} [[The Aerospace Corporation]] was given responsibility for general systems engineering/technical direction (GSE/TD).{{sfn|Strom|2004|p=12}} Douglas selected four major subcontractors: [[Hamilton-Standard]] for environmental control and life support; [[Collins Radio]] for the communications; [[Honeywell]] for the attitude control; and [[Pratt & Whitney]] for the electrical power; and [[IBM]] for data management.

The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from Califonia, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch sattelites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather sattalites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians.

To allay Soviet fears that the MOL would carry nuclear weapons, the State Department suggested that Soviet officials be permitted to inspect it for them before launch, but Brown opposed this on security grounds.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=73}}\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]].

In November 1965, Flax arbitraily cut $20 million from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million in 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne Day |date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2858/1 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology\">{{cite web |title= MOL Program Chronology |date=December 1967 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/97.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Contracts were signed in May 1967.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from August to December 1971.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=150-151}}   \n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]], replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version. Although it did not fly until July 1966, the authors were aware of the capabilities of the [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite. While it could not achieve the same resolution as the Dorian camera on MOL,<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Measure of a Man: Evaluating the Role of Astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=19 March 2018 |publisher=The Space Review |access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref> it had a resolution of 13\u201315 inches, and could remain on orbit longer, and carry more film than earlier spy satellites.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], he knew that MOL would be canceled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}}\n\nThe report pointed out that crewed systems had many advantages over automated ones, which lost up to half their images to cloud cover on a typical mission. A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|mi|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\" />\n\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74-75}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148-149}}\n\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that \"receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities.\"{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=157}} Stewart briefed the new [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[David Packard]], on the MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970. This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156-157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million, but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million. The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget's recommendation to cancel the MOL and proceed with Hexagon instead.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=158-162}}     \nOn 7 June, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM, and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was canceled in June 1969, at the height of the [[Apollo program]], after it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11-12}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}} \n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}\n\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase. Dyna-Soar would be launched into orbit by a [[Titan III]] booster.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|p=353}}{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=311}}\n\nThe same 22 February memorandum tacit approval for the development of a space station. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program - Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million in funding for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120-122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply arriving every 120 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=25-27}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=370-371}} On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation the MOL program.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after coming to office, the [[Kennedy administration]] tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37-38}} No administration official could even admit they existed until President [[Jimmy Carter]] did so in 1978.{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=378-379}} MOL therefore became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the Discoverer/Corona spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Planning==\nOn 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=36}} About $6 million was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37-38}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43-44}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} In all, some $3,237,716 was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500, followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43-44}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[General Electric]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40-41}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1,653 million. The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, an human operated system was superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, this could be greatly reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71-79}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Rusk to Robert McNamar |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost.

The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from Califonia, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch sattelites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather sattalites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] on 24 February, chaired by the influential Senator [[Clinton P.

Three Almaz space stations flew as [[Salyut]] space stations, and the program also developed a military add-on used on [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |title=The Almaz program |publisher=Russian Space Web |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000112/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |title=Almaz |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Mark |last=Wade |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119184429/http://astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |archive-date=19 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Almprog/almprog.htm |title=The Almaz Space Station Program |publisher=Sven's Space Place |first=Sven |last=Grahn |access-date=12 February 2011}}</ref>\n==Delays and cost increases==\nWithin weeks of the President's announcement of the MOL Program, it was facing budget cuts. In November 1965, Flax arbitraily cut $20 million from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million in 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne Day |date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2858/1 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology\">{{cite web |title= MOL Program Chronology |date=December 1967 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/97.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Contracts were signed in May 1967.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from from August to December 1971.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=150-151}}   \n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]], replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version. Although it did not fly until July 1966, the authors were aware of the capabilities of the [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite. While it could not achieve the same resolution as the Dorian camera on MOL,<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Measure of a Man: Evaluating the Role of Astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=19 March 2018 |publisher=The Space Review |access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref> it had a resolution of 13\u201315 inches, and could remain on orbit longer, and carry more film than earlier spy satellites.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], he knew that MOL would be canceled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4-5}}\n\nThe report pointed out that crewed systems had many advantages over automated ones, which lost up to half their images to cloud cover on a typical mission. A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|mi|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\" />\n\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74-75}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148-149}}\n\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that \"receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities.\"{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=157}} Stewart briefed the new [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[David Packard]], on the MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970. This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156-157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million, but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million. The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget's recommendation to cancel the MOL and proceed with Hexagon instead.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=158-162}}     \nOn 7 June, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM, and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts. The official announcement that the MOL was canceled was made on 10 June.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=162-163}}{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAt the time of the MOL was cancelled, fourteen of the seventeen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} Finlay returned to the US Navy in April 1968,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=230}} and Adams left in July 1966 to join the X-15 Program.
