During the climax of the story, it is revealed that she opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]], and is attacking Muggle-born students while being possessed by [[Lord Voldemort|Tom Riddle's]] old school diary. [[Lucius Malfoy]] had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in [[Places in Harry Potter#Flourish & Blotts|Flourish and Blotts]] prior to the term. She has little involvement in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', though she is studying at Hogwarts throughout the book. In ''[[Goblet of Fire]]'', her role was larger as she attends the ''Quidditch World Cup'' and the ''Yule Ball'' with [[Neville Longbottom]] and can be seen in background appearances.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', Ginny had \"given up on Harry months ago\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]|author=[[J.K.

During the last part of the book, Ginny breaks up with Michael due to his sulking over Ravenclaw's defeat in the Quidditch Cup final, later replacing him with Dean Thomas. She joins [[Dumbledore's Army]] and is one of five members who accompany Harry in his attempt to rescue [[Sirius Black]] from the [[Department of Mysteries]].

During the climax of the story, it is revealed that she opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]], and is attacking Muggle-born students while being possessed by [[Lord Voldemort|Tom Riddle's]] old school diary. [[Lucius Malfoy]] had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in [[Places in Harry Potter#Flourish & Blotts|Flourish and Blotts]] prior to the term. She has little involvement in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', though she is studying at Hogwarts throughout the book.

When [[Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] punishes Harry with a \"lifetime\" [[Quidditch]] ban, Ginny replaces him as Gryffindor [[Quidditch|Seeker]].  During the last part of the book, Ginny breaks up with Michael due to his sulking over Ravenclaw's defeat in the Quidditch Cup final, later replacing him with Dean Thomas. She joins [[Dumbledore's Army]] and is one of five members who accompany Harry in his attempt to rescue [[Sirius Black]] from the [[Department of Mysteries]].

She returns to Hogwarts for her sixth year, where she works with Neville and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] on reuniting Dumbledore's Army.
