For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's \"the Book of the Machines\" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365\u2013383</ref> \n{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}\nIn 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states that he does not \"understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015|date=29 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right?

Probably not{{endash}}but this is more or less what is happening with AI.'<ref name=\"hawking editorial\"/>}}\n\nMany of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult \"control problem\" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence?<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><ref name=\"physica_scripta\" /><!-- in physica_scripta, see sections 3.3.2.

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the technological singularity. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that \"I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time.

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation.

Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage.

For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI.

Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists.

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt\u2019s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |pages = 106\u2013111|type = Print |volume=71}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===\n{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}\n\nWhile current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \"self-aware\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

The child was not registered in the Civil Registry until he was four years of age and, upon the abandonment of the mother, her partner took care of the child and registered him as Abel David Lebrijo Gonz\u00e1lez, his surname despite him not being his biological father. These being the first surname that appear in the legal document. From then on, in different records and documents such as schooling, they change the second last name to Raposo, from his new partner. At the age of six the adoption procedures began and at age seven he became known as Abel David Azcona Ema, taking on the surname of his adoptive mother. The adoptive family refused to use Abel's name since his adoption because it implied a connection to the biological mother, who chose the name. At fifteen years of age, Azcona was adopted by the new husband of his adoptive mother, so he becomes Abel David Marcos Azcona and, after a family process approved to invert the surnames, Azcona returns to the first name and he's definitely Abel David Azcona Marcos. At the age of twenty he decided to remove the name \u201cDavid\u201d, having no relationship with his adoptive family and using Abel again, as a tribute to his biological mother and as a response to the prohibition and imposition of the other name.

In this new work, he explored a change towards the figure of his mother, taking [[hormones]] and engaging in prostitution. The process continued in the cities of Madrid and Mexico City. Thie performance emerged, as with the rest of his sex-themed works, as an exercise in empathy with his own [[biological mother]]. It was also a social critique, where the artist explored the limits of his body by repeating patterns of sexual abuse, which occurred in his own childhood and in the life of his mother. In 2016, Azcona activated his last piece in this series, ''La Guerra'' (''The War''), which premiered at the ''Intramurs Festival'' in [[Valencia]], Spain, which was again inspired by prostitution, criticism and sexuality.

Azcona made a metaphorical critique by merging both walls in the work.

The work has been criticized and denounced by the State of Israel.<ref name=\"El Diario.es\"/>\n\n====''Amen or The Pederasty''====\nAlthough named ''Amen'' by Azcona himself, the work is more commonly known as ''The Pederasty'' (\u201c''La pederastia''\u201d in Spanish). Over a period of several months, Azcona attended [[Eucharist]]s in churches and parishes that were linked to his own childhood. (Azcona had received a [[Catholic]] education from the age of seven following his adoption.) In the churches, the artist keeps the wafer or consecrated host given to the attendees of the [[Holy Communion|communion]]. He gathered two hundred and forty-two wafers, which was the number of cases of pederasty reported in the north of Spain during the previous decade. With the wafers, he made a work in which the word ''Pederasty'' could be read.

In ''The Shadow,'' he denounced cases of child abuse in a piece in which the survivors are the [[protagonists]].

Azcona inaugurated a series of works of a performative nature with the critical content of religious entities. In the works, Azcona used representative icons of various religions, such as the Koran, the [[Bible]], the [[Torah]] and other objects of a sacred character. In the most [[controversial]] of them, Azcona performs for nine-hour during which he ingests the pages of a copy of the Koran. This work provoked the most repercussions of any of the series, and the artist was threatened and persecuted for the piece.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda |first1=Oscar |title=Abel Azcona threatened for his work Eating a Koran |url=https://www.plataformadeartecontemporaneo.com/pac/abel-azcona-amenazado-por-su-trabajo-eating-a-koran/ |accessdate=January 15, 2020 |work=Contemporary Art Platform |date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> The work was performed again in the [[Krudtt\u00f8nden]], [[Copenhagen]]. From there, Azcona founded an art collection together with other artists such as [[Lars Vilks]] and [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]], who had been persecuted and threatened for their creations. With the collective, including Vilks, N\u00f8rgaard, the writer [[Salman Rushdie]] and the cartoonist [[Charb]] (who was killed in the attack on [[Charlie Hebdo]]), Azcona carried out performances and conferences for [[freedom of speech]] in the Krudtt\u00f8nden between 2013 and 2015. In 2015 the Krudtt\u00f8nden building was [[2015 Copenhagen shootings|attacked by terrorists]] during a conference.

The durational piece included dozens of female survivors of prostitution who gave a physical description of their last [[Client (prostitution)|client]]. On the other side of a ten-meter-long table, [[facial composite|composite artists]] listened to them and drew images of the clients. The performance generated dozens of portraits which, at the closing of the work in 2017, were exhibited with the premise that any of them could be Azcona's father. The biographical work creates a critical discourse with prostitution and its inheritance, and in the case of Azcona himself, of an unknown father, having been conceived during an act of prostitution.\n{{quote|text=Abel Azcona, the son of a prostituted woman who is looking for his whoremonger father, because it perfectly summarizes everything that the patriarchy has built on their subordination and for our autonomy.

Azcona's biological mother decided on Abel's name and when registering him at the Montesa Clinic as her own, he was first called Abel Luj\u00e1n Guti\u00e9rrez, her last name. The child was not registered in the Civil Registry until he was four years of age and, upon the abandonment of the mother, her partner took care of the child and registered him as Abel David Lebrijo Gonz\u00e1lez, his surname despite him not being his biological father. These being the first surname that appear in the legal document. From then on, in different records and documents such as schooling, they change the second last name to Raposo, from his new partner. At the age of six the adoption procedures began and at age seven he became known as Abel David Azcona Ema, taking on the surname of his adoptive mother. The adoptive family refused to use Abel's name since his adoption because it implied a connection to the biological mother, who chose the name. At fifteen years of age, Azcona was adopted by the new husband of his adoptive mother, so he becomes Abel David Marcos Azcona and, after a family process approved to invert the surnames, Azcona returns to the first name and he's definitely Abel David Azcona Marcos. At the age of twenty he decided to remove the name \u201cDavid\u201d, having no relationship with his adoptive family and using Abel again, as a tribute to his biological mother and as a response to the prohibition and imposition of the other name.

On this occasion, Azcona offered his naked body, [[anesthetized]] by the use of [[narcotics]], so that the visitor could use it freely.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sahuquillo |first1=Paula |title=We went to see how people abused Abel Azcona's drugged body |url=https://www.vice.com/es/article/exw58j/abel-azcona-la-guerra-performance |accessdate=January 12, 2020 |work=Vice |date=November 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Abel Azcona.

His previous works had caused Azcona to receive threats, persecution, and acts of violence.

Azcona made a metaphorical critique by merging both walls in the work. The actual installation, as if it were a piece of [[land art]], currently remains along the wall, and has been exhibited in different countries through photographic and video art. The work has been criticized and denounced by the State of Israel.<ref name=\"El Diario.es\"/>\n\n====''Amen or The Pederasty''====\nAlthough named ''Amen'' by Azcona himself, the work is more commonly known as ''The Pederasty'' (\u201c''La pederastia''\u201d in Spanish). Over a period of several months, Azcona attended [[Eucharist]]s in churches and parishes that were linked to his own childhood. (Azcona had received a [[Catholic]] education from the age of seven following his adoption.) In the churches, the artist keeps the wafer or consecrated host given to the attendees of the [[Holy Communion|communion]]. He gathered two hundred and forty-two wafers, which was the number of cases of pederasty reported in the north of Spain during the previous decade. With the wafers, he made a work in which the word ''Pederasty'' could be read. The work was first exhibited at a central Madrid art gallery in the summer of 2015.<ref name= Taleg\u00f3n>{{cite news |last1=Taleg\u00f3n |first1=Beatriz |title=Abel Azcona: \"Call me\" son of a bitch \"I think it's beautiful |url=https://diario16.com/abel-azcona-que-me-llamen-hijo-de-puta-me-parece-bello-el-insulto-seria-ser-hijo-de-putero/ |accessdate=January 14, 2020 |work=Diario 16 |date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2015, a section of the work was selected to be part of a [[retrospective exhibition]] of the artists works inside the city of Pamplona's Monument to the Fallen in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The work was located on the [[altar]] of the old monument, which was formerly the cathedral of Pamplona, but at the time of Azconas' show, it was [[desacralization|desacralized]]. Along with Amen's other critical works about child abuse such as ''The Shadow'' was displayed. In ''The Shadow,'' he denounced cases of child abuse in a piece in which the survivors are the [[protagonists]]. In the work, Azcona presented more than two hundred actual cases of pedophilia in museums and galleries in various cities in Spain. At each show, Azcona gave a live performance from a wooden swing of the experiences of the survivors. A swing was also installed inside the Monument to the Fallen of Pamplona.<ref name= Taleg\u00f3n/>\n\nThe day after the [[inauguration]] of the exhibition, multiple demonstrations and demands for its closure occurred.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Naiz |title=Opening of the exhibition of Abel Azcona |url=https://www.naiz.eus/es/blogs/berriola/posts/apertura-de-la-exposicion-de-abel-azcona |accessdate=February 2, 2020 |work=Naiz |date=November 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fern\u00e1ndez |first1=Eva |title=The exhibition by Azcona continues with the controversial part but without the sacred forms |url=https://www.diariodenavarra.es/noticias/navarra/pamplona_comarca/pamplona/2015/11/24/abierta_muestra_abel_azcona_con_parte_polemica_sin_retirar_339862_1702.html |accessdate=January 2, 2020 |work=Diario de Navarra |issue=November 25, 2015}}</ref> The Catholic Church called it the greatest offense to [[Christian belief]] on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Iglesia |first1=Navarra |title=Desecrating Jesus Eucharist is a very grave sacrilege |url=http://www.iglesianavarra.org/noticias/2015/11/profanar-a-jesus-eucaristia-es-un-sacrilegio-gravisimo/ |publisher=Iglesia Navarra |accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Anarte |first1=Enrique |title=Abel Azcona pisses off the Christian ultras by writing \"pederasty\" with consecrated hosts |url=https://www.vice.com/es/article/9b7kgz/abel-azcona-hostias-performance-666 |accessdate=February 2, 2020 |work=Vice |date=November 24, 2015}}</ref> Azcona documented all these situations of confrontation and included them in the exhibitions of the work.

Azcona inaugurated a series of works of a performative nature with the critical content of religious entities. In the works, Azcona used representative icons of various religions, such as the Koran, the [[Bible]], the [[Torah]] and other objects of a sacred character. In the most [[controversial]] of them, Azcona performs for nine-hour during which he ingests the pages of a copy of the Koran. This work provoked the most repercussions of any of the series, and the artist was threatened and persecuted for the piece.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda |first1=Oscar |title=Abel Azcona threatened for his work Eating a Koran |url=https://www.plataformadeartecontemporaneo.com/pac/abel-azcona-amenazado-por-su-trabajo-eating-a-koran/ |accessdate=January 15, 2020 |work=Contemporary Art Platform |date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> The work was performed again in the [[Krudtt\u00f8nden]], [[Copenhagen]]. From there, Azcona founded an art collection together with other artists such as [[Lars Vilks]] and [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]], who had been persecuted and threatened for their creations. With the collective, including Vilks, N\u00f8rgaard, the writer [[Salman Rushdie]] and the cartoonist [[Charb]] (who was killed in the attack on [[Charlie Hebdo]]), Azcona carried out performances and conferences for [[freedom of speech]] in the Krudtt\u00f8nden between 2013 and 2015. In 2015 the Krudtt\u00f8nden building was [[2015 Copenhagen shootings|attacked by terrorists]] during a conference. Subsequently, the work ''Eating a Koran'', was bought by a Danish collector and donated to the Krudtt\u00f8nden for the permanent exhibition.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Snaphanen |title=Abel Azcona: Eating a Quran in Copenhagen |url=https://snaphanen.dk/2013/06/04/abel-azcona-eating-a-quran-in-copenhagen/ |publisher=Snaphanen}}</ref>\n\n====''The Fathers''====\n''The Fathers'' was first performed in 2016 in Madrid with the final performance, also in Madrid, in 2017 in an exhibition format. The durational piece included dozens of female survivors of prostitution who gave a physical description of their last [[Client (prostitution)|client]]. On the other side of a ten-meter-long table, [[facial composite|composite artists]] listened to them and drew images of the clients. The performance generated dozens of portraits which, at the closing of the work in 2017, were exhibited with the premise that any of them could be Azcona's father. The biographical work creates a critical discourse with prostitution and its inheritance, and in the case of Azcona himself, of an unknown father, having been conceived during an act of prostitution.\n{{quote|text=Abel Azcona, the son of a prostituted woman who is looking for his whoremonger father, because it perfectly summarizes everything that the patriarchy has built on their subordination and for our autonomy.

[[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]] were concurrently to the west. The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses, because only a few words, mainly titles and personal names, were preserved in the Chinese sources.

This new political unity transformed them into a more formidable state by enabling formation of larger armies and the ability to exercise better strategic coordination. The Xiongnu adopted many of the Chinese agriculture techniques such as slaves for heavy labor, wore silk like the Chinese, and lived in Chinese-style homes.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H., ''Old World Encounters,'' 1993, pg. 38</ref> The reason for creating the confederation remains unclear.

He crushed the power of the [[Donghu people]] of eastern Mongolia and Manchuria as well as the [[Yuezhi]] in the [[Hexi Corridor]] of [[Gansu]], where his son, Jizhu, made a [[skull cup]] out of the [[Yuezhi]] king. Modu also reoccupied all the lands previously taken by the Qin general Meng Tian.\n\nUnder Modu's leadership, the Xiongnu threatened the Han dynasty, almost causing [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]], the first Han emperor, to lose his throne in 200 BC.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\" /> By the time of Modu's death in 174 BC, the Xiongnu had driven the Yuezhi from the Hexi Corridor, killing the Yuezhi king in the process and asserting their presence in the [[Western Regions]].<ref name=Rene />\n\nThe Xiongnu were recognized as the most prominent of the nomads bordering the Chinese Han empire<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\">Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 36</ref> and during early relations between the Xiongnu and the Han, the former held the balance of power.

Along with arranged marriages, the Han sent gifts to bribe the Xiongnu to stop attacking.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H., ''Old World Encounters'', 1993, pg. 36</ref> After the defeat at Pingcheng in 200 BC, the Han emperor abandoned a military solution to the Xiongnu threat. Instead, in 198 BC{{nbsp}}, the courtier {{Interlanguage link multi|Liu Jing (Han dynasty)|zh|3=\u5289\u656c (\u897f\u6f22)|lt=Liu Jing}} was dispatched for negotiations. The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a Han princess given in marriage to the ''chanyu'' (called ''[[heqin]]'') ({{zh|c=\u548c\u89aa|l=harmonious kinship}}); periodic gifts to the Xiongnu of [[silk]], [[distilled beverage]]s and [[rice]]; equal status between the states; and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] as mutual border.\n\nThis first treaty set the pattern for relations between the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and the Xiongnu for sixty years. Up to 135&nbsp;BC, the treaty was renewed nine times, each time with an increase in the \"gifts\" to the Xiongnu Empire. In 192&nbsp;BC, [[Modu Chanyu|Modun]] even asked for the hand of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] widow [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. His son and successor, the energetic Jiyu, known as the [[Laoshang Chanyu]], continued his father's expansionist policies. Laoshang succeeded in negotiating with [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] terms for the maintenance of a large scale government sponsored market system.\n\nWhile the Xiongnu benefited handsomely, from the Chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly, very humiliating, and ineffective. [[Laoshang Chanyu]] showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously. On one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near [[Chang'an]]. In 166 BC he personally led 140,000 cavalry to invade [[Anding District, Tainan|Anding]], reaching as far as the imperial retreat at Yong. In 158 BC, his successor sent 30,000 cavalry to attack [[Shangdang]] and another 30,000 to [[Yunzhong Commandery|Yunzhong]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Xiongnu also [[Heqin#Xiongnu|practiced marriage alliances with Han dynasty officers and officials]] who defected to their side. The older sister of the Chanyu (the Xiongnu ruler) was married to the Xiongnu General [[Zhao Xin]], the Marquis of Xi who was serving the Han dynasty. The daughter of the Chanyu was married to the [[Han Chinese]] General [[Li Ling]] after he surrendered and defected.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/5147439/Aristocratic_elites_in_the_Xiongnu_empire], p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"SimaWatson1993\">{{cite book|author1=Qian Sima|author2=Burton Watson|title=Records of the Grand Historian: Han dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YNlgKEVYdHEC&pg=PA161&dq=li+guangli+daughter#v=onepage&q=li%20guangli%20daughter&f=false|date=January 1993|publisher=Renditions-Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08166-5|pages=161\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Monumenta Serica|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-1wAAAAMAAJ&q=li+guangli+daughter+chanyu&dq=li+guangli+daughter+chanyu|year=2004|publisher=H.

By that point the empire was consolidated politically, militarily and economically, and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court. In that year, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty.\n\nFull-scale war broke out in autumn 129 BC, when 40,000 Chinese [[cavalry]] made a surprise attack on the Xiongnu at the border markets. In 127 BC, the Han general [[Wei Qing]] retook the Ordos. In 121 BC, the Xiongnu suffered another setback when [[Huo Qubing]] led a force of light cavalry westward out of Longxi and within six days fought his way through five Xiongnu kingdoms. The Xiongnu Hunye king was forced to surrender with 40,000 men. In 119 BC both Huo and Wei, each leading 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 footsoldiers (in order to keep up with the mobility of the Xiongnu, many of the non-cavalry Han soldiers were mobile infantrymen who traveled on horseback but fought on foot), and advancing along different routes, forced the chanyu and his Xiongnu court to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].{{Sfn | Loewe | 1974}}{{Page needed |date=December 2014}} Major logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns. According to the analysis of Yan You (\u56b4\u5c24), the difficulties were twofold. Firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances.  Secondly, the weather in the northern Xiongnu lands was difficult for Han soldiers, who could never carry enough fuel.{{NoteTag|This view was put forward to [[Wang Mang]] in AD 14{{Refn|''Han Shu'' (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju ed) 94B, p. 3824.}}.}} According to official reports, the Xiongnu lost 80,000 to 90,000 men, and out of the 140,000 horses the Han forces had brought into the desert, fewer than 30,000 returned to China.\n\nIn 104 and 102 BC, the Han fought and won the [[War of the Heavenly Horses]] against the Kingdom of [[Dayuan]]. As a result, the Han gained many [[Ferghana horse]]s which further aided them in their battle against the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] and Gansu corridor to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people]]s to the south, and also gained direct access to the [[Western Regions]]. Because of strong Chinese control over the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu became unstable and were no longer a threat to the Han Chinese.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H, \"Old World Encounters\", 1993, p. 37</ref>\n\n[[File:Asia 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Xiongnu among other people in Asia around 1 AD.]]\n[[Ban Chao]], Protector General (\u90fd\u8b77; ''Duhu'') of the Han dynasty, embarked with an army of 70,000 soldiers in a campaign against the Xiongnu remnants who were harassing the trade route now known as the [[Silk Road]].  His successful military campaign saw the subjugation of one Xiongnu tribe after another. Ban Chao also sent an envoy named [[Gan Ying]] to [[Daqin]] (Rome).  Ban Chao was created the Marquess of Dingyuan (\u5b9a\u9060\u4faf, i.e., \"the Marquess who stabilized faraway places\") for his services to the Han Empire and returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] at the age of 70 years and died there in the year 102.  Following his death, the power of the Xiongnu in the Western Regions increased again, and the emperors of subsequent dynasties did not reach as far west until the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 42\u201347] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 }}</ref>\n\n=== Xiongnu Civil War (60\u201353 BC) ===\nWhen a Chanyu died, power could pass to his younger brother if his son was not of age. This system, which can be compared to Gaelic [[tanistry]], normally kept an adult male on the throne, but could cause trouble in later generations when there were several lineages that might claim the throne.  When the 12th Chanyu died in 60 BC, power was taken by Woyanqudi, a grandson of the 12th Chanyu's cousin. Being something of a usurper, he tried to put his own men in power, which only increased the number of his enemies. The 12th Chanyu's son fled east and, in 58 BC, revolted. Few would support Woyanqudi and he was driven to suicide, leaving the rebel son, [[Huhanye]], as the 14th Chanyu. The Woyanqudi faction then set up his brother, Tuqi, as Chanyu (58 BC). In 57 BC three more men declared themselves Chanyu. Two dropped their claims in favor of the third who was defeated by Tuqi in that year and surrendered to Huhanye the following year. In 56 BC Tuqi was defeated by Huhanye and committed suicide, but two more claimants appeared: Runzhen and Huhanye's elder brother [[Zhizhi Chanyu]]. Runzhen was killed by Zhizhi in 54 BC, leaving only Zhizhi and Huhanye. Zhizhi grew in power, and, in 53 BC, Huhanye moved south and submitted to the Chinese. Huhanye used Chinese support to weaken Zhizhi, who gradually moved west. In 49 BC, a brother to Tuqi set himself up as Chanyu and was killed by Zhizhi. In 36 BC, Zhizhi was killed by a Chinese army while trying to establish a new kingdom in the far west near [[Lake Balkhash]].\n\n=== Tributary relations with the Han ===\n[[File:Bronze seal of a Xiongnu chief.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bronze seal says \"To '''Han''' obedient, friendly and loyal chief of Xiongnu of '''Han''' ('''\u6f22'''\u5308\u5974\u6b78\u7fa9\u89aa'''\u6f22'''\u9577)\"\uff0eBronze seal conferred by the Eastern Han government on a Xiongnu chief.]]\nIn 53 BC [[Huhanye]] (\u547c\u97d3\u90aa) decided to enter into tributary relations with [[Han China]].<ref name=Rene1>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 37\u201338] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 }}</ref> The original terms insisted on by the Han court were that, first, the ''Chanyu'' or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage; secondly, the ''Chanyu'' should send a hostage prince; and thirdly, the ''Chanyu'' should present tribute to the Han emperor. The political status of the Xiongnu in the Chinese world order was reduced from that of a \"brotherly state\" to that of an \"outer vassal\" (\u5916\u81e3). During this period, however, the Xiongnu maintained political sovereignty and full territorial integrity. The [[Great Wall of China]] continued to serve as the line of demarcation between Han and Xiongnu.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHuhanye sent his son, the \"wise king of the right\" Shuloujutang, to the Han court as hostage. In 51 BC he personally visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor on the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. In the same year, another envoy Qijushan (\u7a3d\u5c45\u72e6) was received at the [[Sweet Spring Palace]] in the north west of modern [[Shanxi]].{{sfn|Fairbank & T\u00eang|1941}} On the financial side, Huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold, cash, clothes, silk, horses and grain for his participation. Huhanye made two further homage trips, in 49 BC and 33 BC; with each one the imperial gifts were increased. On the last trip, Huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. As a sign of the decline in the political status of the Xiongnu, [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] refused, giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting. One of them was [[Wang Zhaojun]], famed in Chinese folklore as one of the [[Four Beauties]].\n\nWhen Zhizhi learned of his brother's submission, he also sent a son to the Han court as hostage in 53&nbsp;BC. Then twice, in 51 BC and 50 BC, he sent envoys to the Han court with tribute. But having failed to pay homage personally, he was never admitted to the tributary system. In 36 BC, a junior officer named [[Chen Tang]], with the help of Gan Yanshou, protector-general of the Western Regions, assembled an expeditionary force that defeated him at the [[Battle of Zhizhi]] and sent his head as a trophy to Chang'an.\n\nTributary relations were discontinued during the reign of Huduershi (18 AD\u201348), corresponding to the political upheavals of the [[Xin Dynasty]] in China. The Xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions, as well as neighboring peoples such as the [[Wuhuan]]. In 24 AD, Hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system.\n\n=== Southern Xiongnu and Northern Xiongnu ===\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = horizontal|header=|header_align = left/right/center|footer = An [[Eastern Han]] Chinese glazed ceramic statue of a horse with [[bridle]] and [[halter]] headgear, from [[Sichuan]], late 2nd century to early 3rd century AD|footer_align = left|image1 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 02.JPG|width1 = 130|caption1 =|image2 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 03.JPG|width2 = 263|caption2 =}}\nThe Xiongnu's new power was met with a policy of appeasement by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]. At the height of his power, Huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor, Modu. Due to growing regionalism among the Xiongnu, however, Huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority. In contravention of a principle of [[fraternal succession]] established by Huhanye, Huduershi designated his son Punu as [[heir-apparent]]. However, as the eldest son of the preceding ''chanyu'', Bi (Pi) \u2013 the Rizhu King of the Right \u2013 had a more legitimate claim. Consequently, Bi refused to attend the annual meeting at the ''chanyu'''s court. Nevertheless, in 46 AD, Punu ascended the throne.\n\nIn 48 AD, a confederation of eight Xiongnu tribes in Bi's power base in the south, with a military force totalling 40,000 to 50,000 men, seceded from Punu's kingdom and acclaimed Bi as ''chanyu''. This kingdom became known as the '''Southern Xiongnu'''.\n\n==== The Northern Xiongnu ====\n\n{{Main|Northern Chanyu (1st century)}}\n\nThe rump kingdom under Punu, around the [[Orkhon Valley|Orkhon]] (modern north central Mongolia) became known as the '''Northern Xiongnu'''. Punu, who became known as the Northern ''Chanyu'', began to put military pressure on the Southern Xiongnu.\n\nIn 49 AD, Tsi Yung, a Han governor of [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]], allied with the [[Wuhuan]] and [[Xianbei]], attacked the Northern Xiongnu.<ref name=Rene0>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/39 39] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/39 }}</ref>\nThe Northern Xiongnu suffered two major defeats: one at the hands of the Xianbei in 85 AD, and by the Han during the [[Battle of Ikh Bayan]], in 89 AD.

Consequently, in 50 AD, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to tributary relations with Han China. The system of tribute was considerably tightened by the Han, to keep the Southern Xiongnu under control. The ''chanyu'' was ordered to establish his court in the Meiji district of [[Xihe Commandery]] and the Southern Xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies. At the same time, large numbers of Chinese were also resettled in these commanderies, in mixed Han-Xiongnu settlements. Economically, the Southern Xiongnu became reliant on trade with the Han.\n\nTensions were evident between Han settlers and practitioners of the nomadic way of life. Thus, in 94, Anguo Chanyu joined forces with newly subjugated Xiongnu from the north and started a large scale rebellion against the Han.\n\nDuring the late 2nd century AD, the southern Xiongnu were drawn into the rebellions then plaguing the Han court. In 188, the ''chanyu'' was murdered by some of his own subjects for agreeing to send troops to help the Han suppress a rebellion in [[Hebei]] \u2013 many of the Xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the Han court. The murdered ''chanyu's'' son [[Yufuluo]], entitled Chizhisizhu ({{lang|zh|\u6301\u81f3\u5c38\u9010\u4faf}}), succeeded him, but was then overthrown by the same rebellious faction in 189. He travelled to [[Luoyang]] (the Han capital) to seek aid from the Han court, but at this time the Han court was in disorder from the clash between Grand General [[He Jin]] and the eunuchs, and the intervention of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]]. The ''chanyu'' had no choice but to settle down with his followers in [[Linfen|Pingyang]], a city in [[Shanxi]]. In 195, he died and was succeeded as ''chanyu'' by his brother [[Huchuquan Chanyu]].\n\nIn 215\u2013216 AD, the warlord-statesman [[Cao Cao]] detained [[Huchuquan Chanyu]] in the city of [[Ye, China|Ye]], and divided his followers in Shanxi into five divisions: left, right, south, north, and centre. This was aimed at preventing the exiled Xiongnu in Shanxi from engaging in rebellion, and also allowed Cao Cao to use the Xiongnu as auxiliaries in his cavalry.\n\nLater the Xiongnu aristocracy in Shanxi changed their surname from [[Luanti]] to Liu for prestige reasons, claiming that they were related to the Han imperial clan through the old intermarriage policy. After Huchuquan, the Southern Xiongnu were partitioned into five local tribes.  Each local chief was under the \"surveillance of a chinese resident\", while the shanyu was in \"semicaptivity at the imperial court.\"<ref name=Rene111>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 54] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 }}</ref>\n\n=== Later Xiongnu states in northern China ===\nThe Southern Xiongnu that settled in northern China during the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] retained their tribal affiliation and political organization and played an active role in Chinese politics.  During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (304\u2013439 CE), Southern Xiongnu leaders founded or ruled several kingdoms, including [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]]'s [[Han Zhao]] Kingdom (also known as [[Former Zhao]]), [[Helian Bobo]]'s [[Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xia]] and [[Juqu Mengxun]]'s [[Northern Liang]]\n==== Former Zhao state (304\u2013329) ====\n\n{{Main|Former Zhao}}\n\n;Han Zhao dynasty (304\u2013318)\nIn 304, [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]] became Chanyu of the Five Hordes.

The purpose of raiding China was not simply for goods, but to force the Chinese to pay regular tribute. The power of the Xiongnu ruler was based on his control of Chinese tribute which he used to reward his supporters. The Han and Xiongnu empires rose at the same time because the Xiongnu state depended on Chinese tribute.  A major Xiongnu weakness was the custom of lateral succession. If a dead ruler's son was not old enough to take command, power passed to the late ruler's brother. This worked in the first generation but could lead to civil war in the second generation. The first time this happened, in 60 BC, the weaker party adopted what Barfield calls the 'inner frontier strategy.'  They moved south and submitted to China and then used Chinese resources to defeat the Northern Xiongnu and re-establish the empire.  The second time this happened, about 47 AD, the strategy failed. The southern ruler was unable to defeat the northern ruler and the Xiongnu remained divided.<ref>{{Citation|last=Barfield|first=Thomas J|title=The Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China, 221 BC to AD 1757|year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== Ethnolinguistic origins{{anchor|Language}} ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Pronunciation of \u5308<br /> <small>Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929174528/http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=%5Cdata%5Cchina%5Cbigchina&first=1&text_character=%E5%8C%88 http://starling.rinet.ru]</small>\n|-\n|Preclassic [[Old Chinese]]: || {{IPA|s\u014bo\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Classic Old Chinese: || {{IPA-ltc|\u014b\u030ao\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Postclassic Old Chinese: || {{IPA|ho\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Middle Chinese]]: || {{IPA|x\u00f6u\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Standard Mandarin|Modern Mandarin]]: || {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1}}\n|}\n[[File:East-Hem 300ad.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Xiongnu and other steppe nations in 300 AD.]]\n\nThe Chinese name for the Xiongnu was a [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative term in itself]], as the characters (\u5308\u5974) have the meaning of \"fierce slave\".<ref name=yuuu86-384 /> (The Chinese characters are pronounced as ''Xi\u014dngn\u00fa'' {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1|n|u|2}} in modern [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]].)\n\nThere are several theories on the ethnolinguistic identity of the Xiongnu.\n\n=== Huns ===\n{{see also|Origin of the Huns}}\nThe sound of the first Chinese character (\u5308) in the name has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/q\u02b0o\u014b/}} in Old Chinese.<ref>Baxter-Sagart (2014).</ref> This sound has a possible similarity with the name \"[[Huns|Hun]]\" in European languages.

It could lend credence to the theory that the Huns were in fact descendants of the Northern Xiongnu who migrated westward, or that the Huns were using a name borrowed from the Northern Xiongnu, or that these Xiongnu made up part of the Hun confederation.\n\nThe Xiongnu-Hun hypothesis originated with the 18th-century French historian [[Joseph de Guignes]], who noticed that ancient Chinese scholars had referred to members of tribes associated with the Xiongnu by names similar to \"Hun\", albeit with varying Chinese characters.

Three mirrors were acquired from three different graves at the site. The mirror found at feature 160 is believed to be a low-quality, local imitation of a Han mirror, while the whole mirror found at feature 100 and fragments of a mirror found at feature 109 are believed to belong to the classical TLV mirrors and date back to the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]] or the early to middle [[Eastern han|Eastern Han period]].<ref name=\"Lai 34\u201343\">{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Guolong|title=The Date of the TLV Mirrors from the Xiongnu Tombs|journal=The Silk Road|volume=4|issue=1|pages=34\u201343|url=http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol4num1/srnewsletter_v4n1.pdf}}</ref> The archaeologists have chosen to, for the most part, refrain from positing anything about Han-Xiongnu relations based on these particular mirrors.

An example of animal predation associated with Xiongnu culture is a tiger carrying dead prey.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> We see a similar image in work from Maoqinggou, a site which is presumed to have been under Xiongnu political control but is still clearly non-Xiongnu. From Maoqinggou, we see the prey replaced by an extension of the tiger's foot. The work also depicts a lower level of execution; Maoqinggou work was executed in a rounder, less detailed style.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> In its broadest sense, Xiongnu iconography of animal predation include examples such as the gold headdress from Aluchaideng and gold earrings with a turquoise and jade inlay discovered in Xigouban, Inner Mongolia.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The gold headdress can be viewed, along with some other examples of Xiongnu art, from the external links at the bottom of this article.\n\nXiongnu art is harder to distinguish from [[Saka]] or [[Scythian art]]. There was a similarity present in stylistic execution, but Xiongnu art and Saka art did often differ in terms of iconography. Saka art does not appear to have included predation scenes, especially with dead prey, or same-animal combat. Additionally, Saka art included elements not common to Xiongnu iconography, such as a winged, horned horse.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The two cultures also used two different bird heads. Xiongnu depictions of birds have a tendency to have a moderate eye and beak and have ears, while Saka birds have a pronounced eye and beak and no ears.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}} Some scholars{{who|date=November 2014}} claim these differences are indicative of cultural differences. Scholar Sophia-Karin Psarras claims that Xiongnu images of animal predation, specifically tiger plus prey, is spiritual, representative of death and rebirth, and same-animal combat is representative of the acquisition of or maintenance of power.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}}\n\n=== Rock art and writing ===\nThe rock art of the [[Yin Mountains|Yin]] and [[Helan Mountains]] is dated from the 9th millennium BC to the 19th century AD.

From this a some scholars hold that the Xiongnu had a script similar to Eurasian runiform and this alphabet itself served as the basis for the ancient Turkic writing.<ref>Ishjamts 1996: 166</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (vol. [[:zh:s:\u53f2\u8a18/\u5377110|110]]) state that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood; they also mention a \"Hu script\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Fig6Ishjamts p166R1.gif|2nd century BCE \u2013 2nd century CE characters of Hun-[[Xianbei]] script (Mongolia and Inner Mongolia), N.

From their lifestyle of herding flocks and their horse-trade with China, it can be concluded that their diet consist mainly of [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], [[horse meat]] and wild geese that were shot down.\n\n== Possible connection to Korean Silla Dynasty ==\nIn various kinds of ancient inscriptions on monuments of [[Munmu of Silla]], it is recorded that King Munmu possibly came from an unknown Xiongnu-tribe or that he has partially Xiongnu ancestry. According to several historians, it is possible that this unknown tribe was originally of [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] origin and joined the Xiongnu confederation. Later the tribes ruling family returned to Korea and married into the royal family of Silla.

The Xiongnu were also active in areas now part of [[Siberia]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]]. Their relations with adjacent Chinese dynasties to the south east were complex, with repeated periods of conflict and intrigue, alternating with exchanges of [[tribute]], trade, and marriage treaties ([[heqin]]).\n\nDuring the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] era, they were also known as one of the [[Five Barbarians]] who took part in an uprising against Chinese rule known as the [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]].\n\nAttempts to identify the Xiongnu with later groups of the western [[Eurasian Steppe]] remain controversial. [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]] were concurrently to the west. The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses, because only a few words, mainly titles and personal names, were preserved in the Chinese sources.

This new political unity transformed them into a more formidable state by enabling formation of larger armies and the ability to exercise better strategic coordination. The Xiongnu adopted many of the Chinese agriculture techniques such as slaves for heavy labor, wore silk like the Chinese, and lived in Chinese-style homes.<ref>Bently, Jerry H., ''Old World Encounters,'' 1993, pg. 38</ref> The reason for creating the confederation remains unclear. Suggestions include the need for a stronger state to deal with the [[Qin's wars of unification|Qin unification of China]]<ref>Barfield 1989</ref> that resulted in a loss of the Ordos region at the hands of [[Meng Tian]] or the political crisis that overtook the Xiongnu in 215 BC when [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] armies evicted them from their pastures on the [[Yellow River]].<ref>di Cosmo 1999: 885\u2013966</ref>\n\nAfter forging internal unity, [[Modu Chanyu]] expanded the empire on all sides. To the north he conquered a number of nomadic peoples, including the [[Dingling]] of southern Siberia. He crushed the power of the [[Donghu people]] of eastern Mongolia and Manchuria as well as the [[Yuezhi]] in the [[Hexi Corridor]] of [[Gansu]], where his son, Jizhu, made a [[skull cup]] out of the [[Yuezhi]] king. Modu also reoccupied all the lands previously taken by the Qin general Meng Tian.\n\nUnder Modu's leadership, the Xiongnu threatened the Han dynasty, almost causing [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]], the first Han emperor, to lose his throne in 200 BC.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\" /> By the time of Modu's death in 174 BC, the Xiongnu had driven the Yuezhi from the Hexi Corridor, killing the Yuezhi king in the process and asserting their presence in the [[Western Regions]].<ref name=Rene />\n\nThe Xiongnu were recognized as the most prominent of the nomads bordering the Chinese Han empire<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\">Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 36</ref> and during early relations between the Xiongnu and the Han, the former held the balance of power.

The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a Han princess given in marriage to the ''chanyu'' (called ''[[heqin]]'') ({{zh|c=\u548c\u89aa|l=harmonious kinship}}); periodic gifts to the Xiongnu of [[silk]], [[distilled beverage]]s and [[rice]]; equal status between the states; and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] as mutual border.\n\nThis first treaty set the pattern for relations between the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and the Xiongnu for sixty years. Up to 135&nbsp;BC, the treaty was renewed nine times, each time with an increase in the \"gifts\" to the Xiongnu Empire. In 192&nbsp;BC, [[Modu Chanyu|Modun]] even asked for the hand of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] widow [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. His son and successor, the energetic Jiyu, known as the [[Laoshang Chanyu]], continued his father's expansionist policies. Laoshang succeeded in negotiating with [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] terms for the maintenance of a large scale government sponsored market system.\n\nWhile the Xiongnu benefited handsomely, from the Chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly, very humiliating, and ineffective. [[Laoshang Chanyu]] showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously. On one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near [[Chang'an]]. In 166 BC he personally led 140,000 cavalry to invade [[Anding District, Tainan|Anding]], reaching as far as the imperial retreat at Yong. In 158 BC, his successor sent 30,000 cavalry to attack [[Shangdang]] and another 30,000 to [[Yunzhong Commandery|Yunzhong]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Xiongnu also [[Heqin#Xiongnu|practiced marriage alliances with Han dynasty officers and officials]] who defected to their side. The older sister of the Chanyu (the Xiongnu ruler) was married to the Xiongnu General [[Zhao Xin]], the Marquis of Xi who was serving the Han dynasty. The daughter of the Chanyu was married to the [[Han Chinese]] General [[Li Ling]] after he surrendered and defected.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/5147439/Aristocratic_elites_in_the_Xiongnu_empire], p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"SimaWatson1993\">{{cite book|author1=Qian Sima|author2=Burton Watson|title=Records of the Grand Historian: Han dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YNlgKEVYdHEC&pg=PA161&dq=li+guangli+daughter#v=onepage&q=li%20guangli%20daughter&f=false|date=January 1993|publisher=Renditions-Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08166-5|pages=161\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Monumenta Serica|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-1wAAAAMAAJ&q=li+guangli+daughter+chanyu&dq=li+guangli+daughter+chanyu|year=2004|publisher=H.

By that point the empire was consolidated politically, militarily and economically, and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court. In that year, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty.\n\nFull-scale war broke out in autumn 129 BC, when 40,000 Chinese [[cavalry]] made a surprise attack on the Xiongnu at the border markets. In 127 BC, the Han general [[Wei Qing]] retook the Ordos. In 121 BC, the Xiongnu suffered another setback when [[Huo Qubing]] led a force of light cavalry westward out of Longxi and within six days fought his way through five Xiongnu kingdoms. The Xiongnu Hunye king was forced to surrender with 40,000 men. In 119 BC both Huo and Wei, each leading 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 footsoldiers (in order to keep up with the mobility of the Xiongnu, many of the non-cavalry Han soldiers were mobile infantrymen who traveled on horseback but fought on foot), and advancing along different routes, forced the chanyu and his Xiongnu court to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].{{Sfn | Loewe | 1974}}{{Page needed |date=December 2014}} Major logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns. According to the analysis of Yan You (\u56b4\u5c24), the difficulties were twofold. Firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances.  Secondly, the weather in the northern Xiongnu lands was difficult for Han soldiers, who could never carry enough fuel.{{NoteTag|This view was put forward to [[Wang Mang]] in AD 14{{Refn|''Han Shu'' (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju ed) 94B, p. 3824.}}.}} According to official reports, the Xiongnu lost 80,000 to 90,000 men, and out of the 140,000 horses the Han forces had brought into the desert, fewer than 30,000 returned to China.\n\nIn 104 and 102 BC, the Han fought and won the [[War of the Heavenly Horses]] against the Kingdom of [[Dayuan]]. As a result, the Han gained many [[Ferghana horse]]s which further aided them in their battle against the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] and Gansu corridor to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people]]s to the south, and also gained direct access to the [[Western Regions]]. Because of strong Chinese control over the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu became unstable and were no longer a threat to the Han Chinese.<ref>Bently, Jerry H, \"Old World Encounters\", 1993, p. 37</ref>\n\n[[File:Asia 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Xiongnu among other people in Asia around 1 AD.]]\n[[Ban Chao]], Protector General (\u90fd\u8b77; ''Duhu'') of the Han dynasty, embarked with an army of 70,000 soldiers in a campaign against the Xiongnu remnants who were harassing the trade route now known as the [[Silk Road]].  His successful military campaign saw the subjugation of one Xiongnu tribe after another. Ban Chao also sent an envoy named [[Gan Ying]] to [[Daqin]] (Rome).  Ban Chao was created the Marquess of Dingyuan (\u5b9a\u9060\u4faf, i.e., \"the Marquess who stabilized faraway places\") for his services to the Han Empire and returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] at the age of 70 years and died there in the year 102.  Following his death, the power of the Xiongnu in the Western Regions increased again, and the emperors of subsequent dynasties did not reach as far west until the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 42\u201347] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 }}</ref>\n\n=== Xiongnu Civil War (60\u201353 BC) ===\nWhen a Chanyu died, power could pass to his younger brother if his son was not of age. This system, which can be compared to Gaelic [[tanistry]], normally kept an adult male on the throne, but could cause trouble in later generations when there were several lineages that might claim the throne.  When the 12th Chanyu died in 60 BC, power was taken by Woyanqudi, a grandson of the 12th Chanyu's cousin. Being something of a usurper, he tried to put his own men in power, which only increased the number of his enemies. The 12th Chanyu's son fled east and, in 58 BC, revolted. Few would support Woyanqudi and he was driven to suicide, leaving the rebel son, [[Huhanye]], as the 14th Chanyu. The Woyanqudi faction then set up his brother, Tuqi, as Chanyu (58 BC). In 57 BC three more men declared themselves Chanyu. Two dropped their claims in favor of the third who was defeated by Tuqi in that year and surrendered to Huhanye the following year. In 56 BC Tuqi was defeated by Huhanye and committed suicide, but two more claimants appeared: Runzhen and Huhanye's elder brother [[Zhizhi Chanyu]]. Runzhen was killed by Zhizhi in 54 BC, leaving only Zhizhi and Huhanye. Zhizhi grew in power, and, in 53 BC, Huhanye moved south and submitted to the Chinese. Huhanye used Chinese support to weaken Zhizhi, who gradually moved west. In 49 BC, a brother to Tuqi set himself up as Chanyu and was killed by Zhizhi. In 36 BC, Zhizhi was killed by a Chinese army while trying to establish a new kingdom in the far west near [[Lake Balkhash]].\n\n=== Tributary relations with the Han ===\n[[File:Bronze seal of a Xiongnu chief.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bronze seal says \"To '''Han''' obedient, friendly and loyal chief of Xiongnu of '''Han''' ('''\u6f22'''\u5308\u5974\u6b78\u7fa9\u89aa'''\u6f22'''\u9577)\"\uff0eBronze seal conferred by the Eastern Han government on a Xiongnu chief.]]\nIn 53 BC [[Huhanye]] (\u547c\u97d3\u90aa) decided to enter into tributary relations with [[Han China]].<ref name=Rene1>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 37\u201338] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 }}</ref> The original terms insisted on by the Han court were that, first, the ''Chanyu'' or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage; secondly, the ''Chanyu'' should send a hostage prince; and thirdly, the ''Chanyu'' should present tribute to the Han emperor. The political status of the Xiongnu in the Chinese world order was reduced from that of a \"brotherly state\" to that of an \"outer vassal\" (\u5916\u81e3). During this period, however, the Xiongnu maintained political sovereignty and full territorial integrity. The [[Great Wall of China]] continued to serve as the line of demarcation between Han and Xiongnu.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHuhanye sent his son, the \"wise king of the right\" Shuloujutang, to the Han court as hostage. In 51 BC he personally visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor on the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. In the same year, another envoy Qijushan (\u7a3d\u5c45\u72e6) was received at the [[Sweet Spring Palace]] in the north west of modern [[Shanxi]].{{sfn|Fairbank & T\u00eang|1941}} On the financial side, Huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold, cash, clothes, silk, horses and grain for his participation. Huhanye made two further homage trips, in 49 BC and 33 BC; with each one the imperial gifts were increased. On the last trip, Huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. As a sign of the decline in the political status of the Xiongnu, [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] refused, giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting. One of them was [[Wang Zhaojun]], famed in Chinese folklore as one of the [[Four Beauties]].\n\nWhen Zhizhi learned of his brother's submission, he also sent a son to the Han court as hostage in 53&nbsp;BC. Then twice, in 51 BC and 50 BC, he sent envoys to the Han court with tribute. But having failed to pay homage personally, he was never admitted to the tributary system. In 36 BC, a junior officer named [[Chen Tang]], with the help of Gan Yanshou, protector-general of the Western Regions, assembled an expeditionary force that defeated him at the [[Battle of Zhizhi]] and sent his head as a trophy to Chang'an.\n\nTributary relations were discontinued during the reign of Huduershi (18 AD\u201348), corresponding to the political upheavals of the [[Xin Dynasty]] in China. The Xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions, as well as neighboring peoples such as the [[Wuhuan]]. In 24 AD, Hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system.\n\n=== Southern Xiongnu and Northern Xiongnu ===\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = horizontal|header=|header_align = left/right/center|footer = An [[Eastern Han]] Chinese glazed ceramic statue of a horse with [[bridle]] and [[halter]] headgear, from [[Sichuan]], late 2nd century to early 3rd century AD|footer_align = left|image1 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 02.JPG|width1 = 130|caption1 =|image2 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 03.JPG|width2 = 263|caption2 =}}\nThe Xiongnu's new power was met with a policy of appeasement by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]. At the height of his power, Huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor, Modu. Due to growing regionalism among the Xiongnu, however, Huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority. In contravention of a principle of [[fraternal succession]] established by Huhanye, Huduershi designated his son Punu as [[heir-apparent]]. However, as the eldest son of the preceding ''chanyu'', Bi (Pi) \u2013 the Rizhu King of the Right \u2013 had a more legitimate claim. Consequently, Bi refused to attend the annual meeting at the ''chanyu'''s court. Nevertheless, in 46 AD, Punu ascended the throne.\n\nIn 48 AD, a confederation of eight Xiongnu tribes in Bi's power base in the south, with a military force totalling 40,000 to 50,000 men, seceded from Punu's kingdom and acclaimed Bi as ''chanyu''. This kingdom became known as the '''Southern Xiongnu'''.\n\n==== The Northern Xiongnu ====\n\n{{Main|Northern Chanyu (1st century)}}\n\nThe rump kingdom under Punu, around the [[Orkhon Valley|Orkhon]] (modern north central Mongolia) became known as the '''Northern Xiongnu'''. Punu, who became known as the Northern ''Chanyu'', began to put military pressure on the Southern Xiongnu.\n\nIn 49 AD, Tsi Yung, a Han governor of [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaodong]], allied with the [[Wuhuan]] and [[Xianbei]], attacked the Northern Xiongnu.<ref name=Rene0>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/39 39] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/39 }}</ref>\nThe Northern Xiongnu suffered two major defeats: one at the hands of the Xianbei in 85 AD, and by the Han during the [[Battle of Ikh Bayan]], in 89 AD.

Consequently, in 50 AD, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to tributary relations with Han China. The system of tribute was considerably tightened by the Han, to keep the Southern Xiongnu under control. The ''chanyu'' was ordered to establish his court in the Meiji district of [[Xihe Commandery]] and the Southern Xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies. At the same time, large numbers of Chinese were also resettled in these commanderies, in mixed Han-Xiongnu settlements. Economically, the Southern Xiongnu became reliant on trade with the Han.\n\nTensions were evident between Han settlers and practitioners of the nomadic way of life. Thus, in 94, Anguo Chanyu joined forces with newly subjugated Xiongnu from the north and started a large scale rebellion against the Han.\n\nDuring the late 2nd century AD, the southern Xiongnu were drawn into the rebellions then plaguing the Han court. In 188, the ''chanyu'' was murdered by some of his own subjects for agreeing to send troops to help the Han suppress a rebellion in [[Hebei]] \u2013 many of the Xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the Han court. The murdered ''chanyu's'' son [[Yufuluo]], entitled Chizhisizhu ({{lang|zh|\u6301\u81f3\u5c38\u9010\u4faf}}), succeeded him, but was then overthrown by the same rebellious faction in 189. He travelled to [[Luoyang]] (the Han capital) to seek aid from the Han court, but at this time the Han court was in disorder from the clash between Grand General [[He Jin]] and the eunuchs, and the intervention of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]]. The ''chanyu'' had no choice but to settle down with his followers in [[Linfen|Pingyang]], a city in [[Shanxi]]. In 195, he died and was succeeded as ''chanyu'' by his brother [[Huchuquan Chanyu]].\n\nIn 215\u2013216 AD, the warlord-statesman [[Cao Cao]] detained [[Huchuquan Chanyu]] in the city of [[Ye, China|Ye]], and divided his followers in Shanxi into five divisions: left, right, south, north, and centre. This was aimed at preventing the exiled Xiongnu in Shanxi from engaging in rebellion, and also allowed Cao Cao to use the Xiongnu as auxiliaries in his cavalry.\n\nLater the Xiongnu aristocracy in Shanxi changed their surname from [[Luanti]] to Liu for prestige reasons, claiming that they were related to the Han imperial clan through the old intermarriage policy. After Huchuquan, the Southern Xiongnu were partitioned into five local tribes.  Each local chief was under the \"surveillance of a chinese resident\", while the shanyu was in \"semicaptivity at the imperial court.\"<ref name=Rene111>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 54] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 }}</ref>\n\n=== Later Xiongnu states in northern China ===\nThe Southern Xiongnu that settled in northern China during the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] retained their tribal affiliation and political organization and played an active role in Chinese politics.  During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (304\u2013439 CE), Southern Xiongnu leaders founded or ruled several kingdoms, including [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]]'s [[Han Zhao]] Kingdom (also known as [[Former Zhao]]), [[Helian Bobo]]'s [[Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xia]] and [[Juqu Mengxun]]'s [[Northern Liang]]\n==== Former Zhao state (304\u2013329) ====\n\n{{Main|Former Zhao}}\n\n;Han Zhao dynasty (304\u2013318)\nIn 304, [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]] became Chanyu of the Five Hordes.

In 311, his son and successor [[Liu Cong (Han Zhao)|Liu Cong]] captured [[Luoyang]], and with it the [[Emperor Huai of Jin China]].\n\nIn 316, the [[Emperor Min of Jin China]] was captured in [[Chang'an]].  Both emperors were humiliated as cupbearers in [[Linfen]] before being executed in 313 and 318.\n\nNorth China came under Xiongnu rule while the remnants of the Jin dynasty survived in the south at [[Jiankang]].<ref name=Rene1011>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/56 56\u201357] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/56 }}</ref>\n\n;The reign of Liu Yao (318\u2013329)\nIn 318, after suppressing a coup by a powerful minister in the Xiongnu-Han court, in which the emperor and a large proportion of the aristocracy were massacred), the Xiongnu prince [[Liu Yao]] moved the Xiongnu-Han capital from Pingyang to Chang'an and renamed the dynasty as Zhao (Liu Yuan had declared the empire's name Han to create a linkage with Han Dynasty\u2014to which he claimed he was a descendant, through a princess, but Liu Yao felt that it was time to end the linkage with Han and explicitly restore the linkage to the great Xiongnu chanyu [[Modu Chanyu|Maodun]], and therefore decided to change the name of the state.

The purpose of raiding China was not simply for goods, but to force the Chinese to pay regular tribute. The power of the Xiongnu ruler was based on his control of Chinese tribute which he used to reward his supporters. The Han and Xiongnu empires rose at the same time because the Xiongnu state depended on Chinese tribute.  A major Xiongnu weakness was the custom of lateral succession. If a dead ruler's son was not old enough to take command, power passed to the late ruler's brother. This worked in the first generation but could lead to civil war in the second generation. The first time this happened, in 60 BC, the weaker party adopted what Barfield calls the 'inner frontier strategy.'  They moved south and submitted to China and then used Chinese resources to defeat the Northern Xiongnu and re-establish the empire.  The second time this happened, about 47 AD, the strategy failed. The southern ruler was unable to defeat the northern ruler and the Xiongnu remained divided.<ref>{{Citation|last=Barfield|first=Thomas J|title=The Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China, 221 BC to AD 1757|year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== Ethnolinguistic origins{{anchor|Language}} ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Pronunciation of \u5308<br /> <small>Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929174528/http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=%5Cdata%5Cchina%5Cbigchina&first=1&text_character=%E5%8C%88 http://starling.rinet.ru]</small>\n|-\n|Preclassic [[Old Chinese]]: || {{IPA|s\u014bo\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Classic Old Chinese: || {{IPA-ltc|\u014b\u030ao\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Postclassic Old Chinese: || {{IPA|ho\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Middle Chinese]]: || {{IPA|x\u00f6u\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Standard Mandarin|Modern Mandarin]]: || {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1}}\n|}\n[[File:East-Hem 300ad.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Xiongnu and other steppe nations in 300 AD.]]\n\nThe Chinese name for the Xiongnu was a [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative term in itself]], as the characters (\u5308\u5974) have the meaning of \"fierce slave\".<ref name=yuuu86-384 /> (The Chinese characters are pronounced as ''Xi\u014dngn\u00fa'' {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1|n|u|2}} in modern [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]].)\n\nThere are several theories on the ethnolinguistic identity of the Xiongnu.\n\n=== Huns ===\n{{see also|Origin of the Huns}}\nThe sound of the first Chinese character (\u5308) in the name has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/q\u02b0o\u014b/}} in Old Chinese.<ref>Baxter-Sagart (2014).</ref> This sound has a possible similarity with the name \"[[Huns|Hun]]\" in European languages.

It could lend credence to the theory that the Huns were in fact descendants of the Northern Xiongnu who migrated westward, or that the Huns were using a name borrowed from the Northern Xiongnu, or that these Xiongnu made up part of the Hun confederation.\n\nThe Xiongnu-Hun hypothesis originated with the 18th-century French historian [[Joseph de Guignes]], who noticed that ancient Chinese scholars had referred to members of tribes associated with the Xiongnu by names similar to \"Hun\", albeit with varying Chinese characters.

Three mirrors were acquired from three different graves at the site. The mirror found at feature 160 is believed to be a low-quality, local imitation of a Han mirror, while the whole mirror found at feature 100 and fragments of a mirror found at feature 109 are believed to belong to the classical TLV mirrors and date back to the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]] or the early to middle [[Eastern han|Eastern Han period]].<ref name=\"Lai 34\u201343\">{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Guolong|title=The Date of the TLV Mirrors from the Xiongnu Tombs|journal=The Silk Road|volume=4|issue=1|pages=34\u201343|url=http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol4num1/srnewsletter_v4n1.pdf}}</ref> The archaeologists have chosen to, for the most part, refrain from positing anything about Han-Xiongnu relations based on these particular mirrors. However, they were willing to mention the following: <blockquote>\"There is no clear indication of the ethnicity of this tomb occupant, but in a similar brick-chambered tomb of the late Eastern Han period at the same cemetery, archaeologists discovered a bronze seal with the official title that the Han government bestowed upon the leader of the Xiongnu. The excavators suggested that these brick chamber tombs all belong to the Xiongnu (Qinghai 1993).\"<ref name=\"Lai 34\u201343\" /></blockquote>Classifications of these burial sites make distinction between two prevailing type of burials: \"(1) monumental ramped terrace tombs which are often flanked by smaller \"satellite\" burials and (2) 'circular' or 'ring' burials.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Bryan|title=Xiongnu Archaeology|year=2011|publisher=Vor- und Fruhgeschichtliche Archaologie Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn|location=Bonn|isbn=978-3-936490-14-5|url=http://www.vfgarch.uni-bonn.de/veroeffentlichungen/bonn-bonn-contributions-to-asian-archaeology/bcaa-5-toc|editor=Jan Bemmann|page=23}}</ref> Some scholars consider this a division between \"elite\" graves and \"commoner\" graves.

An example of animal predation associated with Xiongnu culture is a tiger carrying dead prey.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> We see a similar image in work from Maoqinggou, a site which is presumed to have been under Xiongnu political control but is still clearly non-Xiongnu. From Maoqinggou, we see the prey replaced by an extension of the tiger's foot. The work also depicts a lower level of execution; Maoqinggou work was executed in a rounder, less detailed style.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> In its broadest sense, Xiongnu iconography of animal predation include examples such as the gold headdress from Aluchaideng and gold earrings with a turquoise and jade inlay discovered in Xigouban, Inner Mongolia.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The gold headdress can be viewed, along with some other examples of Xiongnu art, from the external links at the bottom of this article.\n\nXiongnu art is harder to distinguish from [[Saka]] or [[Scythian art]]. There was a similarity present in stylistic execution, but Xiongnu art and Saka art did often differ in terms of iconography. Saka art does not appear to have included predation scenes, especially with dead prey, or same-animal combat. Additionally, Saka art included elements not common to Xiongnu iconography, such as a winged, horned horse.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The two cultures also used two different bird heads. Xiongnu depictions of birds have a tendency to have a moderate eye and beak and have ears, while Saka birds have a pronounced eye and beak and no ears.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}} Some scholars{{who|date=November 2014}} claim these differences are indicative of cultural differences. Scholar Sophia-Karin Psarras claims that Xiongnu images of animal predation, specifically tiger plus prey, is spiritual, representative of death and rebirth, and same-animal combat is representative of the acquisition of or maintenance of power.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}}\n\n=== Rock art and writing ===\nThe rock art of the [[Yin Mountains|Yin]] and [[Helan Mountains]] is dated from the 9th millennium BC to the 19th century AD. It consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and only minimally of painted images.<ref>Dematt\u00e8 2006</ref>\n\nExcavations conducted between 1924 and 1925 in the Noin-Ula kurgans produced objects with over twenty carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to that of to the runic letters of the [[Old Turkic alphabet]] discovered in the [[Orkhon Valley]]. From this a some scholars hold that the Xiongnu had a script similar to Eurasian runiform and this alphabet itself served as the basis for the ancient Turkic writing.<ref>Ishjamts 1996: 166</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (vol. [[:zh:s:\u53f2\u8a18/\u5377110|110]]) state that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood; they also mention a \"Hu script\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Fig6Ishjamts p166R1.gif|2nd century BCE \u2013 2nd century CE characters of Hun-[[Xianbei]] script (Mongolia and Inner Mongolia), N.

According to several historians, it is possible that this unknown tribe was originally of [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] origin and joined the Xiongnu confederation. Later the tribes ruling family returned to Korea and married into the royal family of Silla. There are also some Korean researchers that point out that the grave goods of Silla and of the eastern Xiongnu are alike.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Cho Gab-je|date= |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\u9a0e\u99ac\ud749\ub178\uad6d\uac00 \u65b0\u7f85 \uc5f0\uad6c\u3000\u8d99\u7532\u6fdf(\u6708\u520a\u671d\u9bae \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc7a5)\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35\ucde8\uc7ac\u3000\ub0b4 \ubab8\uc18d\uc744 \ud750\ub974\ub294 \ud749\ub178\uc758 \ud53c|publisher=[[Monthly Chosun]]|url=http://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?nNewsNumb=200403100027&ctcd=&cpage=1|accessdate=2016-09-25|author-link= Cho Gab-je}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=\uae40\uc6b4\ud68c|date=2005-08-30 |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\uae40\uc6b4\ud68c\uc758 '\ub300\uc96c\uc2e0\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544\uc11c' <23> \uae08\uad00\uc758 \ub098\ub77c, \uc2e0\ub77c\u201d|publisher=\ud504\ub808\uc2dc\uc548|url=http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=40050830181724&Section=04|accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=|date=2009-02-27 |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\uacbd\uc8fc \uc0ac\ucc9c\uc655\uc0ac(\u5bfa) \uc0ac\ucc9c\uc655\uc0c1(\u56db\u5929\u738b\u50cf) \uc65c 4\uac1c\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c 3\uac1c\uc77c\uae4c|publisher=\uc870\uc120\uc77c\ubcf4|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/26/2009022601873.html|accessdate=2016-09-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230090440/http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/26/2009022601873.html|archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref><ref>\uae40\ucc3d\ud638, \u3008\ubb38\ubb34\uc655\ub989\ube44\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uc870\uc0c1\uc778\uc2dd \u2013 \ud0dc\uc870\uc131\ud55c\uc758 \ucca8\ubcf4 -\u3009, \u300a\ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\uc5f0\uad6c\u300b, \ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\uc5f0\uad6c\ud68c, 1986\ub144</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nl.go.kr/nl/search/SearchDetail.nl?category_code=ct&service=KOLIS&vdkvgwkey=14167918&colltype=YON_ART&place_code_info=132&place_name_info=%EC%97%B0%EC%86%8D%EA%B0%84%ED%96%89%EB%AC%BC%EC%8B%A4(3%EC%B8%B5)&manage_code=MA&shape_code=B&refLoc=portal&category=storage&srchFlag=Y&h_kwd=%E6%96%B0%E7%BE%85%E5%BB%BA%E5%9C%8B%E8%A8%AD%E8%A9%B1%EC%9D%98+%E7%A1%8F%E7%A9%B6%7C4%E8%BC%AF(1972%EB%85%84+5%EC%9B%94),+p.+1-52|title=\uc790\ub8cc\uac80\uc0c9>\uc0c1\uc138_\uae30\uc0ac {{!}} \uad6d\ub9bd\uc911\uc559\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00|website=www.nl.go.kr|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Chanyu#List of Xiongnu Chanyus|List of Xiongnu rulers (Chanyus)]]\n* [[Chanyu#Chanyu family trees|Rulers family tree]]\n* [[Nomadic empire]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[History of the Han Dynasty]]\n* [[Ban Yong]]\n* [[Zubu]]\n* [[List of largest empires]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Primary sources\n* [[Ban Gu]] et al., ''[[Book of Han]]'', esp. vol. 94, [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377094\u4e0a|part 1]], [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377094\u4e0b|part 2]].\n* [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] et al., ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', esp.
