''[[The Washington Post]]'' called her \"dancer Katherine the Great\". For almost 30 years she maintained the [[Katherine Dunham Company|Katherine Dunham Dance Company]], the only self-supported American black dance troupe at that time.

Her father, Albert Millard Dunham, was a descendant of slaves from West Africa and [[Madagascar]]. Her mother, Fanny June Dunham (n\u00e9e Taylor), who was of [[French-Canadian]] heritage, died when Dunham was three years old.

In a lecture by [[Robert Redfield]], a professor of anthropology, she learned that much of black culture in modern America had begun in Africa. She decided to major in anthropology and to study dances of the [[African diaspora]]. Besides Redfield, she studied under anthropologists such as [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A.R. Radcliffe-Brown]], [[Edward Sapir]], and [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]]. Under their tutelage, she showed great promise in her ethnographic studies of dance.<ref>Ira E. Harrison and Faye V. Harrison, ''African-American Pioneers in Anthropology'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999), p. 139.</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Dunham was awarded travel fellowships from the [[Julius Rosenwald Foundation|Julius Rosenwald]] and Guggenheim foundations to conduct ethnographic study of the dance forms of the Caribbean, especially as manifested in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun]] practice of [[Haiti]]. Fellow anthropology student [[Zora Neale Hurston]] also did field work in the Caribbean. Dunham also received a grant to work with Professor [[Melville Herskovits]] of [[Northwestern University]], whose ideas about retention of African culture among African Americans served as a base for her research in the Caribbean.\n\nHer field work in the Caribbean began in [[Jamaica]], where she lived for several months in the remote Maroon village of [[Accompong]], deep in the mountains of  [[Cockpit Country]]. (She later wrote ''Journey to Accompong'', a book describing her experiences there.) Then she traveled to [[Martinique]] and to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] for short stays, primarily to do an investigation of [[Shango]], the African god who was still considered an important presence in West Indian religious culture. Early in 1936, she arrived in [[Haiti]], where she remained for several months, the first of her many extended stays in that country through her life.\n\nWhile in Haiti, Dunham investigated [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun]] rituals and made extensive research notes, particularly on the dance movements of the participants. Years later, after extensive studies and initiations, she became a [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]] in the Vodun religion. She also became friends with, among others, [[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]], then a high-level politician, who became president of Haiti in 1949. Somewhat later, she assisted him, at considerable risk to her life, when he was persecuted for his progressive policies and sent in exile to Jamaica after a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nDunham returned to Chicago in the late spring of 1936. In August she was awarded a bachelor's degree, a Ph.B., bachelor of philosophy, with her principal area of study named as [[social anthropology]]. She was one of the first African-American women to attend this college and to earn these degrees.<ref name=kdcah/> In 1938, using materials collected during her research tour of the Caribbean, Dunham submitted a thesis, ''The Dances of Haiti: A Study of Their Material Aspect, Organization, Form, and Function,'' to the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree, but she never completed her course work or took required examinations to complete the degree. Devoted to dance performance, as well as to anthropological research, she realized that she had to choose between the two. Although Dunham was offered another grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to pursue her academic studies, she chose dance, gave up her graduate studies, and departed for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Hollywood]].<ref name=timeline/>\n\n==Dancer and choreographer==\n===From 1928 to 1938===\n[[File:Katherine Dunham by Van Vechten cph.3b46690.jpg|thumb|right|Katherine Dunham in 1940, by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]\nIn 1928, while still an undergraduate, Dunham began to study ballet with Ludmilla Speranzeva, a Russian dancer who had settled in Chicago, after having come to the United States with the Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Chauve-Souris,'' directed by impresario Nikita Balieff. Dunham also studied ballet with Mark Turbyfill and [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]], who became prima ballerina of the [[Chicago Opera]]. Through her ballet teachers, she was also exposed to Spanish, East Indian, Javanese, and Balinese dance forms.<ref>Aschenbenner, ''Katherine Dunham: Dancing a Life'', p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1931, at the age of 21, Dunham formed a group called ''Ballets N\u00e8gres,'' one of the first black ballet companies in the United States. After a single, well-received performance in 1931, the group was disbanded. Encouraged by Speranzeva to focus on modern dance instead of ballet, Dunham opened her first dance school in 1933, calling it the Negro Dance Group. It was a venue for Dunham to teach young black dancers about their African heritage.\n\nIn 1934\u20131936, Dunham performed as a guest artist with the ballet company of the Chicago Opera. Ruth Page had written a scenario and choreographed ''La Guiablesse'' (\"The Devil Woman\"), based on a Martinican folk tale in [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s ''Two Years in the French West Indies''. It opened in Chicago in 1933, with a black cast and with Page dancing the title role. The next year the production was repeated with Katherine Dunham in the lead and with students from Dunham's Negro Dance Group in the ensemble. Her dance career was interrupted by her travel to the Caribbean for anthropological research.\n\nHaving completed her undergraduate work at the University of Chicago and decided to pursue a performing career rather than academic studies, Dunham revived her dance ensemble. In 1937 she traveled with them to New York to take part in ''A Negro Dance Evening'', organized by [[Edna Guy]] at the 92nd Street YMHA. The troupe performed a suite of West Indian dances in the first half of the program and a ballet entitled ''Tropic Death'', with [[Talley Beatty]], in the second half. Upon returning to Chicago, the company performed at the [[Goodman Theater]] and at the Abraham Lincoln Center. Dunham created ''Rara Tonga'' and ''Woman with a Cigar'' at this time, which became well known. With choreography characterized by exotic sexuality, both became signature works in the Dunham repertory. After her company performed successfully, Dunham was chosen as dance director of the Chicago Negro Theater Unit of the [[Federal Theatre Project]]. In this post, she choreographed the Chicago production of ''Run Li'l Chil'lun'', performed at the Goodman Theater. She also created several other works of choreography, including ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' (a response to the play by [[Eugene O'Neill]]) and ''Barrelhouse''.\n\nAt this time Dunham first became associated with designer John Pratt, whom she later married. Together, they produced the first version of her dance composition ''L'Ag'Ya'', which premiered on January 27, 1938, as a part of the Federal Theater Project in Chicago. Based on her research in Martinique, this three-part performance integrated elements of a Martinique fighting dance into American ballet.\n\n===From 1939 to the late 1950s===\nIn 1939, Dunham's company gave additional performances in Chicago and Cincinnati and then returned to New York. Dunham had been invited to stage a new number for the popular, long-running musical revue ''Pins and Needles 1940'', produced by the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers Union]]. As this show continued its run at the Windsor Theater, Dunham booked her own company in the theater for a Sunday performance. This concert, billed as ''Tropics'' and ''Le Hot Jazz'', included not only her favorite partners [[Archie Savage]] and [[Talley Beatty]], but her principal Haitian drummer, [[Papa Augustin]]. Initially scheduled for a single performance, the show was so popular that the troupe repeated it for another ten Sundays.\n\nBased on this success, the entire company was engaged for the 1940 Broadway production ''[[Cabin in the Sky (musical)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', staged by [[George Balanchine]] and starring [[Ethel Waters]]. With Dunham in the sultry role of temptress Georgia Brown, the show ran for 20 weeks in New York. It next moved to the West Coast for an extended run of performances there. The show created a minor controversy in the press.<!-- Explain what it was -->\n\nAfter the national tour of ''Cabin in the Sky'', the Dunham company stayed in [[Los Angeles]], where they appeared in the [[Warner Brothers]] short film ''Carnival of Rhythm'' (1941). The next year, after the US entered World War II, Dunham appeared in the Paramount musical film ''Star Spangled Rhythm'' (1942) in a specialty number, \"Sharp as a Tack,\" with [[Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson]]. Other movies she performed in as a dancer during this period included the [[Abbott and Costello]] comedy ''[[Pardon My Sarong]]'' (1942) and the black musical ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'' (1943), which featured a stellar range of actors, musicians and dancers.<ref>Claude Conyers, \"Film Choreography by Katherine Dunham, 1939\u20131964,\" in Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), pp. 639\u201342.</ref>\n\nThe company returned to New York. In September 1943, under the management of the impresario [[Sol Hurok]], her troupe opened in ''Tropical Review'' at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theater]]. Featuring lively Latin American and Caribbean dances, plantation dances, and American social dances, the show was an immediate success. The original two-week engagement was extended by popular demand into a three-month run, after which the company embarked on an extensive tour of the United States and Canada. In Boston, then a bastion of conservatism, the show was banned in 1944 after only one performance. Although it was well received by the audience, local censors feared that the revealing costumes and provocative dances might compromise public morals. After the tour, in 1945, the Dunham company appeared in the short-lived ''Blue Holiday'' at the [[Belasco Theater]] in New York, and in the more successful ''Carib Song'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]]. The finale to the first act of this show was ''Shango'', a staged interpretation of a Vodun ritual, which became a permanent part of the company's repertory.\n\nIn 1946, Dunham returned to Broadway for a revue entitled ''Bal N\u00e8gre'', which received glowing notices from theater and dance critics. Early in 1947 Dunham choreographed the musical play ''Windy City'', which premiered at the Great Northern Theater in Chicago. Later in the year she opened a cabaret show in [[Las Vegas]], during the first year that the city became a popular entertainment as well as gambling destination. Later that year she took her troupe to Mexico, where their performances were so popular that they stayed and performed for more than two months. After Mexico, Dunham began touring in Europe, where she was an immediate sensation. In 1948, she opened ''A Caribbean Rhapsody'', first at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in London, and then took it to the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris.\n\nThis was the beginning of more than 20 years during which Dunham performed with her company almost exclusively outside the United States. During these years, the Dunham company appeared in some 33 countries in Europe, North Africa, South America, Australia, and East Asia. Dunham continued to develop dozens of new productions during this period, and the company met with enthusiastic audiences in every city. Despite these successes, the company frequently ran into periods of financial difficulties, as Dunham was required to support all of the 30 to 40 dancers and musicians.\n\nDunham and her company appeared in the Hollywood movie ''[[Casbah (film)|Casbah]]'' (1948) with [[Tony Martin (American singer)|Tony Martin]], [[Yvonne De Carlo]], and [[Peter Lorre]], and in the Italian film ''Botta e Risposta'', produced by Dino de Laurentiis. Also that year they appeared in the first ever, hour-long American spectacular televised by [[NBC]], when television was first beginning to spread across America. This was followed by television spectaculars filmed in London, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Sydney, and Mexico City.\n\nIn 1950, Sol Hurok presented Katherine Dunham and Her Company in a dance revue at the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theater]] in New York, with a program composed of some of Dunham's best works. It closed after only 38 performances. The company soon embarked on a tour of venues in South America, Europe, and North Africa. They had particular success in Denmark and France. In the mid-1950s, Dunham and her company appeared in three films: ''Mambo'' (1954), made in Italy; ''Die Grosse Starparade'' (1954), made in Germany; and ''M\u00fasica en la Noche'' (1955), made in Mexico City.\n\n===Later career===\nThe Dunham company's international tours ended in Vienna in 1960. They were stranded without money because of bad management by their impresario. Dunham saved the day by arranging for the company to be paid to appear in a German television special, ''Karibische Rhythmen'', after which they returned to the United States. Dunham's last appearance on Broadway was in 1962 in ''Bamboche!'', which included a few former Dunham dancers in the cast and a contingent of dancers and drummers from the Royal Troupe of Morocco. It was not a success, closing after only eight performances.\n\nA highlight of Dunham's later career was the invitation from New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]] to stage dances for a new production of ''[[Aida]]'', starring soprano [[Leontyne Price]]. In 1963, she became the first African American to choreograph for the Met since [[Hemsley Winfield]] set the dances for ''The Emperor Jones'' in 1933. The critics acknowledged the historical research she did on dance in ancient Egypt, but they were not appreciative of her choreography as staged for this production.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E1D91E3DE731A25753C2A9669D946291D6CF |title=Dunham's Dances and Verdi's 'Aida' |date=October 20, 1963 |accessdate=March 7, 2015 | author=Hughes, Allen |location=New York City, NY |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Dunham undertook various choreographic commissions at several venues in the United States and in Europe. In 1967 she officially retired, after presenting a final show at the famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem, New York]]. Even in retirement Dunham continued to choreograph: one of her major works was directing the premiere full, posthumous production [[Scott Joplin]]'s opera ''[[Treemonisha]]'' in 1972, a joint production of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Morehouse College]] chorus in Atlanta, conducted by [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Southern, Eileen|title=The Music of Black Americans|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.|year=1997|page=237|isbn=0-393-03843-2|ref=Southern}}</ref> This work was never produced in Joplin's lifetime, but since the 1970s, it has been successfully produced in many venues.\n\nIn 1978 Dunham was featured in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] special, ''Divine Drumbeats: Katherine Dunham and Her People'', narrated by [[James Earl Jones]], as part of the ''Dance in America'' series. [[Alvin Ailey]] later produced a tribute for her in 1987\u201388 at [[Carnegie Hall]] with his [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater|American Dance Theater]], entitled ''The Magic of Katherine Dunham.''\n\n==Educator and writer==\n[[File:Katherine Dunham 1963.jpg|thumb|Katherine Dunham 1963]]\nIn 1945, Dunham opened and directed the '''Katherine Dunham School''' of Dance and Theatre near [[Times Square]] in New York City. Her dance company was provided with rent-free studio space for three years by an admirer and patron, [[Lee Shubert]]; it had an initial enrollment of 350 students.\n\nThe program included courses in dance, drama, performing arts, applied skills, humanities, cultural studies, and Caribbean research. In 1947 it was expanded and granted a charter as the Katherine Dunham School of Cultural Arts. The school was managed in Dunham's absence by [[Syvilla Fort]], one of her dancers, and thrived for about 10 years. It was considered one of the best learning centers of its type at the time. Schools inspired by it were later opened in Stockholm, Paris, and Rome by dancers who had been trained by Dunham.\n\nHer alumni included many future celebrities, such as [[Eartha Kitt]]. As a teenager, she won a scholarship to the Dunham school and later became a dancer with the company, before beginning her successful singing career. Dunham and Kitt collaborated again in the 1970s in an Equity Production of the musical ''Peg,'' based on the Irish play, ''Peg O' My Heart.'' Dunham Company member Dana McBroom-Manno was selected as a featured artist in the show, which played on the Music Fair Circuit.\n\nOthers who attended her school included [[James Dean]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Jose Ferrer]], [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Warren Beatty]]. [[Marlon Brando]] frequently dropped in to play the bongo drums, and jazz musician [[Charles Mingus]] held regular jam sessions with the drummers. Known for her many innovations, Dunham developed a dance pedagogy, later named the Dunham Technique, a style of movement and exercises based in traditional African dances, to support her choreography. This won international acclaim and is now taught as a modern dance style in many dance schools.\n\nBy 1957, Dunham was under severe personal strain, which was affecting her health. She decided to live for a year in relative isolation in [[Kyoto, Japan]], where she worked on writing memoirs of her youth. The first work, entitled ''A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood'', was published in 1959. A continuation based on her experiences in Haiti, ''Island Possessed'', was published in 1969. A fictional work based on her African experiences, ''Kasamance: A Fantasy'', was published in 1974. Throughout her career, Dunham occasionally published articles about her anthropological research (sometimes under the pseudonym of Kaye Dunn) and sometimes lectured on anthropological topics at universities and scholarly societies.<ref>See \"Selected Bibliography of Writings by Katherine Dunham\" in Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), pp. 643\u201346.</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Dunham was commissioned to choreograph ''Aida'' at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera Company]], with [[Leontyne Price]] in the title role. Members of Dunham's last New York Company auditioned to become members of the Met Ballet Company. Among her dancers selected were Marcia McBroom, Dana McBroom, Jean Kelly, and Jesse Oliver. The Met Ballet Company dancers studied Dunham Technique at Dunham's 42nd Street dance studio for the entire summer leading up to the season opening of ''Aida.'' [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was in the audience for opening night. Dunham's background as an anthropologist gave the dances of the opera a new authenticity. She was also consulted on costuming for the Egyptian and Ethiopian dress. Dana McBroom-Manno still teaches Dunham Technique in New York City and is a Master of Dunham Technique.\n\nIn 1964, Dunham settled in [[East St. Louis]], and took up the post of artist-in-residence at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|Southern Illinois University]] in nearby [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]]. There she was able to bring anthropologists, sociologists, educational specialists, scientists, writers, musicians, and theater people together to create a liberal arts curriculum that would be a foundation for further college work. One of her fellow professors, with whom she collaborated, was architect [[Buckminster Fuller]].\n\nThe following year, 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] nominated Dunham to be technical cultural adviser\u2014 a sort of cultural ambassador\u2014to the government of [[Senegal]] in West Africa. Her mission was to help train the Senegalese National Ballet and to assist President [[Leopold Senghor]] with arrangements for the [[World Festival of Negro Arts|First Pan-African World Festival of Negro Arts]] in [[Dakar]] (1965\u201366). Later Dunham  established a second home in Senegal, and she occasionally returned there to scout for talented African musicians and dancers.\n\nIn 1967, Dunham opened the [[Performing Arts Training Center]] (PATC) in [[East St. Louis]] in an effort to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. The restructuring of heavy industry had caused the loss of many working-class jobs, and unemployment was high in the city. After the 1968 riots following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King]], Dunham encouraged gang members in the ghetto to come to the Center to use drumming and dance to vent their frustrations. The PATC teaching staff was made up of former members of Dunham's touring company, as well as local residents. While trying to help the young people in the community, Dunham was arrested. This gained international headlines and the embarrassed local police officials quickly released her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students. She lectured every summer until her death at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis, which attracted dance students from around the world. She established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her personal collection.\n\nIn 1976, Dunham was guest artist-in-residence and lecturer for Afro-American studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. A photographic exhibit honoring her achievements, entitled ''Kaiso! Katherine Dunham,'' was mounted at the Women's Center on the campus. In 1978, an anthology of writings by and about her, also entitled ''Kaiso! Katherine Dunham'', was published in a limited, numbered edition of 130 copies by the Institute for the Study of Social Change.\n\n==Social activism==\nThe Katherine Dunham Company toured throughout North America in the mid-1940s, performing as well in the [[Racial segregation in the United States#In the South|racially segregated South]]. Dunham refused to hold a show in one theater after finding out that the city's black residents had not been allowed to buy tickets for the performance. On another occasion, in October 1944, after getting a rousing standing ovation in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], she told the all-white audience that she and her company would not return because \"your management will not allow people like you to sit next to people like us.\" She expressed a hope that time and the \"war for tolerance and democracy\" (this was during World War II) would bring a change.<ref>Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), p. 252.</ref> One historian noted that \"during the course of the tour, Dunham and the troupe had recurrent problems with racial discrimination, leading her to a posture of militancy which was to characterize her subsequent career.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn Hollywood, Dunham refused to sign a lucrative studio contract when the producer said she would have to replace some of her darker-skinned company members. She and her company frequently had difficulties finding adequate accommodations while on tour because in many regions of the country, black Americans were not allowed to stay at hotels.\n\nWhile Dunham was recognized as \"unofficially\" representing American cultural life in her foreign tours, she was given very little assistance of any kind by the U.S. State Department. She had incurred the displeasure of departmental officials when her company performed ''Southland'', a ballet that dramatized the lynching of a black man in the racist American South. Its premiere performance on December 9, 1950, at the Teatro Municipal in [[Santiago, Chile]],<ref>\"Hoy programa extraordinario y el s\u00e1bado dos estamos nos ofrece Katherine Dunham,\" ''El Mercurio'' (Santiago, Chile), Thursday, December 7, 1950.</ref><ref>Joanna Dee Das, [http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/dunham_essay_deedas.pdf \"Katherine Dunham (1909-2006)\"], Dance Heritage Coalition.</ref> generated considerable public interest in the early months of 1951.<ref>Constance Valis Hill, \"Katherine Dunham's ''Southland'': Protest in the Face of Repression,\" reprinted in Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), pp. 345\u201363.</ref> The State Department was dismayed by the negative view of American society that the ballet presented to foreign audiences. As a result, Dunham would later experience some diplomatic \"difficulties\" on her tours. The State Department regularly subsidized other less well-known groups, but it consistently refused to support her company (even when it was entertaining U.S. Army troops), although at the same time it did not hesitate to take credit for them as \"unofficial artistic and cultural representatives.\"\n\n===The Afonso Arinos Law in Brazil===\nIn 1950, while visiting [[Brazil]], Dunham and her group were refused rooms at a first-class hotel in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the Hotel Esplanada, frequented by many American businessmen. Understanding that the fact was due to racial discrimination, she made sure the incident was publicized. The incident was widely discussed in the Brazilian press and became a hot political issue. In response, the Afonso Arinos law was passed in 1951 that made racial discrimination in public places a felony in Brazil.<ref>Edward E.

Whitten Jr. (eds), ''Blackness in Latin American and Caribbean'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988), p. 117.</ref>\n\n===Hunger strike===\nIn 1992, at age 83, Dunham went on a highly publicized [[hunger strike]] to protest the discriminatory U.S. foreign policy against [[Haitian boat-people]].\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that, \"she went on a 47-day hunger strike to protest the U.S.'s forced repatriation of Haitian refugees. \"My job\", she said, \"is to create a useful legacy.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198884-2,00.html ''Time'' magazine article]</ref> During her protest, [[Dick Gregory]] led a non-stop vigil at her home, where many disparate personalities came to show their respect, such [[Debbie Allen]], [[Jonathan Demme]], and [[Louis Farrakhan]], leader of the [[Nation of Islam]].\n\nThis initiative drew international publicity to the plight of the Haitian boat-people and U.S. discrimination against them. Dunham ended her fast only after exiled Haitian president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] and [[Jesse Jackson]] came to her and personally requested that she stop risking her life for this cause.  In recognition of her stance, President Aristide later awarded her a medal of Haiti's highest honor.\n\n==Private life==\nDunham married Jordis McCoo, a black postal worker, in 1931, but he did not share her interests and they gradually drifted apart, finally divorcing in 1938. About that time Dunham met and began to work with John Thomas Pratt, a Canadian who had become one of America's most renowned costume and theatrical set designers. Pratt, who was white, shared Dunham's interests in African-Caribbean cultures and was happy to put his talents in her service. After he became her artistic collaborator, they became romantically involved. In the summer of 1941, after the national tour of ''Cabin in the Sky'' ended, they went to Mexico, where inter-racial marriages were less controversial than in the United States, and engaged in a commitment ceremony on 20 July, which thereafter they gave as the date of their wedding.<ref>Katherine Dunham, ''The Minefield'' (manuscript, c. 1980\u201385), book II, 122\u2013123, Box 20, Katherine Dunham Papers, Missouri History Museum Library and Research Center, St. Louis.</ref> In fact, that ceremony was not recognized as a legal marriage in the United States, a point of law that would come to trouble them some years later. Katherine Dunham and John Pratt married in 1949 to adopt Marie-Christine, a French 14-month-old baby. From the beginning of their association, around 1938, Pratt designed the sets and every costume Dunham ever wore. He continued as her artistic collaborator until his death in 1986.\n\nWhen she was not performing, Dunham and Pratt often visited Haiti for extended stays. On one of these visits, during the late 1940s, she purchased a large property of more than seven hectares (approximately 17.3 acres) in the Carrefours suburban area of Port-au-Prince, known as Habitation Leclerc. Dunham used Habitation Leclerc as a private retreat for many years, frequently bringing members of her dance company to recuperate from the stress of touring and to work on developing new dance productions. After running it as a tourist spot, with Vodun dancing as entertainment, in the early 1960s, she sold it to a French entrepreneur in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1949, Dunham returned from international touring with her company for a brief stay in the United States, where she suffered a temporary nervous breakdown after the premature death of her beloved brother Albert. He had been a promising philosophy professor at [[Howard University]] and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. During this time, she developed a warm friendship with the psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]], whom she had known in Europe. He was only one of a number of international celebrities who were Dunham's friends. In December 1951, a photo of Dunham dancing with [[Ismaili Muslim]] leader [[Prince Ali Khan]] at a private party he had hosted for her in Paris appeared in a popular magazine and fueled rumors that the two were romantically linked.<ref>''Jet: The Weekly Negro News Magazine'', vol. 1, no. 9 (December 27, 1951).</ref> Both Dunham and the prince denied the suggestion. The prince was then married to actress [[Rita Hayworth]], and Dunham was now legally married to John Pratt; a quiet ceremony in Las Vegas had taken place earlier in the year.<ref>Katherine Dunham, ''The Minefield'' (manuscript, c. 1980-85).</ref> The couple had officially adopted their foster daughter, a 14-month-old girl they had found as an infant in a Roman Catholic convent nursery in Fresnes, France. Named Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, she was their only child.\n\nAmong Dunham's closest friends and colleagues was Julie Robinson, formerly a performer with the Katherine Dunham Company, and her husband, singer and later political activist [[Harry Belafonte]]. Both remained close friends of Dunham for many years, until her death. [[Glory Van Scott]] and [[Jean-L\u00e9on Destin\u00e9]] were among other former Dunham dancers who remained her lifelong friends.<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, \"Katherine Dunham's Legacy, Visible in Youth and Age,\" ''New York Times'' (March 3, 2003).</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn May 21, 2006, Dunham died in her sleep from [[natural causes]] in [[New York City]]. She died a month before her 97th birthday. She wished her family a happy life.\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Katherine Dunham, Dance Icon, Dies at 96|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/arts/dance/23dunham.html|accessdate=September 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Anna Kisselgoff]], a dance critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called Dunham \"a major pioneer in Black theatrical dance ... ahead of her time.\" \"In introducing authentic African dance-movements to her company and audiences, Dunham\u2014perhaps more than any other choreographer of the time\u2014exploded the possibilities of modern dance expression.\"\n\nAs one of her biographers, Joyce Aschenbrenner, wrote: \"Today, it is safe to say, there is no American black dancer who has not been influenced by the Dunham Technique, unless he or she works entirely within a classical genre\", and the Dunham Technique is still taught to anyone who studies modern dance.\n\nThe highly respected ''Dance'' magazine did a feature cover story on Dunham in August 2000 entitled \"One-Woman Revolution.\"  As [[Wendy Perron]] wrote, \"Jazz dance, 'fusion,' and the search for our cultural identity all have their antecedents in Dunham's work as a dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist. She was the first American dancer to present indigenous forms on a concert stage, the first to sustain a black dance company.... She created and performed in works for stage, clubs, and Hollywood films; she started a school and a technique that continue to flourish; she fought unstintingly for racial justice.\"\n\nScholar of the arts [[Harold Cruse]] wrote in 1964: \"Her early and lifelong search for meaning and artistic values for black people, as well as for all peoples, has motivated, created opportunities for, and launched careers for generations of young black artists ... Afro-American dance was usually in the avant-garde of modern dance ... Dunham's entire career spans the period of the emergence of Afro-American dance as a serious art.\"\n\nBlack writer, Arthur Todd, described her as \"one of our national treasures.\" Regarding her impact and effect he wrote: \"The rise of American Negro dance commenced ... when Katherine Dunham and her company skyrocketed into the Windsor Theater in New York, from Chicago in 1940, and made an indelible stamp on the dance world... Miss Dunham opened the doors that made possible the rapid upswing of this dance for the present generation.\" \"What Dunham gave modern dance was a coherent lexicon of African and Caribbean styles of movement\u2014a flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis and isolation of the limbs, a polyrhythmic strategy of moving\u2014which she integrated with techniques of ballet and modern dance.\" \"Her mastery of body movement was considered 'phenomenal.' She was hailed for her smooth and fluent choreography and dominated a stage with what has been described as 'an unmitigating radiant force providing beauty with a feminine touch full of variety and nuance.\"\n\nRichard Buckle, ballet historian and critic, wrote: \"Her company of magnificent dancers and musicians ... met with the success it has and that herself as explorer, thinker, inventor, organizer, and dancer should have reached a place in the estimation of the world, has done more than a million pamphlets could for the service of her people.\"\n\n\"Dunham's European success led to considerable imitation of her work in European revues ... it is safe to say that the perspectives of concert-theatrical dance in Europe were profoundly affected by the performances of the Dunham troupe.\"\n\nWhile in Europe, she also influenced hat styles on the continent as well as spring fashion collections, featuring the Dunham line and Caribbean Rhapsody, and the Chiroteque Fran\u00e7aise made a bronze cast of her feet for a museum of important personalities.\"\n\nThe Katherine Dunham Company became an incubator for many well known performers, including Archie Savage, [[Talley Beatty]], Janet Collins, Lenwood Morris, Vanoye Aikens, Lucille Ellis, Pearl Reynolds, [[Camille Yarbrough]], [[Lavinia Williams]], and Tommy Gomez.\n\n[[Alvin Ailey]], who stated that he first became interested in dance as a professional career after having seen a performance of the Katherine Dunham Company as a young teenager of 14 in Los Angeles, called the Dunham Technique \"the closest thing to a unified Afro-American dance existing.\"\n\nFor several years, Dunham's personal assistant and press promoter was [[Maya Deren]], who later also became interested in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun]] and wrote ''The Divine Horseman: The Voodoo Gods of Haiti'' (1953). Deren is now considered to be a pioneer of independent American filmmaking. Dunham herself was quietly involved in both the Voodoo and [[Orisa]] communities of the Caribbean and the United States, in particular with the [[Lucumi religion|Lucumi]] tradition.\n\nNot only did Dunham shed light on the cultural value of black dance, but she clearly contributed to changing perceptions of blacks in America by showing society that as a black woman, she could be an intelligent scholar, a beautiful dancer, and a skilled choreographer. As Julia Foulkes pointed out, \"Dunham's path to success lay in making high art in the United States from African and Caribbean sources, capitalizing on a heritage of dance within the African Diaspora, and raising perceptions of African American capabilities.\"<ref>Julia L.

Dunham had one of the most successful dance careers in African-American and European theater of the 20th century, and directed her own dance company for many years. She has been called the \"matriarch and queen mother of black dance.\"<ref>Joyce Aschenbenner, ''Katherine Dunham: Dancing a Life'' (Urbana: [[University of Illinois Press]], 2002).</ref>\n\nWhile a student at the [[University of Chicago]], Dunham also performed as a dancer and ran a dance school. Receiving a fellowship, she went to the [[Caribbean]] to study dance and ethnography. She later returned to graduate and submitted a master's thesis in anthropology.  She did not complete the other requirements for that degree, however. She realized that her professional calling was performance.\n\nAt the height of her career in the 1940s and 1950s, Dunham was renowned throughout Europe and Latin America and was widely popular in the United States. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called her \"dancer Katherine the Great\". For almost 30 years she maintained the [[Katherine Dunham Company|Katherine Dunham Dance Company]], the only self-supported American black dance troupe at that time. Over her long career, she choreographed more than ninety individual dances.<ref>V\u00e8V\u00e8 A. Clark and Sara E.

Her father, Albert Millard Dunham, was a descendant of slaves from West Africa and [[Madagascar]]. Her mother, Fanny June Dunham (n\u00e9e Taylor), who was of [[French-Canadian]] heritage, died when Dunham was three years old. She had an older brother, Albert Jr., with whom she had a close relationship.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/dunham/dunham-timeline.html|title=Timeline: The Katherine Dunham Collection at the Library of Congress (Performing Arts Encyclopedia, The Library of Congress)|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> After her father married again a few years later, the family moved to a predominantly white neighborhood in [[Joliet, Illinois]].

In 1921, a short story she wrote when she was 12 years old, called \"Come Back to Arizona\", was published in volume 2 of ''[[The Brownies' Book]].''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nShe graduated from [[Joliet Central High School]] in 1928, where she played baseball, tennis, basketball, and track; served as vice-president of the French Club, and was on the yearbook staff.<ref>Joliet Central High School Yearbook, 1928</ref> In high school she joined the Terpsichorean Club and began to learn a kind of modern dance based on the ideas of Europeans [[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]] and [[Rudolf von Laban]].<ref name=\":0\" /> At the age of 15, she organized \"The Blue Moon Caf\u00e9\", a fundraising cabaret to raise money for Brown's Methodist Church in Joliet, where she gave her first public performance.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://dance.about.com/od/famousdancers/p/Katherine_Dunham.htm|title=Learn About Dancer Katherine Dunham|website=About.com Home|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> While still a high school student, she opened a private dance school for young black children.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Academic anthropologist==\nAfter completing her studies at [[Joliet Junior College]], Dunham moved to Chicago to join her brother Albert, who was attending the [[University of Chicago]] as a student of philosophy. In a lecture by [[Robert Redfield]], a professor of anthropology, she learned that much of black culture in modern America had begun in Africa. She decided to major in anthropology and to study dances of the [[African diaspora]]. Besides Redfield, she studied under anthropologists such as [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A.R. Radcliffe-Brown]], [[Edward Sapir]], and [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]]. Under their tutelage, she showed great promise in her ethnographic studies of dance.<ref>Ira E. Harrison and Faye V. Harrison, ''African-American Pioneers in Anthropology'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999), p. 139.</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Dunham was awarded travel fellowships from the [[Julius Rosenwald Foundation|Julius Rosenwald]] and Guggenheim foundations to conduct ethnographic study of the dance forms of the Caribbean, especially as manifested in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun]] practice of [[Haiti]]. Fellow anthropology student [[Zora Neale Hurston]] also did field work in the Caribbean. Dunham also received a grant to work with Professor [[Melville Herskovits]] of [[Northwestern University]], whose ideas about retention of African culture among African Americans served as a base for her research in the Caribbean.\n\nHer field work in the Caribbean began in [[Jamaica]], where she lived for several months in the remote Maroon village of [[Accompong]], deep in the mountains of  [[Cockpit Country]]. (She later wrote ''Journey to Accompong'', a book describing her experiences there.) Then she traveled to [[Martinique]] and to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] for short stays, primarily to do an investigation of [[Shango]], the African god who was still considered an important presence in West Indian religious culture. Early in 1936, she arrived in [[Haiti]], where she remained for several months, the first of her many extended stays in that country through her life.\n\nWhile in Haiti, Dunham investigated [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun]] rituals and made extensive research notes, particularly on the dance movements of the participants. Years later, after extensive studies and initiations, she became a [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]] in the Vodun religion. She also became friends with, among others, [[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]], then a high-level politician, who became president of Haiti in 1949. Somewhat later, she assisted him, at considerable risk to her life, when he was persecuted for his progressive policies and sent in exile to Jamaica after a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nDunham returned to Chicago in the late spring of 1936. In August she was awarded a bachelor's degree, a Ph.B., bachelor of philosophy, with her principal area of study named as [[social anthropology]]. She was one of the first African-American women to attend this college and to earn these degrees.<ref name=kdcah/> In 1938, using materials collected during her research tour of the Caribbean, Dunham submitted a thesis, ''The Dances of Haiti: A Study of Their Material Aspect, Organization, Form, and Function,'' to the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree, but she never completed her course work or took required examinations to complete the degree. Devoted to dance performance, as well as to anthropological research, she realized that she had to choose between the two. Although Dunham was offered another grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to pursue her academic studies, she chose dance, gave up her graduate studies, and departed for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Hollywood]].<ref name=timeline/>\n\n==Dancer and choreographer==\n===From 1928 to 1938===\n[[File:Katherine Dunham by Van Vechten cph.3b46690.jpg|thumb|right|Katherine Dunham in 1940, by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]\nIn 1928, while still an undergraduate, Dunham began to study ballet with Ludmilla Speranzeva, a Russian dancer who had settled in Chicago, after having come to the United States with the Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Chauve-Souris,'' directed by impresario Nikita Balieff. Dunham also studied ballet with Mark Turbyfill and [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]], who became prima ballerina of the [[Chicago Opera]]. Through her ballet teachers, she was also exposed to Spanish, East Indian, Javanese, and Balinese dance forms.<ref>Aschenbenner, ''Katherine Dunham: Dancing a Life'', p. 26</ref>\n\nIn 1931, at the age of 21, Dunham formed a group called ''Ballets N\u00e8gres,'' one of the first black ballet companies in the United States. After a single, well-received performance in 1931, the group was disbanded. Encouraged by Speranzeva to focus on modern dance instead of ballet, Dunham opened her first dance school in 1933, calling it the Negro Dance Group. It was a venue for Dunham to teach young black dancers about their African heritage.\n\nIn 1934\u20131936, Dunham performed as a guest artist with the ballet company of the Chicago Opera. Ruth Page had written a scenario and choreographed ''La Guiablesse'' (\"The Devil Woman\"), based on a Martinican folk tale in [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s ''Two Years in the French West Indies''. It opened in Chicago in 1933, with a black cast and with Page dancing the title role. The next year the production was repeated with Katherine Dunham in the lead and with students from Dunham's Negro Dance Group in the ensemble. Her dance career was interrupted by her travel to the Caribbean for anthropological research.\n\nHaving completed her undergraduate work at the University of Chicago and decided to pursue a performing career rather than academic studies, Dunham revived her dance ensemble. In 1937 she traveled with them to New York to take part in ''A Negro Dance Evening'', organized by [[Edna Guy]] at the 92nd Street YMHA. The troupe performed a suite of West Indian dances in the first half of the program and a ballet entitled ''Tropic Death'', with [[Talley Beatty]], in the second half. Upon returning to Chicago, the company performed at the [[Goodman Theater]] and at the Abraham Lincoln Center. Dunham created ''Rara Tonga'' and ''Woman with a Cigar'' at this time, which became well known. With choreography characterized by exotic sexuality, both became signature works in the Dunham repertory. After her company performed successfully, Dunham was chosen as dance director of the Chicago Negro Theater Unit of the [[Federal Theatre Project]]. In this post, she choreographed the Chicago production of ''Run Li'l Chil'lun'', performed at the Goodman Theater. She also created several other works of choreography, including ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' (a response to the play by [[Eugene O'Neill]]) and ''Barrelhouse''.\n\nAt this time Dunham first became associated with designer John Pratt, whom she later married. Together, they produced the first version of her dance composition ''L'Ag'Ya'', which premiered on January 27, 1938, as a part of the Federal Theater Project in Chicago. Based on her research in Martinique, this three-part performance integrated elements of a Martinique fighting dance into American ballet.\n\n===From 1939 to the late 1950s===\nIn 1939, Dunham's company gave additional performances in Chicago and Cincinnati and then returned to New York. Dunham had been invited to stage a new number for the popular, long-running musical revue ''Pins and Needles 1940'', produced by the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers Union]]. As this show continued its run at the Windsor Theater, Dunham booked her own company in the theater for a Sunday performance. This concert, billed as ''Tropics'' and ''Le Hot Jazz'', included not only her favorite partners [[Archie Savage]] and [[Talley Beatty]], but her principal Haitian drummer, [[Papa Augustin]]. Initially scheduled for a single performance, the show was so popular that the troupe repeated it for another ten Sundays.\n\nBased on this success, the entire company was engaged for the 1940 Broadway production ''[[Cabin in the Sky (musical)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', staged by [[George Balanchine]] and starring [[Ethel Waters]]. With Dunham in the sultry role of temptress Georgia Brown, the show ran for 20 weeks in New York. It next moved to the West Coast for an extended run of performances there. The show created a minor controversy in the press.<!-- Explain what it was -->\n\nAfter the national tour of ''Cabin in the Sky'', the Dunham company stayed in [[Los Angeles]], where they appeared in the [[Warner Brothers]] short film ''Carnival of Rhythm'' (1941). The next year, after the US entered World War II, Dunham appeared in the Paramount musical film ''Star Spangled Rhythm'' (1942) in a specialty number, \"Sharp as a Tack,\" with [[Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson]]. Other movies she performed in as a dancer during this period included the [[Abbott and Costello]] comedy ''[[Pardon My Sarong]]'' (1942) and the black musical ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'' (1943), which featured a stellar range of actors, musicians and dancers.<ref>Claude Conyers, \"Film Choreography by Katherine Dunham, 1939\u20131964,\" in Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), pp. 639\u201342.</ref>\n\nThe company returned to New York. In September 1943, under the management of the impresario [[Sol Hurok]], her troupe opened in ''Tropical Review'' at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theater]]. Featuring lively Latin American and Caribbean dances, plantation dances, and American social dances, the show was an immediate success. The original two-week engagement was extended by popular demand into a three-month run, after which the company embarked on an extensive tour of the United States and Canada. In Boston, then a bastion of conservatism, the show was banned in 1944 after only one performance. Although it was well received by the audience, local censors feared that the revealing costumes and provocative dances might compromise public morals. After the tour, in 1945, the Dunham company appeared in the short-lived ''Blue Holiday'' at the [[Belasco Theater]] in New York, and in the more successful ''Carib Song'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]]. The finale to the first act of this show was ''Shango'', a staged interpretation of a Vodun ritual, which became a permanent part of the company's repertory.\n\nIn 1946, Dunham returned to Broadway for a revue entitled ''Bal N\u00e8gre'', which received glowing notices from theater and dance critics. Early in 1947 Dunham choreographed the musical play ''Windy City'', which premiered at the Great Northern Theater in Chicago. Later in the year she opened a cabaret show in [[Las Vegas]], during the first year that the city became a popular entertainment as well as gambling destination. Later that year she took her troupe to Mexico, where their performances were so popular that they stayed and performed for more than two months. After Mexico, Dunham began touring in Europe, where she was an immediate sensation. In 1948, she opened ''A Caribbean Rhapsody'', first at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in London, and then took it to the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris.\n\nThis was the beginning of more than 20 years during which Dunham performed with her company almost exclusively outside the United States. During these years, the Dunham company appeared in some 33 countries in Europe, North Africa, South America, Australia, and East Asia. Dunham continued to develop dozens of new productions during this period, and the company met with enthusiastic audiences in every city. Despite these successes, the company frequently ran into periods of financial difficulties, as Dunham was required to support all of the 30 to 40 dancers and musicians.\n\nDunham and her company appeared in the Hollywood movie ''[[Casbah (film)|Casbah]]'' (1948) with [[Tony Martin (American singer)|Tony Martin]], [[Yvonne De Carlo]], and [[Peter Lorre]], and in the Italian film ''Botta e Risposta'', produced by Dino de Laurentiis. Also that year they appeared in the first ever, hour-long American spectacular televised by [[NBC]], when television was first beginning to spread across America. This was followed by television spectaculars filmed in London, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Sydney, and Mexico City.\n\nIn 1950, Sol Hurok presented Katherine Dunham and Her Company in a dance revue at the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theater]] in New York, with a program composed of some of Dunham's best works. It closed after only 38 performances. The company soon embarked on a tour of venues in South America, Europe, and North Africa. They had particular success in Denmark and France. In the mid-1950s, Dunham and her company appeared in three films: ''Mambo'' (1954), made in Italy; ''Die Grosse Starparade'' (1954), made in Germany; and ''M\u00fasica en la Noche'' (1955), made in Mexico City.\n\n===Later career===\nThe Dunham company's international tours ended in Vienna in 1960. They were stranded without money because of bad management by their impresario. Dunham saved the day by arranging for the company to be paid to appear in a German television special, ''Karibische Rhythmen'', after which they returned to the United States. Dunham's last appearance on Broadway was in 1962 in ''Bamboche!'', which included a few former Dunham dancers in the cast and a contingent of dancers and drummers from the Royal Troupe of Morocco. It was not a success, closing after only eight performances.\n\nA highlight of Dunham's later career was the invitation from New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]] to stage dances for a new production of ''[[Aida]]'', starring soprano [[Leontyne Price]]. In 1963, she became the first African American to choreograph for the Met since [[Hemsley Winfield]] set the dances for ''The Emperor Jones'' in 1933. The critics acknowledged the historical research she did on dance in ancient Egypt, but they were not appreciative of her choreography as staged for this production.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E1D91E3DE731A25753C2A9669D946291D6CF |title=Dunham's Dances and Verdi's 'Aida' |date=October 20, 1963 |accessdate=March 7, 2015 | author=Hughes, Allen |location=New York City, NY |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, Dunham undertook various choreographic commissions at several venues in the United States and in Europe. In 1967 she officially retired, after presenting a final show at the famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem, New York]]. Even in retirement Dunham continued to choreograph: one of her major works was directing the premiere full, posthumous production [[Scott Joplin]]'s opera ''[[Treemonisha]]'' in 1972, a joint production of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Morehouse College]] chorus in Atlanta, conducted by [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Southern, Eileen|title=The Music of Black Americans|publisher=W.

[[Alvin Ailey]] later produced a tribute for her in 1987\u201388 at [[Carnegie Hall]] with his [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater|American Dance Theater]], entitled ''The Magic of Katherine Dunham.''\n\n==Educator and writer==\n[[File:Katherine Dunham 1963.jpg|thumb|Katherine Dunham 1963]]\nIn 1945, Dunham opened and directed the '''Katherine Dunham School''' of Dance and Theatre near [[Times Square]] in New York City. Her dance company was provided with rent-free studio space for three years by an admirer and patron, [[Lee Shubert]]; it had an initial enrollment of 350 students.\n\nThe program included courses in dance, drama, performing arts, applied skills, humanities, cultural studies, and Caribbean research. In 1947 it was expanded and granted a charter as the Katherine Dunham School of Cultural Arts. The school was managed in Dunham's absence by [[Syvilla Fort]], one of her dancers, and thrived for about 10 years. It was considered one of the best learning centers of its type at the time. Schools inspired by it were later opened in Stockholm, Paris, and Rome by dancers who had been trained by Dunham.\n\nHer alumni included many future celebrities, such as [[Eartha Kitt]]. As a teenager, she won a scholarship to the Dunham school and later became a dancer with the company, before beginning her successful singing career. Dunham and Kitt collaborated again in the 1970s in an Equity Production of the musical ''Peg,'' based on the Irish play, ''Peg O' My Heart.'' Dunham Company member Dana McBroom-Manno was selected as a featured artist in the show, which played on the Music Fair Circuit.\n\nOthers who attended her school included [[James Dean]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Jose Ferrer]], [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Warren Beatty]]. [[Marlon Brando]] frequently dropped in to play the bongo drums, and jazz musician [[Charles Mingus]] held regular jam sessions with the drummers. Known for her many innovations, Dunham developed a dance pedagogy, later named the Dunham Technique, a style of movement and exercises based in traditional African dances, to support her choreography. This won international acclaim and is now taught as a modern dance style in many dance schools.\n\nBy 1957, Dunham was under severe personal strain, which was affecting her health. She decided to live for a year in relative isolation in [[Kyoto, Japan]], where she worked on writing memoirs of her youth. The first work, entitled ''A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood'', was published in 1959. A continuation based on her experiences in Haiti, ''Island Possessed'', was published in 1969. A fictional work based on her African experiences, ''Kasamance: A Fantasy'', was published in 1974. Throughout her career, Dunham occasionally published articles about her anthropological research (sometimes under the pseudonym of Kaye Dunn) and sometimes lectured on anthropological topics at universities and scholarly societies.<ref>See \"Selected Bibliography of Writings by Katherine Dunham\" in Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), pp. 643\u201346.</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Dunham was commissioned to choreograph ''Aida'' at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera Company]], with [[Leontyne Price]] in the title role. Members of Dunham's last New York Company auditioned to become members of the Met Ballet Company. Among her dancers selected were Marcia McBroom, Dana McBroom, Jean Kelly, and Jesse Oliver. The Met Ballet Company dancers studied Dunham Technique at Dunham's 42nd Street dance studio for the entire summer leading up to the season opening of ''Aida.'' [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was in the audience for opening night. Dunham's background as an anthropologist gave the dances of the opera a new authenticity. She was also consulted on costuming for the Egyptian and Ethiopian dress. Dana McBroom-Manno still teaches Dunham Technique in New York City and is a Master of Dunham Technique.\n\nIn 1964, Dunham settled in [[East St. Louis]], and took up the post of artist-in-residence at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|Southern Illinois University]] in nearby [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]]. There she was able to bring anthropologists, sociologists, educational specialists, scientists, writers, musicians, and theater people together to create a liberal arts curriculum that would be a foundation for further college work. One of her fellow professors, with whom she collaborated, was architect [[Buckminster Fuller]].\n\nThe following year, 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] nominated Dunham to be technical cultural adviser\u2014 a sort of cultural ambassador\u2014to the government of [[Senegal]] in West Africa. Her mission was to help train the Senegalese National Ballet and to assist President [[Leopold Senghor]] with arrangements for the [[World Festival of Negro Arts|First Pan-African World Festival of Negro Arts]] in [[Dakar]] (1965\u201366). Later Dunham  established a second home in Senegal, and she occasionally returned there to scout for talented African musicians and dancers.\n\nIn 1967, Dunham opened the [[Performing Arts Training Center]] (PATC) in [[East St. Louis]] in an effort to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. The restructuring of heavy industry had caused the loss of many working-class jobs, and unemployment was high in the city. After the 1968 riots following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King]], Dunham encouraged gang members in the ghetto to come to the Center to use drumming and dance to vent their frustrations. The PATC teaching staff was made up of former members of Dunham's touring company, as well as local residents. While trying to help the young people in the community, Dunham was arrested. This gained international headlines and the embarrassed local police officials quickly released her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students. She lectured every summer until her death at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis, which attracted dance students from around the world. She established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her personal collection.\n\nIn 1976, Dunham was guest artist-in-residence and lecturer for Afro-American studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. A photographic exhibit honoring her achievements, entitled ''Kaiso! Katherine Dunham,'' was mounted at the Women's Center on the campus. In 1978, an anthology of writings by and about her, also entitled ''Kaiso! Katherine Dunham'', was published in a limited, numbered edition of 130 copies by the Institute for the Study of Social Change.\n\n==Social activism==\nThe Katherine Dunham Company toured throughout North America in the mid-1940s, performing as well in the [[Racial segregation in the United States#In the South|racially segregated South]]. Dunham refused to hold a show in one theater after finding out that the city's black residents had not been allowed to buy tickets for the performance. On another occasion, in October 1944, after getting a rousing standing ovation in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], she told the all-white audience that she and her company would not return because \"your management will not allow people like you to sit next to people like us.\" She expressed a hope that time and the \"war for tolerance and democracy\" (this was during World War II) would bring a change.<ref>Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), p. 252.</ref> One historian noted that \"during the course of the tour, Dunham and the troupe had recurrent problems with racial discrimination, leading her to a posture of militancy which was to characterize her subsequent career.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn Hollywood, Dunham refused to sign a lucrative studio contract when the producer said she would have to replace some of her darker-skinned company members. She and her company frequently had difficulties finding adequate accommodations while on tour because in many regions of the country, black Americans were not allowed to stay at hotels.\n\nWhile Dunham was recognized as \"unofficially\" representing American cultural life in her foreign tours, she was given very little assistance of any kind by the U.S. State Department. She had incurred the displeasure of departmental officials when her company performed ''Southland'', a ballet that dramatized the lynching of a black man in the racist American South. Its premiere performance on December 9, 1950, at the Teatro Municipal in [[Santiago, Chile]],<ref>\"Hoy programa extraordinario y el s\u00e1bado dos estamos nos ofrece Katherine Dunham,\" ''El Mercurio'' (Santiago, Chile), Thursday, December 7, 1950.</ref><ref>Joanna Dee Das, [http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/dunham_essay_deedas.pdf \"Katherine Dunham (1909-2006)\"], Dance Heritage Coalition.</ref> generated considerable public interest in the early months of 1951.<ref>Constance Valis Hill, \"Katherine Dunham's ''Southland'': Protest in the Face of Repression,\" reprinted in Clark and Johnson, ''Kaiso!'' (2005), pp. 345\u201363.</ref> The State Department was dismayed by the negative view of American society that the ballet presented to foreign audiences. As a result, Dunham would later experience some diplomatic \"difficulties\" on her tours. The State Department regularly subsidized other less well-known groups, but it consistently refused to support her company (even when it was entertaining U.S. Army troops), although at the same time it did not hesitate to take credit for them as \"unofficial artistic and cultural representatives.\"\n\n===The Afonso Arinos Law in Brazil===\nIn 1950, while visiting [[Brazil]], Dunham and her group were refused rooms at a first-class hotel in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the Hotel Esplanada, frequented by many American businessmen. Understanding that the fact was due to racial discrimination, she made sure the incident was publicized. The incident was widely discussed in the Brazilian press and became a hot political issue. In response, the Afonso Arinos law was passed in 1951 that made racial discrimination in public places a felony in Brazil.<ref>Edward E.

Whitten Jr. (eds), ''Blackness in Latin American and Caribbean'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988), p. 117.</ref>\n\n===Hunger strike===\nIn 1992, at age 83, Dunham went on a highly publicized [[hunger strike]] to protest the discriminatory U.S. foreign policy against [[Haitian boat-people]].\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that, \"she went on a 47-day hunger strike to protest the U.S.'s forced repatriation of Haitian refugees. \"My job\", she said, \"is to create a useful legacy.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198884-2,00.html ''Time'' magazine article]</ref> During her protest, [[Dick Gregory]] led a non-stop vigil at her home, where many disparate personalities came to show their respect, such [[Debbie Allen]], [[Jonathan Demme]], and [[Louis Farrakhan]], leader of the [[Nation of Islam]].\n\nThis initiative drew international publicity to the plight of the Haitian boat-people and U.S. discrimination against them. Dunham ended her fast only after exiled Haitian president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] and [[Jesse Jackson]] came to her and personally requested that she stop risking her life for this cause.  In recognition of her stance, President Aristide later awarded her a medal of Haiti's highest honor.\n\n==Private life==\nDunham married Jordis McCoo, a black postal worker, in 1931, but he did not share her interests and they gradually drifted apart, finally divorcing in 1938. About that time Dunham met and began to work with John Thomas Pratt, a Canadian who had become one of America's most renowned costume and theatrical set designers. Pratt, who was white, shared Dunham's interests in African-Caribbean cultures and was happy to put his talents in her service. After he became her artistic collaborator, they became romantically involved. In the summer of 1941, after the national tour of ''Cabin in the Sky'' ended, they went to Mexico, where inter-racial marriages were less controversial than in the United States, and engaged in a commitment ceremony on 20 July, which thereafter they gave as the date of their wedding.<ref>Katherine Dunham, ''The Minefield'' (manuscript, c. 1980\u201385), book II, 122\u2013123, Box 20, Katherine Dunham Papers, Missouri History Museum Library and Research Center, St. Louis.</ref> In fact, that ceremony was not recognized as a legal marriage in the United States, a point of law that would come to trouble them some years later. Katherine Dunham and John Pratt married in 1949 to adopt Marie-Christine, a French 14-month-old baby. From the beginning of their association, around 1938, Pratt designed the sets and every costume Dunham ever wore. He continued as her artistic collaborator until his death in 1986.\n\nWhen she was not performing, Dunham and Pratt often visited Haiti for extended stays. On one of these visits, during the late 1940s, she purchased a large property of more than seven hectares (approximately 17.3 acres) in the Carrefours suburban area of Port-au-Prince, known as Habitation Leclerc. Dunham used Habitation Leclerc as a private retreat for many years, frequently bringing members of her dance company to recuperate from the stress of touring and to work on developing new dance productions. After running it as a tourist spot, with Vodun dancing as entertainment, in the early 1960s, she sold it to a French entrepreneur in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1949, Dunham returned from international touring with her company for a brief stay in the United States, where she suffered a temporary nervous breakdown after the premature death of her beloved brother Albert. He had been a promising philosophy professor at [[Howard University]] and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. During this time, she developed a warm friendship with the psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]], whom she had known in Europe. He was only one of a number of international celebrities who were Dunham's friends. In December 1951, a photo of Dunham dancing with [[Ismaili Muslim]] leader [[Prince Ali Khan]] at a private party he had hosted for her in Paris appeared in a popular magazine and fueled rumors that the two were romantically linked.<ref>''Jet: The Weekly Negro News Magazine'', vol. 1, no. 9 (December 27, 1951).</ref> Both Dunham and the prince denied the suggestion. The prince was then married to actress [[Rita Hayworth]], and Dunham was now legally married to John Pratt; a quiet ceremony in Las Vegas had taken place earlier in the year.<ref>Katherine Dunham, ''The Minefield'' (manuscript, c. 1980-85).</ref> The couple had officially adopted their foster daughter, a 14-month-old girl they had found as an infant in a Roman Catholic convent nursery in Fresnes, France. Named Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, she was their only child.\n\nAmong Dunham's closest friends and colleagues was Julie Robinson, formerly a performer with the Katherine Dunham Company, and her husband, singer and later political activist [[Harry Belafonte]]. Both remained close friends of Dunham for many years, until her death. [[Glory Van Scott]] and [[Jean-L\u00e9on Destin\u00e9]] were among other former Dunham dancers who remained her lifelong friends.<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, \"Katherine Dunham's Legacy, Visible in Youth and Age,\" ''New York Times'' (March 3, 2003).</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn May 21, 2006, Dunham died in her sleep from [[natural causes]] in [[New York City]]. She died a month before her 97th birthday. She wished her family a happy life.\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Katherine Dunham, Dance Icon, Dies at 96|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/arts/dance/23dunham.html|accessdate=September 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Anna Kisselgoff]], a dance critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called Dunham \"a major pioneer in Black theatrical dance ... ahead of her time.\" \"In introducing authentic African dance-movements to her company and audiences, Dunham\u2014perhaps more than any other choreographer of the time\u2014exploded the possibilities of modern dance expression.\"\n\nAs one of her biographers, Joyce Aschenbrenner, wrote: \"Today, it is safe to say, there is no American black dancer who has not been influenced by the Dunham Technique, unless he or she works entirely within a classical genre\", and the Dunham Technique is still taught to anyone who studies modern dance.\n\nThe highly respected ''Dance'' magazine did a feature cover story on Dunham in August 2000 entitled \"One-Woman Revolution.\"  As [[Wendy Perron]] wrote, \"Jazz dance, 'fusion,' and the search for our cultural identity all have their antecedents in Dunham's work as a dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist. She was the first American dancer to present indigenous forms on a concert stage, the first to sustain a black dance company.... She created and performed in works for stage, clubs, and Hollywood films; she started a school and a technique that continue to flourish; she fought unstintingly for racial justice.\"\n\nScholar of the arts [[Harold Cruse]] wrote in 1964: \"Her early and lifelong search for meaning and artistic values for black people, as well as for all peoples, has motivated, created opportunities for, and launched careers for generations of young black artists ... Afro-American dance was usually in the avant-garde of modern dance ... Dunham's entire career spans the period of the emergence of Afro-American dance as a serious art.\"\n\nBlack writer, Arthur Todd, described her as \"one of our national treasures.\" Regarding her impact and effect he wrote: \"The rise of American Negro dance commenced ... when Katherine Dunham and her company skyrocketed into the Windsor Theater in New York, from Chicago in 1940, and made an indelible stamp on the dance world... Miss Dunham opened the doors that made possible the rapid upswing of this dance for the present generation.\" \"What Dunham gave modern dance was a coherent lexicon of African and Caribbean styles of movement\u2014a flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis and isolation of the limbs, a polyrhythmic strategy of moving\u2014which she integrated with techniques of ballet and modern dance.\" \"Her mastery of body movement was considered 'phenomenal.' She was hailed for her smooth and fluent choreography and dominated a stage with what has been described as 'an unmitigating radiant force providing beauty with a feminine touch full of variety and nuance.\"\n\nRichard Buckle, ballet historian and critic, wrote: \"Her company of magnificent dancers and musicians ... met with the success it has and that herself as explorer, thinker, inventor, organizer, and dancer should have reached a place in the estimation of the world, has done more than a million pamphlets could for the service of her people.\"\n\n\"Dunham's European success led to considerable imitation of her work in European revues ... it is safe to say that the perspectives of concert-theatrical dance in Europe were profoundly affected by the performances of the Dunham troupe.\"\n\nWhile in Europe, she also influenced hat styles on the continent as well as spring fashion collections, featuring the Dunham line and Caribbean Rhapsody, and the Chiroteque Fran\u00e7aise made a bronze cast of her feet for a museum of important personalities.\"\n\nThe Katherine Dunham Company became an incubator for many well known performers, including Archie Savage, [[Talley Beatty]], Janet Collins, Lenwood Morris, Vanoye Aikens, Lucille Ellis, Pearl Reynolds, [[Camille Yarbrough]], [[Lavinia Williams]], and Tommy Gomez.\n\n[[Alvin Ailey]], who stated that he first became interested in dance as a professional career after having seen a performance of the Katherine Dunham Company as a young teenager of 14 in Los Angeles, called the Dunham Technique \"the closest thing to a unified Afro-American dance existing.\"\n\nFor several years, Dunham's personal assistant and press promoter was [[Maya Deren]], who later also became interested in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodun]] and wrote ''The Divine Horseman: The Voodoo Gods of Haiti'' (1953). Deren is now considered to be a pioneer of independent American filmmaking. Dunham herself was quietly involved in both the Voodoo and [[Orisa]] communities of the Caribbean and the United States, in particular with the [[Lucumi religion|Lucumi]] tradition.\n\nNot only did Dunham shed light on the cultural value of black dance, but she clearly contributed to changing perceptions of blacks in America by showing society that as a black woman, she could be an intelligent scholar, a beautiful dancer, and a skilled choreographer. As Julia Foulkes pointed out, \"Dunham's path to success lay in making high art in the United States from African and Caribbean sources, capitalizing on a heritage of dance within the African Diaspora, and raising perceptions of African American capabilities.\"<ref>Julia L. Foulkes, ''Modern Bodies: Dance and American Modernism from Martha Graham to Alvin Ailey'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 72.</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nOver the years Katherine Dunham has received scores of special awards, including more than a dozen honorary doctorates from various American universities.\n* In 1971 she received the Heritage Award from the [[National dance association|National Dance Association]].\n* In 1979 at [[Carnegie Hall]], she received the Albert Schweitzer Music Award \"for a life's work dedicated to music and devoted to humanity.\"\n* In 1983 she was a recipient of one of the highest artistic awards in the United States, the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].\n* In 1986 the American Anthropological Association gave her a Distinguished Service Award.\n* In 1987 she received the Samuel H.

At first he kept to himself but after befriending Woodie, he begins to break out of his shell. He starts taking up surfing and develops a crush on Jeena who finally became his girlfriend. Mondo has never met his father; in \"Mondo Mia!\" we learn that his father was a \"cleanup man\" for the Mob who had to go on the run after witnessing something he shouldn't (two mobsters making out). He is Jeena's boyfriend.\n* Woodford \"Woodie\" Stone ([[Adam Brody]]): Woodie is Mondo's best friend. As opposed to Mondo who is short and fat, Woodie is tall and skinny. Woodie is a lazy, laid-back and hedonistic surfer. He hates doing any type of work and prefers to spend all of his days surfing. Woodie's family is incredibly rich, but he hates what material wealth has done to them and prefers to sleep in a bamboo hut outside the mansion.\n* Barbara \"Babs\" Brando ([[Debi Mazar]]): Babs is Mondo's mother, she has worked several jobs: her current job is waitressing at a Hawaiian restaurant. She is very attractive and has large breasts and is the object of Woodie's (and every other man's) desire. A running gag in the pilot was that she longed for a job where she didn't have to work a pole, be on her back, be on her knees, and so on, and then several jobs where she did these things were seen: fireman-pole cleaner, meter maid, factory worker, mechanic, etc.\n* Winthrop Aguilera Wadska ([[Tony Hale]]): Commonly referred to by his last name, Wadska is hyperactive, overly paranoid and somewhat psychotic. Wadska is known to engage in harmful and dangerous behavior and often gets Woodie and Mondo involved in some way. According to his sister Jeena he is on medication, possibly the reason behind his behavior. He also uses the Internet to prepare for both the apocalypse and college, whatever comes first to him. In every episode, his shirt has a different saying on it; similar to Frank's hats on ''[[30 Rock]]''.\n* Jeena Wadska ([[Olivia Thirlby]]): Jeena is a popular and attractive girl who is Mondo's crush after having a vision about their graduation, marriage, life, afterlife in Episode 1. She is a bit of a tomboy and is very nice and laid-back. She also likes Mondo but she has an on-and-off relationship with Turk; in \"Red Tuxedo\" she breaks up with Turk and begins dating Mondo. She is Wadska's sister and Mondo's girlfriend.\n* Dirk Kirk \"Turk\" Turkpatrick ([[Jake Busey]]): Turk is the resident tough guy. He is shown as a brash and unrefined bully often targets Mondo. However he has a very sensitive side and shown to be rather cowardly deep down. He used to date Milan and now has an on-and-off relationship with Jeena who later breaks up with him and starts dating Mondo.\n* Milan Stone ([[Kari Wahlgren]]): Milan is Woodie's sister. She is a mean, vapid, vain, pretentious, snobbish, selfish, promiscuous and spoiled celebrity heiress who stars in her own reality show on [[MTV]] titled \"16 and Bitchy\". She has breast implants (which are removable by zipper) and used to date Turk. Despite her spoiled and snobbish demeanor, it is revealed that prior to her family's wealthy lifestyle, she and her brother always played together at the beach when they were young kids and that she still secretly cherishes that.\n* Voneeta Teets ([[Danny McBride]]): The sex-ed teacher at Del Toro High. She is a bisexual who weighs 400 pounds and gets around in a motorized scooter, but she is immensely proud of her body and is insatiably horny.\n* Lonnie ([[Alan Tudyk]]): A hippie and [[Gulf War]] vet who lives in a van by the beach. He gives Mondo and Woodie advice, usually while stoned.\n* HJ & BJ Kuntz ([[Cree Summer]]): Identical twins who are Milan's friends/entourage.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=#60e6ff\n|overall= \n|title=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode = \n|country=US\n|viewers=\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Pilot\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|10|27}}\n| Viewers = 1.598\n| ProdCode = GV101\n| ShortSummary = Jersey boy Mondo moves to a laid-back Southern California beach town in the premiere of this animated comedy.
