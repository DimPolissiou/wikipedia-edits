The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria. Tisza supported the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and was representative of the then ''liberal-conservative consent''.\n[[File:Istvan Tisza. Oxford, United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in Oxford, England]]\n[[File:Tisza Istv\u00e1n 1904.jpg|thumb|right|The 33-year-old Tisza as a member of the parliament in 1894]]\n[[File:Tisza with his family.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza and his family.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\nHe was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister.\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the Upper House of Parliament (similar to House of Lords in Britain), staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants  - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and anddecided to organize a protest march. Socialist agents organised a worker rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, meanwhile the events transformed to violence, protesters broke the shop windows in the surrounding streets, automobiles and tramcard were damaged by the masses.  However the protesters were stopped by the storm of hussar cavalry units, and they were arrested by the police. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as \"Blood-Red Thursday\" in the contemporary press and later in the history books.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria. Tisza supported the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and was representative of the then ''liberal-conservative consent''.\n[[File:Istvan Tisza.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\nHe was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister.\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the House of Parliament, staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants  - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and anddecided to organize a protest march. Socialist agents organised a worker rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, meanwhile the events transformed to violence, protesters broke the shop windows in the surrounding streets, automobiles and tramcard were damaged by the masses.  However the protesters were stopped by the storm of hussar cavalry units, and they were arrested by the police. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as \"Blood-Red Thursday\" in the contemporary press and later in the history books.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

The episode originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on January 19, 2012. It was written by Owen Ellickson and was directed by [[Charles McDougall]]. The episode guest starred [[Lindsey Broad]] and [[Eleanor Seigler]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. There, [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) tries to make [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of his massive home.\n\n\"Pool Party\" received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the episode's lack of a finite plot. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], \"Pool Party\" drew 6.02 million viewers and received a 3 rating/7% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, marking a slight increase from the previous episode, \"[[Trivia (The Office)|Trivia]]\". The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and was the highest rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) is forced to sell his mansion at the behest of his ex-wife following his divorce, [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) takes his girlfriend Jessica ([[Eleanor Seigler]]) to the party and brings an engagement ring his Jessica-approving mother gave him, hoping to propose. The ring goes missing from Andy's pants and he is horrified that he cannot find it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) and [[Phyllis Vance]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) later find the ring and decide, based on the superstition of finding a lost ring, that it must be destroyed, setting it in the pool atop a tiny pyre. [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]), having been told by [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) that Andy followed her home after the [[Christmas Wishes (The Office)|Christmas party]], decides to make Andy jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Dwight initially refuses, but, after realizing that Erin's choosing him as her co-conspirator is flattering to his attractiveness, agrees to help. The two flirt outrageously whenever Andy is close by, but Andy does not notice. To ensure Andy's attention, Erin and Dwight challenge Andy and Jessica to a series of [[chicken fight]]s in the pool. After several defeats, Erin is so determined to win a match that she pushes Dwight to the point where he passes out in the water, ending the game. In a final attempt to make Andy jealous, Dwight tells Andy he wants to pursue a romance with Erin but wants to avoid an \"Angela-type situation\" between them. Andy assures Dwight that he and Erin are through but, at the mention of Dwight having sex with Erin that very night, suggests that Dwight take things slowly instead, leading Dwight to pointedly tell him \"You're an idiot.\" Erin later swims up to Andy with the lost ring, and he admits that he has doubts about proposing to Jessica. This makes Erin very happy.\n\nWhile most of the employees are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the guys a tour of his massive home, spending most of the time mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild [[Bacchanalia#Modern_usage|Bacchanalia]]s. Ruing that his wine cellar will only \"go to the lawyers\" if left undrunk, he opens it to those at the party, who proceed to get drunk with him. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay for the duration of the tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by [[Gabe Lewis]] ([[Zach Woods]]) and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their [[Sycophancy|brown-nosing]] battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by co-producer Owen Ellickson, his first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season.<ref name=\"poolep\">{{Cite episode | title = Pool Party | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = January 12, 2012 | season = 8 | number = 12}}</ref> It was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], his seventh directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"poolep\"/> The episode also marks the sixth appearance of [[Lindsey Broad]], who plays [[Cathy Simms|Cathy]], Pam's replacement during her [[maternity leave]].<ref name=\"castingbroad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/the-office-lindsey-broad/ |title=The Office Exclusive: 'Til Death's Lindsey Broad Befriends Pam |author=Ausiello, Michael |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Due to [[Jenna Fischer]]'s actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode.<ref name=\"maternity\">{{cite web|last=Hochberg |first=Mina |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |title=The Office's Jenna Fischer Confirms That Baby No. 2 Is On the Way for Pam and Jim \u2013 Vulture |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=August 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101095327/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}</ref> The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.

The episode originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on January 19, 2012. It was written by Owen Ellickson and was directed by [[Charles McDougall]]. The episode guest starred [[Lindsey Broad]] and [[Eleanor Seigler]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. There, [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) tries to make [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of his massive home.\n\n\"Pool Party\" received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the episode's lack of a finite plot. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], \"Pool Party\" drew 6.02 million viewers and received a 3 rating/7% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, marking a slight increase from the previous episode, \"[[Trivia (The Office)|Trivia]]\". The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and was the highest rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) is forced to sell his mansion at the behest of his ex-wife following his divorce, [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) takes his girlfriend Jessica ([[Eleanor Seigler]]) to the party and brings an engagement ring his Jessica-approving mother gave him, hoping to propose. The ring goes missing from Andy's pants and he is horrified that he cannot find it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) and [[Phyllis Vance]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) later find the ring and decide, based on the superstition of finding a lost ring, that it must be destroyed, setting it in the pool atop a tiny pyre. [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]), having been told by [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) that Andy followed her home after the [[Christmas Wishes (The Office)|Christmas party]], decides to make Andy jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Dwight initially refuses, but, after realizing that Erin's choosing him as her co-conspirator is flattering to his attractiveness, agrees to help. The two flirt outrageously whenever Andy is close by, but Andy does not notice. To ensure Andy's attention, Erin and Dwight challenge Andy and Jessica to a series of [[chicken fight]]s in the pool. After several defeats, Erin is so determined to win a match that she pushes Dwight to the point where he passes out in the water, ending the game. In a final attempt to make Andy jealous, Dwight tells Andy he wants to pursue a romance with Erin but wants to avoid an \"Angela-type situation\" between them. Andy assures Dwight that he and Erin are through but, at the mention of Dwight having sex with Erin that very night, suggests that Dwight take things slowly instead, leading Dwight to pointedly tell him \"You're an idiot.\" Erin later swims up to Andy with the lost ring, and he admits that he has doubts about proposing to Jessica. This makes Erin very happy.\n\nWhile most of the employees are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the guys a tour of his massive home, spending most of the time mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild [[Bacchanalia#Modern_usage|Bacchanalia]]s. Ruing his wine cellar will only \"go to the lawyers\" if left undrunk, he obligingly opens it to those along, who proceed to get drunk with him. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay for the duration of the tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by [[Gabe Lewis]] ([[Zach Woods]]) and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their [[Sycophancy|brown-nosing]] battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by co-producer Owen Ellickson, his first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season.<ref name=\"poolep\">{{Cite episode | title = Pool Party | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = January 12, 2012 | season = 8 | number = 12}}</ref> It was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], his seventh directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"poolep\"/> The episode also marks the sixth appearance of [[Lindsey Broad]], who plays [[Cathy Simms|Cathy]], Pam's replacement during her [[maternity leave]].<ref name=\"castingbroad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/the-office-lindsey-broad/ |title=The Office Exclusive: 'Til Death's Lindsey Broad Befriends Pam |author=Ausiello, Michael |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Due to [[Jenna Fischer]]'s actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode.<ref name=\"maternity\">{{cite web|last=Hochberg |first=Mina |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |title=The Office's Jenna Fischer Confirms That Baby No. 2 Is On the Way for Pam and Jim \u2013 Vulture |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=August 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101095327/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}</ref> The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.

Van den Berg was educated in the Netherlands where he attended the [[Delft University of Technology]] from 1949 to 1961 and earned his [[Engineer's degree]] in [[chemical engineering]].<ref name=\"delft-integraal\" /> He then moved to the United States to continue studying at the [[University of Delaware]], where he obtained a [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in [[applied science]], followed by a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1974, also in applied science.<ref name=\"nasa-bio\" />\n\n[[Image:Crystal in VCGS furnace.jpg|thumb|A crystal in the VCGS furnace]]\nAfter he had completed his doctoral study, he was offered a job at [[EG&G Corporation]] Energy Measurements in [[Goleta, California]], to work on crystal growth. EG&G was a [[defense contractor]] of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required Van den Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. Van den Berg gathered years of research and management experience in the preparation of [[crystalline]] materials\u2014in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on [[Mercury(II) iodide|mercuric iodide]] crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as [[gamma ray]] detectors. During his work at [[EG&G]], Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space, which NASA approved.<ref name=\"nasa-bio\" />\n\n==Spaceflight==\n===Selection===\n[[Image:Vapor Crystal Growth System Furnace.jpg|thumb|The Vapor Crystal Growth System Furnace experiment of STS-51-B.]]\n[[Image:STS51B-06-010.jpg|thumb|Lodewijk van den Berg observes the crystal growth aboard Spacelab.]]\nVan den Berg and his colleagues designed the EG&G Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided that it would be easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG&G and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a [[Payload Specialist]]. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.<ref name=\"delft-integraal\" /><ref name=\"netwerk\">{{cite video |title=De `vergeten astronaut` |url=http://www.netwerk.tv/node/3884 |medium=documentary |publisher=[[Netwerk]], [[NCRV]] and [[Evangelische Omroep|EO]] |accessdate=2008-04-09 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe first selection round, consisted of a selection based on science qualifications in the field in question, which Van den Berg easily passed. The final four candidates were tested on physical and mental qualifications which he also passed, while two of the others failed due to possible heart issues. He was now part of the final two, and NASA always trains two astronauts, a prime and a back-up. In 1983 he started to train as an astronaut and six months before the launch he was told that he would be the prime astronaut, much to his own surprise. When he went into space he was 53 years old, making him one of the oldest [[rookie]] astronauts.<ref name=\"delft-integraal\" /><ref name=\"netwerk\" />\n\n===STS-51B===\nVan den Berg was assigned as [[Payload Specialist]] on [[STS-51B]] ''Challenger'' (April 29\u2013May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], and returned to land at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]].

Van den Berg was educated in the Netherlands where he attended the [[Delft University of Technology]] from 1949 to 1961 and earned his [[Engineer's degree]] in [[chemical engineering]].<ref name=\"delft-integraal\" /> He then moved to the United States to continue studying at the [[University of Delaware]], where he obtained a [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in [[applied science]], followed by a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1974, also in applied science.<ref name=\"nasa-bio\" />\n\n[[Image:Crystal in VCGS furnace.jpg|thumb|A crystal in the VCGS furnace]]\nAfter he had completed his doctoral study, he was offered a job at [[EG&G Corporation]] Energy Measurements in [[Goleta, California]], to work on crystal growth. EG&G was a [[defense contractor]] of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required Van den Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. Van den Berg gathered years of research and management experience in the preparation of [[crystalline]] materials\u2014in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on [[Mercury(II) iodide|mercuric iodide]] crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as [[gamma ray]] detectors. During his work at [[EG&G]], Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space, which NASA approved.<ref name=\"nasa-bio\" />\n\n==Spaceflight==\n===Selection===\n[[Image:Vapor Crystal Growth System Furnace.jpg|thumb|The Vapor Crystal Growth System Furnace experiment of STS-51-B.]]\n[[Image:STS51B-06-010.jpg|thumb|Lodewijk van den Berg observes the crystal growth aboard Spacelab.]]\nVan den Berg and his colleagues designed the EG&G Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided that it would be easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG&G and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a [[Payload Specialist]]. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.<ref name=\"delft-integraal\" /><ref name=\"netwerk\">{{cite video |title=De `vergeten astronaut` |url=http://www.netwerk.tv/node/3884 |medium=documentary |publisher=[[Netwerk]], [[NCRV]] and [[Evangelische Omroep|EO]] |accessdate=2008-04-09 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe first selection round, consisted of a selection based on science qualifications in the field in question, which Van den Berg easily passed. The final four candidates were tested on physical and mental qualifications which he also passed, while two of the others failed due to possible heart issues. He was now part of the final two, and NASA always trains two astronauts, a prime and a back-up. In 1983 he started to train as an astronaut and six months before the launch he was told that he would be the prime astronaut, much to his own surprise. When he went into space he was 53 years old, making him one of the oldest [[rookie]] astronauts.<ref name=\"delft-integraal\" /><ref name=\"netwerk\" />\n\n===STS-51B===\nVan den Berg was assigned as [[Payload Specialist]] on [[STS-51B]] ''Challenger'' (April 29\u2013May 6, 1985).

Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the notoriously reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, <blockquote>\nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.<ref name=\"HRC award speech transcript\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|title=Lana Wachowski's HRC Visibility Award Acceptance Speech (Transcript)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026232657/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|archivedate=October 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\nIn February 2014, Lana received the Freedom Award from [[Equality Illinois]] at their annual gala in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/|title=EQIL Honors Chicago Filmmaker Lana Wachowski|work=equalityillinois.us|publisher=Equality Illinois|accessdate=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626110854/http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/|archivedate=June 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Equality Illinois to honor Chicago filmmaker Lana Wachowski |url=http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729 |publisher=GoPride.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125639/http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"EQIL Award Speech\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q|title=Equality Illinois 2014 Gala&nbsp;\u2013 Lana Wachowski Accepts Freedom Award|date=February 21, 2014|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608035432/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q|archivedate=June 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Lilly's gender transition ===\nIn March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to the ''Windy City Times'' after a visit from a reporter from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper, who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.<ref name=hr20160308 /><ref name=\"var20160308\" /><ref name=\"glaad20160308\" /><ref name=windycitytimes>{{cite news| url =http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html|title= Second Wachowski filmmaker sibling comes out as trans |first=Tracy |last=Baim| work=[[Windy City Times]]| date=March 8, 2016|accessdate=March 9, 2016| archivedate= March 9, 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160309093348/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/09/matrix-director-lilly-wachowski-comes-out-as-a-transgender-woman|title=Film director Lilly Wachowski comes out as transgender woman|last=Davies|first=Caroline|last2=Sweney|first2=Mark|date=2016-03-09|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> In that article, she said, \"I am one of the lucky ones.

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\n\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name=\"IGN\" />}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"3\" | Functioned as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the notoriously reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, <blockquote>\nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others.

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\n\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name=\"IGN\" />}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"3\" | Functioned as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

The two are called upon to sing a duet together for [[karaoke]] (\"Start of Something New\"). Returning to school after break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom. She explains that she has just moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and transferred to East High School over the break. As Troy shows Gabriella around the school, Drama Club President and East High's designated \"Ice Princess\" [[Sharpay Evans]] ([[Ashley Tisdale]]) assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning for the school musical, Twinkle Town. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay has Scholastic Decathlon Captain and Chem Club president [[Taylor McKessie]] ([[Monique Coleman]]) investigate Gabriella's past academic achievements to recruit Gabriella for the Scholastic Decathlon. As a result, Taylor and Gabriella became friends over their shared interests.\n\nDuring basketball practice, Troy is distracted by thoughts of Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother [[List of High School Musical characters#Ryan Evans|Ryan Evans]] ([[Lucas Grabeel]]) perform (\"What I've Been Looking For\"). However, Troy and Gabriella are too shy to audition. When Gabriella gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are unofficially declared \"over\", Troy offers to sing with her. However, drama teacher Ms. Darbus ([[Alyson Reed]]) tells them they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen ([[Olesya Rulin]]), the musical's [[composer]], trips and drops her music all over the stage. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her and sing together as Kelsi plays on the piano (\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\"). Overhearing their performance, Ms. Darbus gives them a [[Audition|callback audition]].\n\nWhen the callback list gets posted, Sharpay discovers that she has competition for the lead role, while the Wildcats basketball team is shocked that Troy has auditioned. After finding out that Troy can do activities outside his clique, other students confess their secret passions and talents (\"Stick to the Status Quo\"). This alarms Taylor and Troy's best friend [[Chad Danforth]] ([[Corbin Bleu]]). Taylor and Chad come up with a plan to divert Troy and Gabriella from singing in the musical so they can focus on their upcoming competitions. \n\nIn the locker room, Troy is tricked by his teammates into saying that Gabriella is not needed. Gabriella watches this via a hidden webcam that the scholastic decathlon team has set up. Upset by Troy's betrayal (\"When There Was Me and You\"), Gabriella decides to not audition for the musical. Troy, confused by Gabriella's decision, is unable to concentrate on the game, while Gabriella is low in spirits. Realizing their mistake, Chad and the basketball team tell Troy what happened and offer to support him in the callbacks. Troy goes to Gabriella's house, and they reconcile, determined to audition for the musical.\n\nOverhearing Gabriella and Troy rehearse, Sharpay asks Ms. Darbus to move the callbacks so they start at the same time as both Troy's basketball championship game and Gabriella's scholastic decathlon competition. Kelsi overhears the conversation, and the basketball and decathlon teams make a plan together. On the day of the competitions, Taylor and Gabriella use the school's computers to delay the championship game by hacking the power in the gym and causing a chemical reaction that forces an evacuation during the decathlon. Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium as Sharpay and Ryan finish their callback song (\"Bop to the Top\"). After Gabriella and Troy successfully perform their song (\"Breaking Free\"), Ms. Darbus gives them the lead roles, making Sharpay and Ryan [[Understudy|understudies]].\n\nBoth teams win their respective competitions, and the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (\"We're All In This Together\"). Chad asks Taylor out, and Sharpay makes peace with Gabriella.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Zeke Baylor ([[Chris Warren Jr.]]) paces alone in the gym, when Sharpay runs in, declaring that the cookies he had given her that she had initially rejected are \"genius.\" She hugs him, and he says he will make her a [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]. Zeke smiles in victory.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of High School Musical characters}}\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Troy Bolton, Gabriella's boyfriend, the most popular male student at East High School, and the captain of the [[varsity team|varsity]] [[basketball]] team.

The two are called upon to sing a duet together for [[karaoke]] (\"Start of Something New\"). Returning to school after break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom. She explains that she has just moved to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and transferred to East High School over the break. As Troy shows Gabriella around the school, Drama Club President and East High's designated \"Ice Princess\" [[Sharpay Evans]] ([[Ashley Tisdale]]) assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning for the school musical, Twinkle Town. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay has Scholastic Decathlon Captain and Chem Club president [[Taylor McKessie]] ([[Monique Coleman]]) investigate Gabriella's past academic achievements to recruit Gabriella for the Scholastic Decathlon. As a result, Taylor and Gabriella became friends over their shared interests.\n\nDuring basketball practice, Troy is distracted by thoughts of Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to basketball (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother [[List of High School Musical characters#Ryan Evans|Ryan Evans]] ([[Lucas Grabeel]]) perform (\"What I've Been Looking For\"). However, Troy and Gabriella are too shy to audition. When Gabriella gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are unofficially declared \"over\", Troy offers to sing with her. However, drama teacher Ms. Darbus ([[Alyson Reed]]) tells them they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen ([[Olesya Rulin]]), the musical's [[composer]], trips and drops her music all over the stage. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her and sing together as Kelsi plays on the piano (\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\"). Overhearing their performance, Ms. Darbus gives them a [[Audition|callback audition]].\n\nWhen the callback list gets posted, Sharpay discovers that she has competition for the lead role, while the Wildcats basketball team is shocked that Troy has auditioned. After finding out that Troy can do activities outside his clique, other students confess their secret passions and talents (\"Stick to the Status Quo\"). This alarms Taylor and Troy's best friend [[Chad Danforth]] ([[Corbin Bleu]]). Taylor and Chad come up with a plan to divert Troy and Gabriella from singing in the musical so they can focus on their upcoming competitions. \n\nIn the locker room, Troy is tricked by his teammates into saying that Gabriella is not needed. Gabriella watches this via a hidden webcam that the scholastic decathlon team has set up. Upset by Troy's betrayal (\"When There Was Me and You\"), Gabriella decides to not audition for the musical. Troy, confused by Gabriella's decision, is unable to concentrate on the game, while Gabriella is low in spirits. Realizing their mistake, Chad and the basketball team tell Troy what happened and offer to support him in the callbacks. Troy goes to Gabriella's house, and they reconcile, determined to audition for the musical.\n\nOverhearing Gabriella and Troy rehearse, Sharpay asks Ms. Darbus to move the callbacks so they start at the same time as both Troy's basketball championship game and Gabriella's scholastic decathlon competition. Kelsi overhears the conversation, and the basketball and decathlon teams make a plan together. On the day of the competitions, Taylor and Gabriella use the school's computers to delay the championship game by hacking the power in the gym and causing a chemical reaction that forces an evacuation during the decathlon. Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium as Sharpay and Ryan finish their callback song (\"Bop to the Top\"). After Gabriella and Troy successfully perform their song (\"Breaking Free\"), Ms. Darbus gives them the lead roles, making Sharpay and Ryan [[Understudy|understudies]].\n\nBoth teams win their respective competitions, and the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (\"We're All In This Together\"). Chad asks Taylor out, and Sharpay makes peace with Gabriella.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Zeke Baylor ([[Chris Warren Jr.]]) paces alone in the gym, when Sharpay runs in, declaring that the cookies he had given her that she had initially rejected are \"genius.\" She hugs him, and he says he will make her a [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]. Zeke smiles in victory.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of High School Musical characters}}\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Troy Bolton, Gabriella's boyfriend, the most popular male student at East High School, and the captain of the [[varsity team|varsity]] [[basketball]] team.
