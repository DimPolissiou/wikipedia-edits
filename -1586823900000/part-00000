An extra axial straw is added which doesn't exist in the simple polyhedron]]\nAn ''n''-gonal '''bipyramid''' or '''dipyramid''' is a [[polyhedron]] formed by joining an ''n''-gonal [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] and its [[mirror image]] base-to-base. An ''n''-gonal bipyramid has 2''n'' [[triangle]] faces, 3''n'' edges, and 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' vertices.\n\nThe referenced ''n''-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.\n\n==Right, oblique and concave bipyramids==\nA '''right bipyramid''' has two points above and below the [[centroid]] of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called '''oblique bipyramids'''. A '''regular bipyramid''' has a [[regular polygon]] internal face and is usually implied to be a ''right bipyramid''. A right bipyramid can be represented as {{nowrap|{ } + P}} for internal polygon P, and a regular ''n''-bipyramid {{nowrap|{ } + {''n''}.}}\n\nA '''concave bipyramid''' has a concave interior polygon.\n:[[File:Concave quadrilateral bipyramid.png|160px|A concave bipyramid]]\n\nThe [[face-transitive]] regular bipyramids are the [[dual polyhedra]] of the [[Prism (geometry)|uniform prisms]] and will generally have [[isosceles triangle]] faces.\n\nA bipyramid can be [[Perspective projection|projected]] on a sphere or [[globe]] as ''n'' equally spaced lines of [[longitude]] going from [[Geographical pole|pole]] to pole, and [[Bisection|bisected]] by a line around the [[equator]].\n\nBipyramid [[face (geometry)|face]]s, projected as [[spherical triangle]]s, represent the fundamental domains in the [[List of spherical symmetry groups#Dihedral|dihedral symmetry]] D<sub>''n''h</sub>.

An ''n''-gonal bipyramid has 2''n'' [[triangle]] faces, 3''n'' edges, and 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' vertices.\n\nThe referenced ''n''-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.\n\n==Right, oblique and concave bipyramids==\nA '''right bipyramid''' has two points above and below the [[centroid]] of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called '''oblique bipyramids'''. A '''regular bipyramid''' has a [[regular polygon]] internal face and is usually implied to be a ''right bipyramid''.

Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).  In addition to the classic and Best-Picture-Academy-Award winning ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]], her notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), with [[Gregory Peck]], and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), opposite [[Cary Grant]].\n\nIn 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed.  She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), the debut film for Yul Brynner, winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1958, she starred for a second time with Cary Grant, this time in the popular romantic comedy ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]''.\n\nIn her later years, she won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation) in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late-Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. She died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.<ref name=James>{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}</ref> In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O.

Her father, who was an artist and photographer, died when she was 13. In the years before he died, he wanted her to become an opera star, and had her take voice lessons for three years. But she always \"knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress\", sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|upright|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934), at age 19]]\nAfter her father's death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who died of heart disease only six months later. She then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. Ingrid would also visit with another aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called \"Mutti,\" according to family legend.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}\n\nLater, Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1935), although she reportedly had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[Intermezzo]]'' (1936) which is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her, and ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]]'', which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).\n\n==Hollywood period: 1939\u20131949==\n===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===\nBergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), an English language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Ingrid: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick.\"\n\nBergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\".<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind'', our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick\", Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135\u2013136}}}}\n\n''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said \"She is sensational\", as an actress. This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", writes ''Life'', adding that workmen go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n===''Casablanca'' (1942)===\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]\nAfter the onset of World War II, Bergman \"felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds, \"Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi extermination camps]]\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293\u2013295}} In 1945, she and her first husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, who wed on 10 July 1937 in [[St\u00f6de]],<ref name=\"auto2\"/> became United States citizens.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAfter completing a final film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (''[[Adam Had Four Sons]]'', ''[[Rage in Heaven]]'', and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', all 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by [[Paul Henreid]], an \"anti-Nazi underground hero\" who is in [[Casablanca]], a haven from the Nazis.<ref name=Chandler/> Bergman did not consider ''Casablanca'' to be one of her favorite performances. \"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ingridbergman.com/|title=Ingrid Bergman - The Official Licensing Website of Ingrid Bergman|website=Ingrid Bergman|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> In later years, she stated, \"I feel about ''Casablanca'' that it has a life of its own.

For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film was taken from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|same title]] and co-starred [[Gary Cooper]]. When the book was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]], Hemingway stated that, \"Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part\". His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, ''Intermezzo'', although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her, he said, \"You ''are'' Maria!\".<ref name=LifeMag>Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean.

Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on [[DVD]].\n\nBetween motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops.

Swedish actress who starred in a variety of European and American films, television movies, and plays.<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 1 September 1982.</ref> She won [[List of awards and nominations received by Ingrid Bergman|many accolades]], including three [[Academy Awards]], two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Tony Award]], four [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and a [[BAFTA Award]].\n\nBergman was born in [[Stockholm]] to a Swedish father and a German mother, and started her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).  In addition to the classic and Best-Picture-Academy-Award winning ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]], her notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), with [[Gregory Peck]], and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), opposite [[Cary Grant]].\n\nIn 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed.  She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), the debut film for Yul Brynner, winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1958, she starred for a second time with Cary Grant, this time in the popular romantic comedy ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]''.\n\nIn her later years, she won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation) in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late-Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. She died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.<ref name=James>{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}</ref> In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O. Selznick]] once called her \"the most completely conscientious actress\" he had ever worked with.

Her father, who was an artist and photographer, died when she was 13. In the years before he died, he wanted her to become an opera star, and had her take voice lessons for three years. But she always \"knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress\", sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|upright|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934), at age 19]]\nAfter her father's death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who died of heart disease only six months later. She then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. Another aunt she visited, Elsa Adler, whom Ingrid called \"Mutti\", reportedly told a family legend to the 11-year-old<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}\n\nLater, Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1935), although she reportedly had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[Intermezzo]]'' (1936) which is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her, and ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]]'', which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).\n\n==Hollywood period: 1939\u20131949==\n===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===\nBergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), an English language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Ingrid: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick.\"\n\nBergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\".<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind'', our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick\", Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135\u2013136}}}}\n\n''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said \"She is sensational\", as an actress. This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", writes ''Life'', adding that workmen go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n===''Casablanca'' (1942)===\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]\nAfter the onset of World War II, Bergman \"felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions).

Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on [[DVD]].\n\nBetween motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops.
