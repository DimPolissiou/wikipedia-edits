She is currently the head coach for [[Triplets (basketball)|Triplets]] in the [[BIG3]] professional basketball league, as well as a studio analyst for [[Orlando Magic]] broadcasts on [[Fox Sports Florida]]. Leslie played in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). She is a three-time WNBA [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] and a four-time Olympic gold medal winner. The number-seven pick in the 1997 inaugural WNBA draft, she followed her career at the [[University of Southern California]] with eight WNBA All-Star selections and two [[WNBA Championship|WNBA championships]] over the course of eleven seasons with the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], before retiring in 2009.<ref name=\"nbc\" /> Leslie was the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. In 2015, she was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]. Leslie was also inducted into the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nLeslie was born in Gardena, California, the daughter of Christine Lauren Leslie, who stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}}, and Walter Leslie, a semi-professional basketball player.  Christine started her own [[truck driver|truck driving]] business to support her three children. Walter left the family when her mother was four months pregnant with her.<ref name=\"porter\"/> Leslie has two sisters: Dionne, who is five years older, and Tiffany, who is eight years younger. She also has a brother, Elgin (named after [[Elgin Baylor]] of the LA Lakers). She played on an all-girls team with the record 33\u20131.<ref name=\"jockbio\">{{cite web |url=http://jockbio.com/Bios/Leslie/Leslie_bio.html |title=Lisa Leslie Biography |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |publisher=Black Book Partners |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===Middle school===\nDuring the first few weeks of middle school, a classmate begged Leslie to help out the basketball team.<ref name=\"grundy\" /> On her first day of basketball tryouts, team members were told to split into two groups for layup drills: [[Handedness|lefties]] and [[Handedness|righties]]. Leslie was the only lefty in the group, so from then on, she decided to become right-hand dominant so she would not have to stand in a line by herself. That decision worked to her advantage, as she became ambidextrous.<ref name=\"lipstick\">Leslie, Lisa, and Larry Barnett. Don't Let the Lipstick Fool You. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp., 2008</ref>\n\nIn eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls' basketball team, and joined a boys' basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence in her playing abilities.<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\n===High school===\nAt the age of 14, before Leslie had even started high school at Morningside, she received more than a hundred college recruiting letters, including some from top [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] programs at the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|University of Tennessee]] and [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\nLeslie continued her education in 1986 by enrolling at [[Morningside High School]] in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref name=\"porter\" /> She made an immediate impact on the basketball program, starting every game for the girl's varsity team. She also found time to join the volleyball team and compete in track and field. She ended up being a state qualifier in the 400-meter run and the high jump.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />\n\nBy the time she was a sophomore in high school, she was able to dunk the ball in the open court, even though she was not able to palm the ball. She was her team's leading scorer and rebounder and led them to the 1989 California state championship. Leslie was so talented that she was invited to participate in the USA's Junior World Championship team.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />  Entering her senior year, she developed into the top player in the country. She led her team to a state championship averaging 27 points and 15 rebounds per game.<ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n==College career==\nLeslie decided to stay close to home and attend women's  basketball powerhouse the [[University of Southern California]] from 1990\u20131994.<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.makeithappen.com/wis/bios/lesliel.html |title=Women in Sports |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Meyer, Jan |publisher= |year=1997}}</ref> She graduated from USC with a bachelor's degree in communications and later completed her master's degree in business administration<ref name=\"peter\">{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/news?slug=jo-leslie072108&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Day in the life of Lisa Leslie |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Peter, Josh |publisher=Yahoo |date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> from the [[University of Phoenix]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7DE113CF934A25752C0A96F9C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all SPORTS OF THE TIMES; University Sells Itself During Playoffs] NYTimes Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.wireimage.com/ItemListings.aspx?igi=66148&nbc1=1 [[Los Angeles Sparks]] Lisa Leslie Receives her Masters at University of Phoenix]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} WireImage Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref>\n\nLeslie played in a total of 120 college games, averaging 20.1 points, hitting 53.4% of her shots, and knocking down 69.8% of her free throws.

She co-founded [[Wilson Phillips]] with her younger sister [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and childhood friend [[Chynna Phillips]] when they were in their teens. They released two albums, ''[[Wilson Phillips (album)|Wilson Phillips]]'' and ''[[Shadows and Light (Wilson Phillips album)|Shadows and Light]]'', which between them sold 12 million copies. The group also charted three No. 1 singles and six top 20 hits in the United States before disbanding in 1993.\n\nCarnie & Wendy Wilson continued to record together, releasing the Christmas album ''[[Hey Santa!]]'' in 1993. They joined with their father for a critically successful (yet commercially unsuccessful) 1997 album, ''[[The Wilsons]]''. She also sang \"Our Time Has Come\" with [[James Ingram]] for the 1997 animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''.\n\nIn 2003, Carnie attempted to launch a solo music career with the album ''For the First Time.'' The album featured a remake of the [[Olivia DiNucci]]-penned [[Samantha Mumba]] ballad \"[[Don't Need You To (Tell Me I'm Pretty)]],\" retitled \"I Don't Need You To,\" as its first single. However, the single failed to gain interest and the album was ultimately shelved when Carnie regrouped with Wendy and Chynna as [[Wilson Phillips]] in 2004.\n\nReunited, the band released a third album, named ''California,'' which appeared on [[Sony Music]]'s record label. The album featured cover songs primarily from the 1960s and 1970s, and specifically highlights the musical glory days of their parents' California-based musical groups: [[The Mamas & the Papas]] and [[the Beach Boys]].\n\nIn 2006, Carnie released an album of [[lullabies]], ''A Mother's Gift: Lullabies from the Heart'',<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-mothers-gift-lullabies-from-the-heart-r831717 ''A Mother's Gift: Lullabies from the Heart'' Carnie Wilson] Allmusic.com, Review by Rob Theakston</ref> created shortly after the birth of her daughter, Lola.

She co-founded [[Wilson Phillips]] with her younger sister [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and childhood friend [[Chynna Phillips]] when they were in their teens. They released two albums, ''[[Wilson Phillips (album)|Wilson Phillips]]'' and ''[[Shadows and Light (Wilson Phillips album)|Shadows and Light]]'', which between them sold 12 million copies. The group also charted three No. 1 singles and six top 20 hits in the United States before disbanding in 1993.\n\nCarnie & Wendy Wilson continued to record together, releasing the Christmas album ''[[Hey Santa!]]'' in 1993. They joined with their father for a critically successful (yet commercially unsuccessful) 1997 album, ''[[The Wilsons]]''. She also sang \"Our Time Has Come\" with [[James Ingram]] for the 1997 animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''.\n\nIn 2003, Carnie attempted to launch a solo music career with the album ''For the First Time.'' The album featured a remake of the [[Olivia DiNucci]]-penned [[Samantha Mumba]] ballad \"[[Don't Need You To (Tell Me I'm Pretty)]],\" retitled \"I Don't Need You To,\" as its first single. However, the single failed to gain interest and the album was ultimately shelved when Carnie regrouped with Wendy and Chynna as [[Wilson Phillips]] in 2004.\n\nReunited, the band released a third album, named ''California,'' which appeared on [[Sony Music]]'s record label. The album featured cover songs primarily from the 1960s and 1970s, and specifically highlights the musical glory days of their parents' California-based musical groups: [[The Mamas & the Papas]] and [[the Beach Boys]].\n\nIn 2006, Carnie released an album of lullabies, ''A Mother's Gift: Lullabies from the Heart'',<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-mothers-gift-lullabies-from-the-heart-r831717 ''A Mother's Gift: Lullabies from the Heart'' Carnie Wilson] Allmusic.com, Review by Rob Theakston</ref> created shortly after the birth of her daughter, Lola.

It was somewhere during this time as a student that Leung was contacted by the FBI for information on some of her acquaintances.\n\nShe was appointed by philanthropist [[Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson]] as President of the Los Angeles-[[Guangzhou]] Sister City Committee<ref name=\"davidwise\">{{cite book|last=Wise|first=David|title=Tiger Trap: America's Secret Spy War with China|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date=2011|page=38|isbn=9780547554877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Izv2WDDa7EC&pg=PA38 }}</ref> and raised funds for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Involvement with the FBI==\n\n===Subject of investigation===\nIn 1980, Leung moved to [[Los Angeles]] and occupied an apartment building which contained numerous tenants that were subjects of other FBI investigations.  She developed a close relationship with a pro-PRC activist who was under FBI investigation for illegally transferring technology from the U.S. to the PRC.  Leung became the general manager of an import-export company which in late 1980 had become the subject of an FBI investigation dealing with the illegal transfer of technology from the U.S. to the PRC.  On February 10, 1981, the FBI launched an investigation into Leung, believing that she was engaging in [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] intelligence-gathering on behalf of the PRC.  Leung eventually left her job at the import-export company, closing the FBI investigation on her. The PRC activist was arrested in China, closing that investigation as well.\n\n=== Conversion into an FBI asset ===\n\nIn 1982, [[James J. Smith|FBI Special Agent James J. Smith]] re-opened the FBI investigation into Leung hoping that she could provide him with additional information on the PRC activist as well as other miscellaneous information. Smith was so impressed with the information Leung provided that he converted her into an FBI asset codename \"Parlor Maid\" in December of the same year.\n\n=== Career as a double agent ===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Vlcsnap-4144970.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Katrina Leung with former President of the People's Republic of China [[Jiang Zemin]]]] -->\n\nOn March 16, 1984, Leung became a U.S. citizen with the help of Smith. The FBI had developed a plan for her to be recruited by the Chinese [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] as an asset working as a [[double agent]] for the United States. In June 1984, Leung was recruited by the MSS believing that she was a low-level source of information at the FBI's Los Angeles office.  Leung began receiving money from the FBI to pay for her expenses (the majority going towards flights to and from China).  She passed two [[polygraph]] examinations: one in September 1984 and one in June 1986.\n\nBetween 1985\u20131990, Leung's profile within the West Coast Chinese community and the FBI had risen significantly. Her connections within the community had become so extensive, she had entertained Chinese diplomatic officials as well as organized high-profile banquets for visiting PRC officials from the mainland. During this time, she met and charmed [[President of the People's Republic of China|President of China]] [[Yang Shangkun]] who eventually became her [[patron]]. As a sign of her growing influence in the PRC, she advised the Chinese government in 1998 on a new location for their Los Angeles [[consulate]].\n\nUp to this point, Leung's reports were well received by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and much of her reporting during this time had also been verified by a Chinese [[defector]]. A sign of her growing influence within the FBI could be seen when she was sent to China shortly after the [[Tiananmen Square Massacre]] to report on the country's political climate during a time when the country's information flow had virtually ceased.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nIn June 1990, the FBI learned that Leung had revealed to MSS officials the existence and location of a classified operation as well as classified details of the FBI's counterintelligence program.  The FBI headquarters chief questioned Leung's handler Smith, who denied the allegations and successfully convinced his superior that she would never do such a thing without his authorization.  Smith privately confronted Leung on May 31, 1991 about the unauthorized disclosure of information. In response, she told him that her Chinese handler \"Mao\" had discovered her double-agent identity and had coerced her into giving additional information.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nIn April 1991, the FBI obtained an audio recording of a conversation between a woman identifying herself as \"Luo\" and a known PRC intelligence official identifying himself as \"Mao\".  Special Agent William Cleveland, Jr. was brought in to listen to the tape and immediately recognized the woman's voice as Leung's.  Leung had, among other things, detailed without authorization the itinerary of a recent trip that Cleveland had taken with the State Department to the PRC. Cleveland immediately notified Smith of the breach and in May of the same year, the two traveled to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. for a high-level meeting concerning herself. In addition to the analysts recommendations, Smith defended the suspicious activities of Leung and managed to convince his superiors that terminating her as an asset was not the best course of action.  The FBI accepted his recommendation based on his extensive experience handling Leung, as well as his experience in the FBI and the analyst's recommendation.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Federal prosecutors alleged Leung engaged in a 20-year extra-marital affair with Smith.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/05/08/double.agent.charges/ Alleged Chinese double agent indicted].

On December 16, 2005, Leung pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI and one count of filing a false federal tax return. Leung was sentenced to the terms of her [[plea agreement]], which stated that she must cooperate in full debriefings, three years [[probation]], 100 hours of [[community service]], and a US$10,000 [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[James J.
