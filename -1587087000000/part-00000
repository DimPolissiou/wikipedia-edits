Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]], and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said \"I will put a light on it.\" His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts' now-150 acre campus, straddling [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]. It was also in 1852 that the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote \"virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended.\" During his tenure, Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Now more than 160 years old, Tufts is the third-oldest college in the Boston area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |title=Massachusetts's Oldest Colleges \u2013 College Rankings \u2013 College Prowler |publisher=Colleges.niche.com |accessdate=August 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814054952/http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |archivedate=August 14, 2014  }}</ref>\n\nHaving been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the College, [[Hosea Ballou II]] became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year.

President Ballou died in 1861 and was succeeded by [[Alonzo Ames Miner]]. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. These include the establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include [[Goddard College|Goddard Seminary]], [[Westbrook College|Westbrook Seminary]], and [[Dean College|Dean Academy]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. By 1869, the [[Crane Theological School]] was organized.<ref>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Tufts College}}</ref>\n\nMiner's successor, [[Elmer Capen]] was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators was [[Amos Dolbear]]. In 1875, as chair of the physics department, he installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later [[Alexander Graham Bell]] would receive the patent. Dolbear's work in Tufts was later continued by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]].<ref name=thennow>{{cite web |url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&now.pdf |title=Then & Now |publisher=Tufts University |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050314/http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then%26now.pdf |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other famous scholars include [[William Leslie Hooper]] who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, [[Frederick Stark Pearson]], would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure is [[Stephen M. Babcock]] who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars [[Arthur Michael]], who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and [[John Sterling Kingsley]], who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.<ref>Tufts College (1952).

T. Barnum]] was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall) was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of [[Jumbo]] the elephant, who would become the university's mascot. The building stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.\n\nOn July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted \"that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men.\" Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women. At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the [[Ph.D.]] degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|university]]. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892\u20131893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering.<ref name=\"Russell, Miller E. 1966\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[Image:Tufts1910.jpg|thumb|300px|Walnut Hill as it appeared prior to the construction of Tisch Library and steps, circa 1910.

In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the \"College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College\". Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002.\n\nTufts expanded in the 1933 with the opening of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and [[Harvard University]], funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"tuftsv-12\">{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |title=General Academic Awards |publisher=[[Medford, Massachusetts]]: Tufts University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401071609/http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDue to travel restrictions imposed by World War II, the [[Boston Red Sox]] conducted [[spring training]] for the [[1943 Major League Baseball season|1943 Major League season]] at Tufts College.<ref name=\"Snyder\">{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John|title=365 Oddball Days in Red Sox History|year=2009|publisher=Clerisy Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1578603442|page=384}}</ref> In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school's name to Tufts University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00001/chapter/T00041|encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia of Tufts History|title=Tufts University, 1852|accessdate=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923001532/http://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00001/chapter/T00041|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe university experienced some growth during the presidency of [[Jean Mayer]] (1976\u20131992).<ref name=\"nyt_mayer\">McFadden, Robert D. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/us/jean-mayer-72-nutritionist-who-led-tufts-dies.html Jean Mayer, 72, Nutritionist Who Led Tufts, Dies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191540/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/us/jean-mayer-72-nutritionist-who-led-tufts-dies.html |date=January 31, 2017 }}.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

It added Ph.D. programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984 CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corporation [[Bernard Marshall Gordon]] founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

This campus houses all undergraduates in Arts & Sciences and Engineering, the graduate programs at [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] and all of the graduate programs in Arts & Sciences and Engineering. While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms \"Uphill\" and \"Downhill\".\n\nThe \"Uphill\" portion of the campus comprises the academic and the residential \"Rez\" quad, and is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence. Classes that contributed to the building of the fence are commemorated along its length. The academic quad contains the earliest buildings and was primarily built from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. One of Tufts' first buildings, [[Ballou Hall]] was constructed from 1852\u20131854 and was designed in the Italianate style by the well known Boston architect [[Gridley James Fox Bryant]]. Ballou Hall was later restored by [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in 1955\u201356, and houses the offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans. Other notable buildings include: [[Packard Hall]] (1856), [[East Hall (Tufts University)|East Hall]] (1860), West Hall (1871), [[Goddard Chapel (Tufts University)|Goddard Chapel]] (1882), [[Goddard Hall (Tufts University)|Goddard Hall]] (1883), [[Barnum Museum of Natural History|Barnum Hall]] (1884), and [[Eaton Hall (Tufts University)|Eaton Hall]] (1908).<ref>Tolles, Bryant Franklin.

University Press of New England, {{ISBN|978-1-58465-891-7}}.</ref> The New York firm [[Whitfield & King]] was responsible for the design of Eaton Hall.\n\nThe \"Uphill\" residential quad contains more modern buildings. The most notable building is Carmichael Hall (1954), designed by [[Arland A. Dirlam]]. Dirlam also designed Bendetson Hall (1947) on the academic quad.<ref name=thennow /><ref>Sauer, Anne.

Designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form one of the main entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic quad. The engineering school is part of the Tufts's \"Downhill\" portion of campus.  Notable buildings around the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894).  Boston architect [[George Albert Clough]] is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally, Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|title=Historic Resources|accessdate=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607141020/http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|archive-date=June 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Other notable buildings downhill include the Mayer Campus Center and the Dewick Macphie Dining Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/|title=Medford-Somerville Campus Map|accessdate=March 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424014043/https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby [[Davis Square]], where Tufts makes [[payment in lieu of taxes|payments in lieu of taxes]] on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|title=ResiStat: Tufts' Contribution|accessdate=August 3, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152654/http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|archivedate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean Mayer Administration Building - Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine - North Grafton, MA - DSC04515.JPG|thumb|200px|Jean Mayer Administration Building, Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine]]\n\n===Boston===\nThe [[Tufts University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], [[Tufts University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences|Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences]], [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|School of Dental Medicine]], and the [[Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy]] are located on the Tufts Boston Health Science campus in the [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown neighborhood of Boston]], adjacent to [[Tufts Medical Center]], a 451-bed academic medical institution.

Its official corporate name is ''The Trustees of Tufts College''. The university is governed by up to forty-one trustees and no fewer than twenty-eight. The board is self-perpetuating with trustees responsible for choosing their successors. In addition to the president, the university appoints Charter Trustees (up to 30 members) who are elected by the board and Alumni Trustees (up to 10 members) who serve for up to five years. Generally, Charter Trustees are elected by majority vote of the members and Alumni Trustees are elected by alumni. The officers of the corporation include the Chair of the Board, three Vice Chairs, the Treasurer, the Secretary, the Provost, the President, who serves ex officio, and the Executive Vice President.\n\nThe [[List of Presidents of Tufts University|President of Tufts University]], who is elected by the trustees is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the Provost, the Executive Vice President, the Treasurer, and the Secretary, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.

Each school has its own faculty, and is led by a [[Dean (education)|dean]] appointed by the [[University president|president]] and the [[provost (education)|provost]] with the consent of the Board of Trustees. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are the only schools that award both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The schools offering undergraduate education are the School of Arts and Sciences (the liberal arts college offering both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree as well as the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), the School of Engineering (which offers the Bachelor of Science degree), and the School of Special Studies. The [[Jonathan M.

It offers the opportunity for students to take for-credit courses with non-academic practitioners in a variety of fields, and also from upper-level undergraduates who have a chance to design and teach their own courses. Another successful component of the Ex College is EPIIC, a year-long program begun in 1985 to immerse students in a global issue, which culminates in an annual symposium of scholars and experts from the field.\n\nGraduate education is offered in eight of the schools.

Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]], and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said \"I will put a light on it.\" His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts' now-150 acre campus, straddling [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]. It was also in 1852 that the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote \"virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended.\" During his tenure, Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Now more than 160 years old, Tufts is the third-oldest college in the Boston area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |title=Massachusetts's Oldest Colleges \u2013 College Rankings \u2013 College Prowler |publisher=Colleges.niche.com |accessdate=August 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814054952/http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |archivedate=August 14, 2014  }}</ref>\n\nHaving been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the College, [[Hosea Ballou II]] became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year. That building now bears Ballou's name.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dl.tufts.edu//view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&chapter=B00006 |title=Tufts Digital Library: tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001 |access-date=July 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629164157/http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&chapter=B00006 |archive-date=June 29, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The campus opened in August 1854. President Ballou died in 1861 and was succeeded by [[Alonzo Ames Miner]]. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. These include the establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include [[Goddard College|Goddard Seminary]], [[Westbrook College|Westbrook Seminary]], and [[Dean College|Dean Academy]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. By 1869, the [[Crane Theological School]] was organized.<ref>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Tufts College}}</ref>\n\nMiner's successor, [[Elmer Capen]] was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators was [[Amos Dolbear]]. In 1875, as chair of the physics department, he installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later [[Alexander Graham Bell]] would receive the patent. Dolbear's work in Tufts was later continued by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]].<ref name=thennow>{{cite web |url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&now.pdf |title=Then & Now |publisher=Tufts University |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050314/http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then%26now.pdf |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other famous scholars include [[William Leslie Hooper]] who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, [[Frederick Stark Pearson]], would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure is [[Stephen M. Babcock]] who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars [[Arthur Michael]], who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and [[John Sterling Kingsley]], who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.<ref>Tufts College (1952).

T. Barnum]] was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall) was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of [[Jumbo]] the elephant, who would become the university's mascot. The building stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.\n\nOn July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted \"that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men.\" Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women. At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the [[Ph.D.]] degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|university]]. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892\u20131893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering.<ref name=\"Russell, Miller E. 1966\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[Image:Tufts1910.jpg|thumb|300px|Walnut Hill as it appeared prior to the construction of Tisch Library and steps, circa 1910.

In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the \"College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College\". Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002.\n\nTufts expanded in the 1933 with the opening of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and [[Harvard University]], funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"tuftsv-12\">{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |title=General Academic Awards |publisher=[[Medford, Massachusetts]]: Tufts University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401071609/http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDue to travel restrictions imposed by World War II, the [[Boston Red Sox]] conducted [[spring training]] for the [[1943 Major League Baseball season|1943 Major League season]] at Tufts College.<ref name=\"Snyder\">{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John|title=365 Oddball Days in Red Sox History|year=2009|publisher=Clerisy Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1578603442|page=384}}</ref> In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school's name to Tufts University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00001/chapter/T00041|encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia of Tufts History|title=Tufts University, 1852|accessdate=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923001532/http://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00001/chapter/T00041|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe university experienced some growth during the presidency of [[Jean Mayer]] (1976\u20131992).<ref name=\"nyt_mayer\">McFadden, Robert D. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/us/jean-mayer-72-nutritionist-who-led-tufts-dies.html Jean Mayer, 72, Nutritionist Who Led Tufts, Dies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191540/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/us/jean-mayer-72-nutritionist-who-led-tufts-dies.html |date=January 31, 2017 }}.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

It added Ph.D. programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984 CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corporation [[Bernard Marshall Gordon]] founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

This campus houses all undergraduates in Arts & Sciences and Engineering, the graduate programs at [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] and all of the graduate programs in Arts & Sciences and Engineering. While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms \"Uphill\" and \"Downhill\".\n\nThe \"Uphill\" portion of the campus comprises the academic and the residential \"Rez\" quad, and is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence. Classes that contributed to the building of the fence are commemorated along its length. The academic quad contains the earliest buildings and was primarily built from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. One of Tufts' first buildings, [[Ballou Hall]] was constructed from 1852\u20131854 and was designed in the Italianate style by the well known Boston architect [[Gridley James Fox Bryant]]. Ballou Hall was later restored by [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in 1955\u201356, and houses the offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans. Other notable buildings include: [[Packard Hall]] (1856), [[East Hall (Tufts University)|East Hall]] (1860), West Hall (1871), [[Goddard Chapel (Tufts University)|Goddard Chapel]] (1882), [[Goddard Hall (Tufts University)|Goddard Hall]] (1883), [[Barnum Museum of Natural History|Barnum Hall]] (1884), and [[Eaton Hall (Tufts University)|Eaton Hall]] (1908).<ref>Tolles, Bryant Franklin.

University Press of New England, {{ISBN|978-1-58465-891-7}}.</ref> The New York firm [[Whitfield & King]] was responsible for the design of Eaton Hall.\n\nThe \"Uphill\" residential quad contains more modern buildings. The most notable building is Carmichael Hall (1954), designed by [[Arland A. Dirlam]]. Dirlam also designed Bendetson Hall (1947) on the academic quad.<ref name=thennow /><ref>Sauer, Anne.

Designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form one of the main entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic quad. The engineering school is part of the Tufts's \"Downhill\" portion of campus.  Notable buildings around the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894).  Boston architect [[George Albert Clough]] is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally, Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|title=Historic Resources|accessdate=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607141020/http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|archive-date=June 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Other notable buildings downhill include the Mayer Campus Center and the Dewick Macphie Dining Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/|title=Medford-Somerville Campus Map|accessdate=March 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424014043/https://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby [[Davis Square]], where Tufts makes [[payment in lieu of taxes|payments in lieu of taxes]] on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|title=ResiStat: Tufts' Contribution|accessdate=August 3, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152654/http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|archivedate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean Mayer Administration Building - Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine - North Grafton, MA - DSC04515.JPG|thumb|200px|Jean Mayer Administration Building, Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine]]\n\n===Boston===\nThe [[Tufts University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], [[Tufts University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences|Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences]], [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|School of Dental Medicine]], and the [[Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy]] are located on the Tufts Boston Health Science campus in the [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown neighborhood of Boston]], adjacent to [[Tufts Medical Center]], a 451-bed academic medical institution.

Its official corporate name is ''The Trustees of Tufts College''. The university is governed by up to forty-one trustees and no fewer than twenty-eight. The board is self-perpetuating with trustees responsible for choosing their successors. In addition to the president, the university appoints Charter Trustees (up to 30 members) who are elected by the board and Alumni Trustees (up to 10 members) who serve for up to five years. Generally, Charter Trustees are elected by majority vote of the members and Alumni Trustees are elected by alumni. The officers of the corporation include the Chair of the Board, three Vice Chairs, the Treasurer, the Secretary, the Provost, the President, who serves ex officio, and the Executive Vice President.\n\nThe [[List of Presidents of Tufts University|President of Tufts University]], who is elected by the trustees is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the Provost, the Executive Vice President, the Treasurer, and the Secretary, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.

Each school has its own faculty, and is led by a [[Dean (education)|dean]] appointed by the [[University president|president]] and the [[provost (education)|provost]] with the consent of the Board of Trustees. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are the only schools that award both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The schools offering undergraduate education are the School of Arts and Sciences (the liberal arts college offering both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree as well as the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), the School of Engineering (which offers the Bachelor of Science degree), and the School of Special Studies. The [[Jonathan M.

It offers the opportunity for students to take for-credit courses with non-academic practitioners in a variety of fields, and also from upper-level undergraduates who have a chance to design and teach their own courses. Another successful component of the Ex College is EPIIC, a year-long program begun in 1985 to immerse students in a global issue, which culminates in an annual symposium of scholars and experts from the field.\n\nGraduate education is offered in eight of the schools.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700. Mando's Opelika operations continue to produce brake calipers and suspension modules to support its customer base located throughout the U.S.\n\nWith a capital investment of $76.5 million, Pharmavite, a global leader and manufacturer of Nature Made dietary supplements began production in January 2013 and created 280 new jobs to Opelika and the surrounding area. As of April 2014, Pharmavite's capital investment in Opelika totaled more than $89 million. In addition, Pharmavite has implemented a third expansion, with a capital investment of $21.6 million and 54 new jobs scheduled over the next three years. In March 2019, Pharmavite announced a $8.9 million expansion and 18 new employees bringing the company's total investment to Opelika's economy to $144 million and the total number of jobs created to a total of 412.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, a 67-acre site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park became a Certified Food Site through Primus Builders, Inc./Garner Economics, LLC. The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components. The total capital investment as of June 2019 is $23.1 million with 159 jobs created.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Golden State Foods Corp, one of the largest diversified suppliers to the quick-service restaurant and retail industries, announced its decision to build a new state-of-the-art meat processing facility using the certified food site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park. Mayor Gary Fuller, Secretary of Commerce Greg Canfield, and Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the announcement, along with Golden State Foods Corp company officials by video conference. The capital investment in the facility is estimated to be between $40 and $45 million. Golden State Foods will create 173 new jobs in Opelika. Wayne Morgan, Corporate Vice President, President Meat Group Golden State Foods, said the company selected Opelika as the site for their new facility \"based on the strategic location along I-85, the available workforce and the atmosphere of industry and government cooperation.\" Golden State Foods was established in 1947 and currently serves more than 125,000 restaurants from its 45 locations on five continents. With about 5,000 associates worldwide, Golden State Foods' core businesses include processing and distribution of liquid products, meat products, produce, dairy, and other services, providing a variety of networked solutions for the total supply chain spectrum.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1469&title=GOLDEN+STATE+FOODS+CORP+LOCATING+IN+OPELIKA</ref> As of June 2019, Golden State Foods has a total capital investment of $77.7 million and has created 173 jobs.\n\nDinan Engineering, a company known for the high-performance aftermarket products it makes for cars, relocated to Opelika, Alabama in April 2018. This addition will bring 13+ jobs to Opelika.\n\nCar Tech, LLC established operations in Opelika, Alabama with a capital investment of $72 million and the agreement to create 200 jobs in Opelika for manufacturing automotive equipment.\n\nYongsan Automotive USA, Inc. established its first U.S. location in Opelika, Alabama with an investment of more than $5.5 million for manufacturing equipment and building improvements and the creation of 150 new jobs over a three-year period. The company leased an existing building on Jeter Avenue in the Fox Run Business Park in March 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, two industries announced expansions in Opelika.

One part of the reason this area received this ranking is that Opelika is home to Robert Trent Jones Grand National. The site for the course, which hugs the edge of Lake Saugahatchee in Opelika's northwest, was described by Jones as the \"single greatest\" site for a golf complex that he had ever seen. The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika. Indian Pines Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course that has a par 71 course with summer Bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter.\n\nThe Alabama Recreation and Parks Association awarded the Opelika Sportsplex and Aquatics Center the 2010 Facility of the Year Award for cities with populations of 15,001 people or more.\n\nThe City of Opelika was honored by the Alabama League of Municipalities at the Statewide conference in May, 2010.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700. Mando's Opelika operations continue to produce brake calipers and suspension modules to support its customer base located throughout the U.S.\n\nWith a capital investment of $76.5 million, Pharmavite, a global leader and manufacturer of Nature Made dietary supplements began production in January 2013 and created 280 new jobs to Opelika and the surrounding area. As of April 2014, Pharmavite's capital investment in Opelika totaled more than $89 million. In addition, Pharmavite has implemented a third expansion, with a capital investment of $21.6 million and 54 new jobs scheduled over the next three years. In March 2019, Pharmavite announced a $8.9 million expansion and 18 new employees bringing the company's total investment to Opelika's economy to $144 million and the total number of jobs created to a total of 412.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, a 67-acre site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park became a Certified Food Site through Primus Builders, Inc./Garner Economics, LLC. The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components. The total capital investment as of June 2019 is $23.1 million with 159 jobs created.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Golden State Foods Corp, one of the largest diversified suppliers to the quick-service restaurant and retail industries, announced its decision to build a new state-of-the-art meat processing facility using the certified food site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park. Mayor Gary Fuller, Secretary of Commerce Greg Canfield, and Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the announcement, along with Golden State Foods Corp company officials by video conference. The capital investment in the facility is estimated to be between $40 and $45 million. Golden State Foods will create 173 new jobs in Opelika. Wayne Morgan, Corporate Vice President, President Meat Group Golden State Foods, said the company selected Opelika as the site for their new facility \"based on the strategic location along I-85, the available workforce and the atmosphere of industry and government cooperation.\" Golden State Foods was established in 1947 and currently serves more than 125,000 restaurants from its 45 locations on five continents. With about 5,000 associates worldwide, Golden State Foods' core businesses include processing and distribution of liquid products, meat products, produce, dairy, and other services, providing a variety of networked solutions for the total supply chain spectrum.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1469&title=GOLDEN+STATE+FOODS+CORP+LOCATING+IN+OPELIKA</ref> As of June 2019, Golden State Foods has a total capital investment of $77.7 million and has created 173 jobs.\n\nDinan Engineering, a company known for the high-performance aftermarket products it makes for cars, relocated to Opelika, Alabama in April 2018. This addition will bring 13+ jobs to Opelika.\n\nCar Tech, LLC established operations in Opelika, Alabama with a capital investment of $72 million and the agreement to create 200 jobs in Opelika for manufacturing automotive equipment.\n\nYongsan Automotive USA, Inc. established its first U.S. location in Opelika, Alabama with an investment of more than $5.5 million for manufacturing equipment and building improvements and the creation of 150 new jobs over a three-year period. The company leased an existing building on Jeter Avenue in the Fox Run Business Park in March 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, two industries announced expansions in Opelika. West Fraser, Inc., will be constructing a new planer mill, which will increase its manufacturing capabilities. West Fraser is one of the largest lumber manufacturers in the United States, with 45 facilities in Western Canada and the southern U.S. They offer sustainable forestry, high-efficiency wood products. The company plans to invest an additional $43 million. The total investment of West Fraser since 2005 in Opelika's economy as of the June 2019 expansion is $148.3 million. Hanwha will invest an additional $32 million in capital and create 128 new jobs within the next three years. Hanwha has four production bases in the U.S. and manufactures high-quality lightweight composite materials and auto parts. Hanwha, formerly Maxforma Plastics has provided a total capital investment of $122.3 million and has created 518 jobs since 2005.\n\nThe TigerTown retail shopping complex continues to expand its commercial developments with restaurants such as [[Chick-Fil-A]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Olive Garden]].\nTigerTown's most recent additions include PetSmart, Men's Warehouse, Shoe Station, [[Newk's Eatery]], Full Moon Bar-B-Q, and Cook Out. A new development adjacent to Tiger Town has recently been constructed and offers retail and restaurant favorites such as Tazikis, Chipotle and BurgerFi.\n\nOpelika is also  home to AMC Cinema's Tiger 13, a 55,000-square-foot, 13-screen movie theater. The theater includes the \"Big D Digital Experience\", a theater featuring an 80-foot screen with approximately 580 seats.\n\nOpelika has received several honors for its success in attracting new business. In 2004, the city of Opelika's Economic Development Department was named one of the top 10 economic development groups in North America by ''Site Selection'' magazine, a national industry trade publication covering corporate real estate management and economic development.

In its first year of program participation, Opelika High School had 63 more course enrollments in rigorous AP classes than in the year prior and students earned qualifying scores on 45 AP exams. Driving the increases in student achievement is the implementation of the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE)/A+ College Ready AP Program, which OHS began implementing in 2014. The goals of the program are to boost student enrollment and achievement, particularly for under-represented student groups in rigorous AP courses and to build a pipeline of students better prepared for college and careers.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1545&title=Opelika+High+School+among+Alabama+Schools+Lauded+as+National+Champions+in+Advanced+Placement</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, renovations and new construction began on Opelika High School.

One part of the reason this area received this ranking is that Opelika is home to Robert Trent Jones Grand National. The site for the course, which hugs the edge of Lake Saugahatchee in Opelika's northwest, was described by Jones as the \"single greatest\" site for a golf complex that he had ever seen. The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika. Indian Pines Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course that has a par 71 course with summer Bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter.\n\nThe Alabama Recreation and Parks Association awarded the Opelika Sportsplex and Aquatics Center the 2010 Facility of the Year Award for cities with populations of 15,001 people or more.\n\nThe City of Opelika was honored by the Alabama League of Municipalities at the Statewide conference in May, 2010.

In their remarks, league leaders noted \"Your exemplary program demonstrates a strong commitment to improving the quality of life in the City of Opelika...your program exhibits the type of innovation that the National League of Cities is looking to recognize.\"\nThis $32 million, {{convert|75,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex is the largest project ever undertaken by the City of Opelika in its 155-year history,  representing the first-ever public-private partnership, with businesses, corporations and private individuals.\nThe idea began with a survey that was conducted in the early 2000s (decade) that concluded that the citizens of Opelika wanted a \"family oriented\" facility that would offer a wide variety of activities where everyone could have fun together. The city's governing body set out to make the dream a reality, and soon resolutions were passed by the city council authorizing the city to move forward with the plans.\nOn February 21, 2008, after years of preparation and fundraising, groundbreaking ceremonies were held.  On August 31, 2009 \u2013 on schedule and on budget \u2013 Opelika's new state-of-the-art Sportsplex & Aquatics Center opened its doors to the public.\n\nThe Lewis Cooper Jr. Memorial Library in Opelika received the 2019 Gold Standard Award for Public Libraries.

The station is owned by [[Gray Television]], as part of a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]]-licensed dual [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]/[[The CW Plus|CW+]] affiliate [[WVFX]] (channel 10). The two stations share studios on Television Drive in [[Bridgeport, West Virginia|Bridgeport]] (along [[Interstate 79|I-79]]/[[Jennings Randolph]] Expressway) and transmitter facilities in an [[unincorporated area#United States|unincorporated area]] between Clarksburg and [[Arlington, Harrison County, West Virginia|Arlington]]. On [[cable television|cable]], WDTV is available on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]], [[Suddenlink Communications|Suddenlink]], and [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 5.\n\n==History==\n[[File:WDTV logo 2013.png|thumb|left|upright|WDTV logo from 2013 to 2018.]]\nIt signed-on as '''WJPB-TV''' on March 17, 1954 as the second television station in the [[media market|market]] licensed to [[Fairmont, West Virginia|Fairmont]]. WJPB was a primary [[NBC]] affiliate but maintained secondary relations with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and CBS. [[WTAP-TV]] in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]] was technically the area's first outlet having launched October 8, 1953. That station cleared programming from NBC, CBS, and ABC but was intended to be a primary NBC outlet. Originally, there were plans calling for WJPB to join WTAP (located seventy miles to the west) and turn North-Central West Virginia into one large market. However, the latter's analog signal on UHF channel 15 was not strong enough to reach across the very rugged [[dissected plateau]] to provide Fairmont, Clarksburg, and Weston with adequate reception. Likewise, WJPB's analog signal on UHF channel 35 did not reach Parkersburg.\n\nThose two issues, combined with the fact UHF converters were very expensive, led the station to shut down on February 28, 1955. Meanwhile, the area's third station [[WBOY-TV]] signed-on from Clarksburg on November 17, 1957. That was originally intended to be the ABC affiliate for all of North-Central West Virginia. After it became clear Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont and Parkersburg were going to be separate markets, WBOY joined NBC and remains with the network to this day. On December 30, 1959, WJPB's owner was awarded a construction permit for an analog signal on the more desirable VHF channel 5. It signed back on in June 1960 as a sole ABC affiliate licensed to Weston. In 1965, the station changed its [[call letters]] to '''WDTV'''. The calls had previously been used from 1949 until 1954 on what is now CBS [[owned-and-operated station|O&O]] [[KDKA-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. The call sign was reportedly chosen for use on this West Virginia outlet \"in honor\" of KDKA which had been a charter affiliate with [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] and served as the default station to Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont.\n\nIn 1967, WDTV switched primary affiliation to CBS. As a result, it is one of the few TV stations in the country that has held a primary affiliation with all [[Big Three television networks|\"Big Three\" networks]]. However, for many years it continued sharing ABC with WBOY and aired select [[ESPN on ABC|sports programming]] from the network since the market was one of the few in the country without a primary ABC affiliate. The area's cable companies piped in [[WTAE-TV]] from Pittsburgh to bring the full ABC schedule to the area. At some point in 1981, WDTV and WBOY dropped ABC altogether. The network would not return to a Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont based station until August 1, 2008 when WBOY launched a new second [[digital subchannel]] to offer the network. WDTV aired programming from [[UPN]] on its second digital subchannel until September 18, 2006 when the network merged with [[The WB]] to form [[The CW]]. WVFX, at the time owned separately from this station, became an affiliate with the new combined service (through [[The CW Plus]]) on a second digital subchannel.\n\nIn 2007, WVFX's owner, Davis Television, sold that station to [[Withers Broadcasting]]. Since the Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont market has only five full-powered stations, this amount is too few to allow a duopoly under normal [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) guidelines. However, Withers obtained a \"failed station\" waiver allowing the purchase to go through. [[Gray Television]] announced on May 13, 2016 that it would acquire WDTV and WVFX for $26.5 million.<ref name=\"tvnc-saletogray\">{{cite news|title=Gray Buying WDTV-WVFX Clarksburg, WV|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/94755/gray-buying-wdtvwvfx-clarksburg-wv|accessdate=May 13, 2016|work=TVNewsCheck|date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> Gray assumed control of the stations through a [[local marketing agreement]] on June 1.<ref name=\"fcc-saletogray\">{{cite web|title=Application For Consent To Assignment Of Broadcast Station Construction Permit Or License|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1726623&Service=DT&Form_id=314&Facility_id=70592|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=May 19, 2016|date=May 18, 2016}}</ref> The sale was completed on May 1, 2017.<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1756111&Service=DT&Form_id=905&Facility_id=70592 Consummation Notice], ''CDBS Public Access'', [[Federal Communications Commission]], Retrieved 2 May 2017.</ref>\n\nThe northern West Virginia television market geography is unusual, as [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] (including [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]]) and [[Preston County, West Virginia|Preston County]] are assigned to the Pittsburgh market. Although WDTV had been carried on cable in Morgantown since 1965, none of the Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont market stations were available on satellite in those counties, as the FCC could not allow satellite providers to carry them. A change in the law removed this restriction; one of the stated goals was to allow \"orphan counties\" such as Monongalia and Preston \u2013 those served on satellite only by stations from other states \u2013 access to stations from their own state. The Monongalia and Preston County governments petitioned to allow carriage of Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont market stations, and the market change was granted on February 2, 2018.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Petitions for Modification of the Satellite  Television Markets of WDTV, Weston, West  Virginia, and WBOY-TV and WVFX, Clarksburg,  West Virginia|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-18-113A1.pdf|website=FCC EDOCS}}</ref>\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Charleston, WDTV was available only when [[WCHS-TV]], then the CBS affiliate in the Charleston\u2013Huntington market, did not clear a network program.\n\n==Programming==\n[[broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WDTV includes ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Judge Judy]]'', among others.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wdtv news.png|thumb|right|News open seen weekdays at noon.{{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 19 April 2016}}]] -->\nWBOY historically leads WDTV in local [[Nielsen ratings]] because it operates a news bureau in Morgantown and provides other stations in the [[West Virginia Media Holdings]] group with a large amount of sports content relative to [[West Virginia University]]. However, in recent years, WDTV has been able to pull ahead in the key demographics for most of their shows, and even beats WBOY in overall viewers at times. In Summer 2005, its newscast operation and commercial production went completely digital using [[Electronic news-gathering|electronic news gathering]] [[Professional video camera#ENG cameras|cameras]]. The station was also first in West Virginia (and quite possibly the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]) to exchange audio and video files through various compression formats and high speed [[FTP servers]].\n\nAfter acquiring WVFX, WDTV made plans to produce a prime time newscast at 10 on the former. It would be the second time a broadcast has been attempted on the station in its history. In late 2010, the plans became a reality. The show is known as ''Fox 10 News at 10'' and it features the [[Fox Interactive Media]] graphics package and music theme. WVFX also simulcasts WDTV's early evening broadcasts on weeknights from 5 until 6:30. This station does not air its weekday morning show for a full two hours unlike most CBS affiliates.\n\nOn November 12, 2011, WDTV began airing their news broadcasts in high definition. It makes WDTV the third station in West Virginia to broadcast local news in high definition, following [[WTAP]] and [[WSAZ-TV]] (which, ironically, are now sister stations of WDTV).\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Susan Barnett]] - now at [[KYW-TV]]\n* [[Molly Line]] - now at [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]]\n* [[Dan Potash]] - now at [[AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh]]\n* [[Christi Paul]] - now at [[CNN]] and [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]]\n* Perry Sook - founder/chairman/CEO of [[Nexstar Media Group]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hof.nysbroadcasters.org/tv/perry-sook/|title=New York State Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame - Perry Sook|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref>\n* Andrew Havranek - now at [[KYTV (TV)|KYTV]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.wdtv.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WDTV}}\n*{{BIA|WDTV|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Clarksburg/Weston TV}}\n{{Parkersburg TV}}\n{{CBS West Virginia}}\n{{Gray TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wdtv}}\n[[Category:CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:MeTV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Heroes & Icons affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Clarksburg, West Virginia|DTV]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1954]]\n[[Category:1954 establishments in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Gray Television]]\n[[Category:Conference USA broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Washington Redskins broadcasters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|CBS affiliate in Weston, West Virginia}}\n{{About|the West Virginia television station|the [[Pittsburgh]] television station formerly known as WDTV|KDKA-TV|the consumer electronic device by [[Western Digital]]|WD TV}}\n{{infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = WDTV\n| city                     = Weston, West Virginia\n| station_logo             = WDTV Logo.png\n| logo_size                = 225px\n| station_slogan           = ''Keeping You Connected''\n| station_branding         = WDTV ''(general)''<br>''WDTV 5 News'' ''(newscasts)''\n| digital                  = 5 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n| virtual                  = 5 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| affiliations             = '''5.1:''' [[CBS]]<br>'''5.2:''' [[MeTV]]<br>'''5.3:''' [[Heroes & Icons]]<br>'''5.4:''' [[Circle (TV network)|Circle]]\n| other_chs                = \n| owner                    = [[Gray Television]]\n| licensee                 = Gray Television Licensee, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]\n| location                 = [[Weston, West Virginia|Weston]]/[[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]]/<br>[[Fairmont, West Virginia]] \n| country                  = United States\n| founded                  =\n| airdate                  = {{start date and age|1954|3|17|p=y}}\n| enddate                  =\n| callsign_meaning         = [[DuMont Television Network|'''D'''uMont '''T'''ele'''V'''ision]] (reference to previous<br>calls of [[KDKA-TV]] and its affiliation) <!-- This station launched in 1954, so the callsign does not mean 'digital television'. -->\n| sister_stations          = [[WVFX]], [[WSAZ-TV]]\n| former_callsigns         = WJPB-TV (1954\u20131965)\n| former_channel_numbers   = '''Analog:'''<br>35 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]], 1954\u20131955)<br>5 (VHF, 1960\u20132009)<br>'''Digital:'''<br>6 (VHF, until 2009)\n| former_affiliations      = [[NBC]] (1954\u20131955)<br>[[Dark (broadcasting)|Dark]] (1955\u20131960)<br>[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (1960\u20131967; secondary 1954\u20131955, 1967\u20131981)\n| effective_radiated_power = 10 [[kilowatt|kW]]<br>12.1 kW (application)\n| HAAT                     = {{convert|240|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}<br>{{convert|221.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (application)\n| class                    =\n| facility_id              = 70592\n| coordinates              = {{nowrap|{{coord|39|18|2|N|80|20|36|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}}}\n| licensing_authority      = [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]\n| homepage                 = {{URL|https://www.wdtv.com/}}\n}}\n\n'''WDTV''', [[virtual channel|virtual]] and [[very high frequency|VHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 5, is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[City of license|licensed]] to [[Weston, West Virginia|Weston]], [[West Virginia]], United States and serving [[North-Central West Virginia]].

Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009\u201310, the 1.5&nbsp;km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see [[Kapiti Line]] for more information.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]].

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009\u201310, the 1.5&nbsp;km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see [[Kapiti Line]] for more information.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced. The bridges were all over 100 years old with steel spans and timber piers, and were replaced by modern low-maintenance concrete ballast deck bridges.

In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.
