These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as \"second-generation\" models. To meet American [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver in front of the trigger guard. In 1991, an integrated recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Third-generation models ====\nIn 1998, the frame was further modified with an accessory rail (called the \"Universal Glock rail\") to allow the mounting of [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sights]], [[tactical light]]s, and other accessories. Thumb rests on both sides of the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) \"third-generation\" models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a [[Safety (firearms)#Loaded chamber indicator|loaded chamber indicator]], and the locking block was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of [[bolt thrust]] forces exerted by the locking block. This cross pin is known as the locking block pin and is located above the trigger pin.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">{{Cite book |last=Wo\u017aniak |first=Ryszard |title=Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej&nbsp;\u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141 |year=2001 |location=Warsaw |publisher=Dom Wydawniczy Bellona |language=Polish |pages=45\u201350 |isbn=9788311091498 |oclc=749611548}}</ref>\n\nThe polymer frames of third-generation models can be black, flat dark earth, or [[olive drab]]. Besides that, non-firing dummy pistols (\"P\" models) and non-firing dummy pistols with resetting triggers (\"R\" models) have a bright red frame and [[Simunition]]-adapted practice pistols (\"T\" models) \u2013 a bright blue frame for easy identification.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken |last=Lunde |url=http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |title=Ken Lunde's Pistol Wallpaper Pages\u2014Assorted Glocks (Page 1 of 3) |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014115656/http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |archivedate=October 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Glock 22 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2) (chambered in .40 S&W) was introduced.

Some of those did not have the fish gills.\n\n==== Fourth-generation models ====\nAt the 2010 [[SHOT Show]], Glock presented the \"fourth generation\", now dubbed \"Gen4\" by Glock itself.  Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Luger and .40 S&W cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. \"Gen4\" is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe basic grip size of the fourth-generation Glock pistols is slightly smaller compared to the previous design. A punch is provided to remove the standard trigger housing pin and replace it with the longer cross pin needed to mount the medium or large backstrap that will increase the trigger distance by {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} or {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. With the medium backstrap installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The magazine release catches are enlarged and reversible for left-handed use. To use the exchangeable magazine release feature, fourth-generation Glock magazines have a notch cut on both sides of the magazine body. Earlier versions of the magazines will not lock into the Gen4 pistols if the user has moved the magazine release button to be operated by a left-handed user. Gen4 magazines will work in older models.<ref>{{cite web|work=All4Shooters|title=Glock pistols Gen3 VS Gen4.

Earlier subcompact Glock models such as the Glock 26 and Glock 30 have already used a dual recoil spring assembly that was carried over to the fourth-generation versions of those models. The slide and barrel shelf have been resized, and the front portion of the polymer frame has been widened and internally enlarged, to accommodate the dual recoil spring assembly. The trigger mechanism housing has also been modified to fit into the smaller-sized grip space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |title=Ken Lunde's 2010 SHOT Show Photos & Report |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711182451/http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |archivedate=2012-07-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |title=More Gen 4 Glock Photos |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722050049/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |archive-date=2010-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation/ |title=SHOT Show 2010: GLOCK brings pistols into the next generation |publisher=Policeone.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403082901/http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation |archive-date=2010-04-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |title=Gen 4 Glock Review: Evolution, not Revolution |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152040/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |archive-date=2010-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Payton Miller |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125051923/http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-25 |title=Glock 17 Gen4 |publisher=gunsandammo.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of fourth-generation Glock pistols continued in July 2010 when the Glock 19 and Glock 23, the reduced size \"compact\" versions of the Glock 17 and Glock 22, became available for retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/News/2010/04/29/Glock-19-and-23-Gen4-Will-Arrive-This-Summer.aspx|title=Glock Gen4 G19 and G23 Will Arrive This Summer|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225174421/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/news/2010/04/29/glock-19-and-23-gen4-will-arrive-this-summer.aspx|archive-date=25 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In late 2010, Glock continued the introduction of fourth-generation models with the Glock 26 and Glock 27 \"subcompact\" variants.\n\nIn January 2013, more fourth-generation Glock pistols were introduced commercially during the annual SHOT Show, including the Glock 20 Generation 4 along with other fourth-generation Glock models.\n\n=====2011 recoil spring assembly exchange program=====\nIn September 2011, Glock announced a recoil spring exchange program in which the manufacturer voluntarily offers to exchange the recoil spring assemblies of its fourth-generation pistols (with the exception of the \"subcompact\" Glock 26 and Glock 27 models) sold before 22 July 2011 at no cost \"to ensure our products perform up to GLOCK\u2019s stringent standards\", according to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |title=Recoil Spring Exchange Program |publisher=Glock USA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124080900/http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== M series ====\nOn 29 June 2016 the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) awarded a contract to Glock to provide new 9\u00d719mm Parabellum chambered duty pistols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|title=Glock wins $85 million FBI contract|first=Aaron|last=Smith|date=2016-06-30|access-date=2016-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195243/http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|archive-date=2016-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The solicitation specifications deviated from the specifications of Glock fourth-generation models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=3003911f9f7ff35889bf5f46c48ba0ef&tab=core&_cview=1|title=9mm Luger Pistols / Replacement Parts -

During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.<ref name=\"Kokalis\">Kokalis, Peter: ''Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of Soldier of Fortune'', page 320. Paladin Press, 2001.</ref>\n\nGlock pistols incorporate a number of features intended to enhance reliability in adverse conditions, such as utilizing  advanced metal coatings, \"stub\" slide guides instead of true frame rails, and an unusual cocking mechanism wherein the trigger is partially responsible for cocking the striker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/glock-17-gen-4-review-and-dirt-test-2019.html|title=Glock 17 Gen 4 Review and Dirt Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> By relying partially on force from the shooter's trigger finger to cock the striker, a Glock effectively reduces the load on the recoil spring as the slide moves forward into battery, whereas almost all other striker-fired pistols on the market rely fully on the recoil spring to cock the striker. This design gives the recoil spring fewer tasks as the action cycles, helping to ensure that sufficient energy is available to strip a new round from the magazine and achieve full battery even when the breech, chamber, and/or magazine are heavily fouled. For these and other reasons, Glock pistols are commonly considered to be some of the most reliable striker-fired, semi-automatic handguns available, with some independent testing even showing a Glock taking a lead over a Sig Sauer P320<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/p320-vs-glock-torture-test-which-is-best-2019.html|title=P320 vs Glock Torture Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in a wet/dry reliability test, even though the latter was selected as the winner of the U.S. Army's [[XM17 Modular Handgun System competition|MHS]] competition.\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Glock 30-JH02.jpg|thumb|A subcompact Glock 30 field stripped to its main parts with a [[.45 ACP]] round|alt=|left]]\n\nThe slide features a spring-loaded claw [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], and the stamped [[sheet metal]] ejector is pinned to the trigger mechanism housing.<ref>Glock Armorer Manual 2012 p52</ref> Pistols after 2002 have a reshaped extractor that serves as a [[loaded chamber indicator]].

As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set|preset]] trigger mechanism, referred to as the \"[[Safe action|Safe Action]]\" trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically.\n\nThe factory-standard, two-stage trigger has a trigger travel of {{convert|12.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}, but by using a modified connector, it can be increased to {{convert|35|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} or lowered to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}. In response to a request made by American law enforcement agencies for a two-stage trigger with increased trigger pull, Glock introduced the NY1 (New York) trigger module, which features a flat spring in a plastic housing that replaces the trigger bar's standard coil spring. This trigger modification is available in two versions: NY1 and NY2 that are rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|40|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} and {{convert|32|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|50|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}, respectively, which require about {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|30|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} of force to disengage the safeties and another {{convert|10|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} in the second stage to fire a shot.\n\nThe Glock's frame, magazine body, and several other components are made from a high-strength [[nylon]]-based [[polymer]] invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\">Kasler, 136</ref> This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than [[carbon steel]] and most [[Alloy steel|steel alloys]]. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, [[Corrosive substance|caustic liquids]], and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The [[Injection molding|injection-molded]] frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109\u00b0 and a nonslip, [[Stippling#Other uses|stippled]] surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/1/13/steyr-m40-a1/|title=Steyr M40-A1|website=www.shootingillustrated.com|access-date=2016-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805235909/https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/1/13/steyr-m40-a1/|archive-date=2016-08-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The frame houses the locking block, which is an [[investment casting]] that engages a 45\u00b0 camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.\n\nThe Glock pistol has a relatively low slide profile, which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistol more comfortable to fire by reducing [[muzzle rise]] and allows for faster aim recovery in rapid firing sequences.\nThe rectangular slide is [[Milling machine|milled]] from a single block of ordnance-grade steel using [[Numerical control|CNC]] machinery.<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\">Kokalis, 321</ref> The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary [[nitriding]] process called [[Tenifer]]. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a {{convert|500|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} nitrate bath.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The Tenifer finish is between {{convert|0.04|and|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on|4}} in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\">Kasler, 137</ref>\n\nThe Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, nonglare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds [[stainless steel]] specifications),<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\"/> making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed]] as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[Chrome plating#industrial chrome|hard chrome plating]], or phosphates.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing|gas nitriding]] process. After applying the nitriding process, a black [[Parkerized]] decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.<ref name=\"MetalTreatments\" />\n\nA current production Glock 17 consists of 34 parts.<ref name=\"us.glock.com\"/> For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, slide, frame, magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm is designed for the [[NATO]]-standard 9\u00d719mm Parabellum [[Handgun|pistol]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[File:Glock 17 9mmPara 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard sighting arrangement of a \"first-generation\" Glock 17]]\n\nThe hammer-forged barrel has a female type [[polygonal rifling]] with a right-hand twist. The stabilization of the round is not by conventional [[rifling]], using lands and grooves, but rather through a polygonal profile consisting of a series of six or eight interconnected noncircular segments (only the .45 ACP and .45 GAP have octagonal polygonal rifling). Each depressed segment within the interior of the barrel is the equivalent of a groove in a conventional barrel. Thus, the interior of the barrel consists of smooth arcs of steel rather than sharply defined slots.\n\nInstead of using a traditional [[Broaching (metalworking)|broaching machine]] to cut the rifling into the bore, the hammer forging process involves beating a slowly rotating [[mandrel]] through the bore to obtain the [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al shape.<ref name=\"Kasler_138\">Kasler, 138</ref> As a result, the barrel's thickness in the area of each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet,<ref name=\"Kasler_138\"/> slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.<ref name=\"Barrel History\">{{cite web |url=http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102209/http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |title=Barrels |publisher=AtlantisArms.com |date=2004 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe newer lines of Glock pistols - i.e. Gen5, G42/43 - are equipped with the ''Glock Marksmanship Barrel'', or GMB. While older barrels were somewhat difficult to identify a bullet as coming from a particular barrel with high enough reliability for evidentiary use, the newer GMB ones are designed differently. A recent study by Stephen Christen and Hans Rudolf Jordi, and published by ''Forensic Science International'' in February 2019, shows that the new GMB barrels leave more identifiably unique markings on the fired projectile. These marks were more easily identified than previous pistol barrel markings, and were sufficient for reliably tying a bullet to a particular barrel. The study used a comparison microscope and an ABIS (Evofinder).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Christen |first1=Stephan |last2=Jordi |first2=Hans Rudolf |title=Individuality testing of new Glock pistol barrels 'Marksman Barrel' |journal=Forensic Science International |date=February 2019 |volume=295 |pages=64\u201371 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.11.028 |pmid=30572221 }}</ref>\n\n=== Safety ===\nGlock pistols lack a traditional on-off safety lever, which Glock markets as an advantage, especially to police departments, as the user is able to fire immediately without separately manipulating a safety.<ref name=bloom-safety>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2009-09-09/glock-pistol-used-by-police-raised-safety-issues |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |last1=Barrett|first1=Paul |last2=Grow|first2=Brian  |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=2016-01-02 |date=2009-09-09}}</ref> Instead, the pistols are designed with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated \"Safe Action\" by Glock, consists of an external [[Trigger safety|integrated trigger safety]] and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety and a drop safety.<ref>{{cite web |title=Safe-action system on Glock.com |url=https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |accessdate=2016-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623235719/https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |archive-date=2016-06-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released.<ref name=\"Wo\u017aniak\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Paul |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115022230/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |archive-date=2010-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Glock announced the Internal Locking System (ILS) safety feature. The ILS is a manually activated lock located in the back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and, according to Glock, each key is unique. When activated, the lock causes a tab to protrude from the rear of the grip, giving both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable, as well as making it impossible to disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol. The ILS is available as an option on most Glock pistols. Glock pistols cannot be retrofitted to accommodate the ILS. The lock must be factory-built in Austria and shipped as a special order.\n\n=== Feeding ===\n[[File:Glock 17 magazine.JPG|thumb|upright|Glock 9\u00d719mm Parabellum 17-round magazine. The numbered witness holes at the back portion visually indicate how many cartridges are contained in the magazine.]]\nThe Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or double stack [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s that have a 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 24 or 33-round [[high-capacity magazine]]s.<ref>[http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm Glock magazines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208011649/http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm |date=December 8, 2010 }}</ref> For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever is located on the left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.\n\nGlock magazines are interchangeable between models of the same caliber, meaning that a compact or subcompact pistol will accept magazines designed for the larger pistols chambered for the same round. However, magazines designed for compact and subcompact models will not function in larger pistols because they are not tall enough to reach the slide and magazine release. For example, the subcompact Glock 26 will accept magazines from both the full-size Glock 17 and the compact Glock 19, but the Glock 17 will not accept magazines from the smaller Glock 19 or the Glock 26.  The magazines for the Glock 36, the Glock 42, the Glock 43, and the Glock 44 are all unique; they cannot use magazines intended for another model, nor can their magazines be used in other models.\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe Glock 17 has a fixed polymer combat-type [[iron sight|sighting arrangement]] that consists of a ramped front sight and a notched rear sight with white contrast elements painted on for increased acquisition speed \u2013 a white dot on the front post and a rectangular border on the rear notch. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage (on certain models due to the windage sights not coming as factory default),  as it has a degree of lateral movement in the dovetail it is mounted in. Three other factory rear sight configurations are available in addition to the standard {{convert|6.5|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} height sight: a lower impact {{convert|6.1|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} sight, and two higher impact versions \u2013 {{convert|6.9|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} and {{convert|7.3|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}.<ref name=\"Kokalis_322\">Kokalis, 322</ref>\n\n=== Accessories ===\n {{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 220\n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Glock34 with gtl22.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  = Glock 34 with a GTL 22 attachment featuring a dimmable xenon white light and a red laser\n   | image2    = D150211dv1047.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  = A military diver displaying a Glock 17 fitted with maritime spring cups (not visible in picture, these are part of the internal mechanism)\n   | image3    = GlockOrig.jpg\n   | alt23     =\n   | caption3  = Polymer holster for Glock pistols\n  }}\n\nThe Glock pistol accessories available from the factory include several devices for tactical illumination, such as a series of front rail-mounted \"Glock tactical lights\" featuring a white [[tactical light]] and an optional visible laser sight. An alternate version of the tactical light using an invisible [[infrared]] light and laser sight is available, designed to be used with an infrared [[night vision device]]. Another lighting accessory is an adapter to mount a flashlight onto the bottom of a magazine.\n\nPolymer holsters in various configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups are designed to allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.\n\nMagazine floor plates (or +2 baseplates), which expand the capacity of the standard magazines by two rounds, are available for models chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .45 GAP, [[.40 S&W]], [[.357 SIG]], and [[.380 ACP]] cartridges. In addition to the standard nonadjustable polymer sight line, three alternative sight lines are offered by Glock. These consist of steel, adjustable, and self-illuminating [[Tritium sights|tritium]] night rear sights and factory steel and self-illuminating tritium contrast pointer steel front sights.\n\n== Variants ==\nFollowing the introduction of the Glock 17, numerous variants and versions have been offered. Variants that differ in caliber, frame, and slide length are identified by different model numbers with the exception of the Glock 17L.\n\nGlock pistols are made in five form factors, all modeled after the original full-sized Glock 17. \"Standard\" models are designed as full-sized duty firearms with a large magazine capacity. \"Compact\" models are slightly smaller with reduced magazine capacity and lighter weight while maintaining a usable grip length. \"[[Subcompact pistols|Subcompact]]\" models are designed for easier carry and being lighter and shorter, are intended to be used with two fingers on the grip below the trigger guard and lack an accessory rail like the larger, after generation two, Glock models. The .45 ACP and [[10mm Auto]] models have bigger, wider slides and are slightly larger than the smaller-chambered pistols and are available in the subcompact models Glock 29 (10 mm) and Glock 30 (.45 ACP). Glock produces five models of single-stack \"Slimline\" subcompact pistols, the Glock 36 in .45 ACP, the Glock 42 in .380 ACP, and the Glock 43, 43x, and 48 in 9\u00d719mm. The 43x and the 48 have longer grips that allow for a full three-finger hold and a 10-round capacity. \"Competition\" versions have longer barrels and slides, adjustable sights, an extended slide and magazine release.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Glock introduced several \"Short Frame\" models designated by the suffix \"SF\". The short frame was originally designed to compete in the now cancelled U.S. military [[Joint Combat Pistol]] trials for a new .45 ACP pistol to replace the [[M9 pistol]]. Glock's entry featured an optional ambidextrous magazine release and [[Picatinny rail|MIL-STD-1913]] rail along with a reduction in the size of the backstrap. The Glock 21SF is currently available in three versions: one with a Picatinny rail and ambidextrous magazine release and two with a Universal Glock rail available with or without the ambidextrous magazine release. Current 10mm and .45 ACP Glock magazines are manufactured with ambidextrous magazine release cutouts. As of January 2009, the Glock 20, 21, 29, and 30 were offered in short-framed variations. These models incorporate a {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} reduction in trigger reach, and full-sized models feature a {{convert|4|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} reduction in heel depth, which corresponds to an overall reduction in length for those models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |title=Reuters announcement for Glock models |accessdate=2017-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416220902/http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |archive-date=2017-04-16 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/prnews/20080202/ga-glock-30-sf-45.htm \"Glock, Inc.

Several modified versions of the Glock 17 have been introduced:\n** '''Glock 17L''': Introduced in 1988, the 17L incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three holes in the top of the barrel and a corresponding slot in the slide; however, later production pistols lack the holes in the barrel. The Glock 17L is manufactured in limited quantities.\n** '''Glock 17C''': Introduced in 1996, the 17C incorporates slots cut in the barrel and slide to [[Muzzle brake|compensate for recoil]]. Many other Glock pistols now come with this option, all with a \"C\" suffix on the slide.\n** '''Glock 17MB''': The 17MB is a version with ambidextrous magazine catch. This model, along with the other MB variants, was no longer available upon the introduction of the fourth-generation models, which have a reversible magazine catch.\n** '''Glock 17M''': Introduced in 2016, the 17M was created in response to an FBI solicitation for a new 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous slide lock, rounded slide nose profile, flared magazine well with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Handgun Planet (staff) |date=March 30, 2017 |title=Glock 17M: The 'Inside' Scoop (Photo Documentary) |url=https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |publisher=Handgun Planet |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711064050/https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |archive-date=July 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[South Carolina Highway Patrol]] and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]<ref name=\"glock.com\">{{cite press release |title=Ontario Provincial Police Replaces its Current Pistols with GLOCK Pistols |url=https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |date=June 12, 2017 |publisher=U.S. Headquarters, GLOCK |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730080551/https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |archive-date=July 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> have adopted the pistol as standard.\n\n[[File:MarineCorpsGlock18.jpg|thumb|The Glock 18, chambered in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, fitted with a detachable shoulder stock and being fired in fully automatic mode]]\n[[File:Glock 18C.jpg|thumb|Glock 18C (compensated) in the third generation, unloaded and equipped with 19-rounds magazine, fire selector set to single fire]]\n\n* '''Glock 18''': The Glock 18{{Anchor|Glock 18}} is a [[selective fire|selective-fire]] variant of the Glock 17, developed at the request of the Austrian [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] unit [[EKO Cobra]], and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |title=TFB TV Glock 18 Machine Pistol Mini-Documentary |publisher=The Firearm Blog |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012043620/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally produced in 1986, this [[machine pistol]]\u2013class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires [[Automatic firearm|fully automatically]], and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semi-automatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 can be used, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19 or 24 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not including them on its official websites or its public catalogues,<ref name=\"guns.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|title=Hands-on with Glock 18: The elusive machine pistol (VIDEO)|date=7 August 2017|publisher=Guns.com|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011232935/http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement, and government organizations,<ref name=\"guns.com\"/> and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce [[muzzle rise]] during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.\n** '''Glock 18C''': The compensator cuts start about halfway back on the top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100\u20131,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the slide, frame, and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html Janes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213084320/http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |title=Glock 18 interchangeability with Glock 17 |publisher=Cybershooters.org |accessdate=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091944/https://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |archive-date=2015-06-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:GLOCK 19.JPG|thumb|The compact Glock 19 in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n* '''Glock 19''': The Glock 19 {{Anchor|Glock 19}} is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the \"Compact\" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} than the Glock 17, and it uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), 24 and 26 (standard magazine with +2 extension) and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19. [[File:Glock 19X.svg|thumb|Glock 19X proposed by [[Glock Ges.m.b.H.]] for [[XM17 Modular Handgun System competition]]]]\n** '''Glock 19X''': The 19X is the civilian version of Glock's entry to the [[XM17 Modular Handgun System competition]] for the [[US Military]]. It features a Glock 19 slide with a Glock 17 frame in coyote color instead of the regular black color the Glock usually comes in. The frame includes a lanyard loop and a front lip in the magazine which purpose is to make changing magazines with gloves on easier, but this means the new Gen 5 17-round magazines cannot be used in the Glock 19X because the front lip will block the extended magazine floor plates from locking into the 19X's magazine well. This can be remedied by switching to a Gen 4\u2013style magazine floor plate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alloutdoor.com/2018/01/08/glock-19x-magazine-compatibility-issues/ |title=Glock 19X Magazine Compatibility Issues |website=AllOutdoor.com |date=January 8, 2018 |first=Kevin |last=Felts |access-date=2019-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213123906/https://www.alloutdoor.com/2018/01/08/glock-19x-magazine-compatibility-issues/ |archive-date=2019-02-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> The 19X comes with one 17 round magazine and two 19 round magazines, all in coyote color.

It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 24, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a \"shortened\" Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring.\n* '''Glock 34''': The Glock 34 {{Anchor|Glock 34}} is a competition version of the Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a {{convert|21|mm|abbr=on|1}} longer barrel and slide. It has an extended magazine release, extended slide stop lever, {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides at the front of the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |url=http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |title=The Glock 34 |work=[[Guns (magazine)|Guns]] |date=September 1999 |publisher=The Modern Survivalist |access-date=March 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182714/http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |archive-date=March 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* '''Glock 43''': The Glock 43{{Anchor|Glock 43}} is a \"slimline\" version of the subcompact Glock 26 that features an ultracompact slide and frame. The Glock 43 is the first Glock pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack 9\u00d719mm Parabellum magazine, having a standard capacity of six rounds and being unique to the model. Unlike other subcompact Glock pistols, the Glock 43 cannot use factory magazines from its larger relatives due to its single-stack magazine design. It also does not allow the removal of the backplate grip as is possible on the 4th gen Glocks.\n** '''Glock 43X''': The 43X is similar to the 43 except it has a longer and thicker grip for an increased magazine capacity of 10 rounds. Glock 43X magazines do not fit into the Glock 43, or vice versa.

The Glock 36 is the first Glock pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack magazine, having a standard capacity of six rounds and being unique to the model. The Glock 36 cannot use factory magazines from its larger relatives due to its single-stack magazine design.\n* '''Glock 41''': The Glock 41 {{Anchor|Glock 41}} is a competition version of the Glock 21, much like what the G34 is in relation to the G17; it features a 5.3-inch barrel and an elongated slide.

The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge. The standard magazine capacity is 15 rounds. The Glock Model 22 is favored and used by multiple law enforcement agencies around the world, including the [[Baltimore Police Department]], [[Los Angeles Police Department]], [[Miami Police Department]], [[Maryland State Police]], [[Overland Park Police Department]], [[Kansas City Police Department]], [[Missouri State Highway Patrol]], and [[Alaska State Troopers]] in the United States; the [[New South Wales Police Force#Firearms|NSW Police Force]] and [[Queensland Police Service#Equipment|Queensland Police Service]] in Australia; the [[Edmonton Police Service]], [[Calgary Police Service]], [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], [[Toronto Police Service]], [[Ottawa Police Service]], and [[British Columbia Sheriff Service]] in Canada; and the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)]], among others.\n* '''Glock 23''': The Glock 23 {{Anchor|Glock 23}} is a .40 S&W version of the compact Glock 19. It is dimensionally identical to the Glock 19, but is slightly heavier and uses a modified slide, frame, .40 S&W barrel, and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds.

The factory magazines from the larger Glock 22 and 23 will function in the Glock 27, increasing capacity to 13 or 15 rounds.  Spacers are available that fit on these larger-capacity magazines themselves; they have the effect of \"extending\" the magazine well of the pistol, thereby improving the ergonomic feel of the pistol when the longer magazines are inserted.\n* '''Glock 35''': The Glock 35 {{Anchor|Glock 35}} is a .40 S&W version of the competition Glock 34. The Glock Model 35 was the service pistol for the [[Kentucky State Police]], but by the summer of 2017, they had reverted from the Glock 35 back to 9mm weapons because of improvements in 9mm bullets, making them superior to the Glock 35's .40 ammunition in performance and economy as measured in the standard \"FBI Protocol\" tests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klemagazine.com/home/2017/7/25/better-bullets|title=Better Bullets|last=Moore|first=Michael|date=July 2017|website=Kentucky Law Enforcement Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061606/https://www.klemagazine.com/home/2017/7/25/better-bullets|archive-date=2018-10-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs is typical of pistols chambered in .40 S&W, each of the standard Glock models (22, 23, and 27) may be easily converted to the corresponding [[.357 SIG]] chambering (Glock 31, 32, and 33, respectively) simply by replacing the barrel.

It operates via [[Blowback (arms)|straight blowback]] of the slide. This required modification of the locking surfaces on the barrel, as well as a redesign of the former locking block.  Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame.  It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system.  The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 required return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design.\n* '''Glock 25''': The Glock 25 {{Anchor|Glock 25}}, introduced in 1995, is a blowback derivative of the compact ({{convert|102|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel) Glock 19.

The standard magazine capacity is 10 rounds, but the 15-round Glock 25 magazine will function in the Glock 28.  Standard fixed-sight elevation is 6.9&nbsp;mm, unlike the 6.5&nbsp;mm elevation used for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum models.\n* '''Glock 42''': The Glock 42 {{Anchor|Glock 42}}, introduced in 2014, is an all-new locked-breech \"slimline\" ({{convert|83|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel) design. The single-stack magazine is unique to this model, with a capacity of six rounds.

It uses a wider, beveled slide, larger barrel, and different magazine, but is otherwise similar to the Glock 17. The Glock 37 first appeared in 2003. It was designed to offer ballistic performance comparable with the .45 ACP in the frame size of the Glock 17. The concern with the size of the Glock 20/21 has been addressed by the Glock 36, 21SF, and 30SF, all of which featured reduced-size frames.

These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as \"second-generation\" models. To meet American [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver in front of the trigger guard. In 1991, an integrated recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Third-generation models ====\nIn 1998, the frame was further modified with an accessory rail (called the \"Universal Glock rail\") to allow the mounting of [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sights]], [[tactical light]]s, and other accessories. Thumb rests on both sides of the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) \"third-generation\" models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a [[Safety (firearms)#Loaded chamber indicator|loaded chamber indicator]], and the locking block was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of [[bolt thrust]] forces exerted by the locking block. This cross pin is known as the locking block pin and is located above the trigger pin.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">{{Cite book |last=Wo\u017aniak |first=Ryszard |title=Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej&nbsp;\u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141 |year=2001 |location=Warsaw |publisher=Dom Wydawniczy Bellona |language=Polish |pages=45\u201350 |isbn=9788311091498 |oclc=749611548}}</ref>\n\nThe polymer frames of third-generation models can be black, flat dark earth, or [[olive drab]]. Besides that, non-firing dummy pistols (\"P\" models) and non-firing dummy pistols with resetting triggers (\"R\" models) have a bright red frame and [[Simunition]]-adapted practice pistols (\"T\" models) \u2013 a bright blue frame for easy identification.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken |last=Lunde |url=http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |title=Ken Lunde's Pistol Wallpaper Pages\u2014Assorted Glocks (Page 1 of 3) |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014115656/http://lundestudio.com/glocks.html |archivedate=October 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Glock 22 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2) (chambered in .40 S&W) was introduced.

Some of those did not have the fish gills.\n\n==== Fourth-generation models ====\nAt the 2010 [[SHOT Show]], Glock presented the \"fourth generation\", now dubbed \"Gen4\" by Glock itself.  Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Luger and .40 S&W cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. \"Gen4\" is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe basic grip size of the fourth-generation Glock pistols is slightly smaller compared to the previous design. A punch is provided to remove the standard trigger housing pin and replace it with the longer cross pin needed to mount the medium or large backstrap that will increase the trigger distance by {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} or {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. With the medium backstrap installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The magazine release catches are enlarged and reversible for left-handed use. To use the exchangeable magazine release feature, fourth-generation Glock magazines have a notch cut on both sides of the magazine body. Earlier versions of the magazines will not lock into the Gen4 pistols if the user has moved the magazine release button to be operated by a left-handed user. Gen4 magazines will work in older models.<ref>{{cite web|work=All4Shooters|title=Glock pistols Gen3 VS Gen4.

Earlier subcompact Glock models such as the Glock 26 and Glock 30 have already used a dual recoil spring assembly that was carried over to the fourth-generation versions of those models. The slide and barrel shelf have been resized, and the front portion of the polymer frame has been widened and internally enlarged, to accommodate the dual recoil spring assembly. The trigger mechanism housing has also been modified to fit into the smaller-sized grip space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |title=Ken Lunde's 2010 SHOT Show Photos & Report |publisher=Lundestudio.com |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711182451/http://lundestudio.com/2010SHOTShow/ |archivedate=2012-07-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |title=More Gen 4 Glock Photos |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722050049/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/20/more-gen-4-glock-photos/ |archive-date=2010-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation/ |title=SHOT Show 2010: GLOCK brings pistols into the next generation |publisher=Policeone.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403082901/http://www.policeone.com/police-products/firearms/articles/1992665-SHOT-Show-2010-GLOCK-brings-pistols-into-the-next-generation |archive-date=2010-04-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Guns Holsters and Gear |url=http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |title=Gen 4 Glock Review: Evolution, not Revolution |publisher=Gunsholstersandgear.com |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152040/http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/2010/01/19/gen-4-glock-review-evolution-not-revolution/ |archive-date=2010-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Payton Miller |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125051923/http://www.gunsandammo.com/article/glock-17-gen4 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-25 |title=Glock 17 Gen4 |publisher=gunsandammo.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of fourth-generation Glock pistols continued in July 2010 when the Glock 19 and Glock 23, the reduced size \"compact\" versions of the Glock 17 and Glock 22, became available for retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/News/2010/04/29/Glock-19-and-23-Gen4-Will-Arrive-This-Summer.aspx|title=Glock Gen4 G19 and G23 Will Arrive This Summer|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225174421/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/news/2010/04/29/glock-19-and-23-gen4-will-arrive-this-summer.aspx|archive-date=25 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In late 2010, Glock continued the introduction of fourth-generation models with the Glock 26 and Glock 27 \"subcompact\" variants.\n\nIn January 2013, more fourth-generation Glock pistols were introduced commercially during the annual SHOT Show, including the Glock 20 Generation 4 along with other fourth-generation Glock models.\n\n=====2011 recoil spring assembly exchange program=====\nIn September 2011, Glock announced a recoil spring exchange program in which the manufacturer voluntarily offers to exchange the recoil spring assemblies of its fourth-generation pistols (with the exception of the \"subcompact\" Glock 26 and Glock 27 models) sold before 22 July 2011 at no cost \"to ensure our products perform up to GLOCK\u2019s stringent standards\", according to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |title=Recoil Spring Exchange Program |publisher=Glock USA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124080900/http://www.teamglock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== M series ====\nOn 29 June 2016 the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) awarded a contract to Glock to provide new 9\u00d719mm Parabellum chambered duty pistols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|title=Glock wins $85 million FBI contract|first=Aaron|last=Smith|date=2016-06-30|access-date=2016-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195243/http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/30/news/companies/glock-gun-contract-fbi/|archive-date=2016-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The solicitation specifications deviated from the specifications of Glock fourth-generation models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=3003911f9f7ff35889bf5f46c48ba0ef&tab=core&_cview=1|title=9mm Luger Pistols / Replacement Parts -

The revisions centered on ergonomics and improving reliability. Many parts of fifth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged with those of the previous generations. The two fifth-generation models announced were the Glock 17 and Glock 19, chambered for the 9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Parabellum. Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide stop levers, nDLC ([[Diamond-like carbon|Diamond-Like Carbon]]) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring a revised style of polygonal rifling (called the \"Glock Marksman Barrel\" by Glock), a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The locking block pin located above the trigger pin that was introduced in the third generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/glock-gen5/|title=OFFICIAL: The New GLOCK Gen5 Has Arrived - The Firearm Blog|date=25 August 2017|access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234417/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/glock-gen5/|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/gen5-glock-17-19/|title=TFB FIRST LOOK: The New Gen5 GLOCK 17 And Gen5 GLOCK 19 - The Firearm Blog|date=25 August 2017|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234620/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/25/gen5-glock-17-19/|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ammoland.com/2017/08/glock-gen-5-safe-action-pistols/|title=GLOCK Gen 5 Safe Action Pistols, First Look at New GLOCK 17 & 19|date=2017-08-25|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826235744/https://www.ammoland.com/2017/08/glock-gen-5-safe-action-pistols/|archive-date=2017-08-26|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recoilweb.com/inside-the-glock-gen-5-129141.html|title=Here's the Full Reveal of the New Glock Gen5 Pistol - RECOIL|date=24 August 2017|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234305/http://www.recoilweb.com/inside-the-glock-gen-5-129141.html|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastcoating.com/products/dlc-coating|title=High Performance DLC Coatings Give You the Diamond Edge  |publisher=North East Coating Technologies |access-date=2017-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904011405/http://www.northeastcoating.com/products/dlc-coating |archive-date=2017-09-04|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Gen 5\" is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fifth-generation pistols.

During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.<ref name=\"Kokalis\">Kokalis, Peter: ''Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of Soldier of Fortune'', page 320. Paladin Press, 2001.</ref>\n\nGlock pistols incorporate a number of features intended to enhance reliability in adverse conditions, such as utilizing  advanced metal coatings, \"stub\" slide guides instead of true frame rails, and an unusual cocking mechanism wherein the trigger is partially responsible for cocking the striker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/glock-17-gen-4-review-and-dirt-test-2019.html|title=Glock 17 Gen 4 Review and Dirt Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> By relying partially on force from the shooter's trigger finger to cock the striker, a Glock effectively reduces the load on the recoil spring as the slide moves forward into battery, whereas almost all other striker-fired pistols on the market rely fully on the recoil spring to cock the striker. This design gives the recoil spring fewer tasks as the action cycles, helping to ensure that sufficient energy is available to strip a new round from the magazine and achieve full battery even when the breech, chamber, and/or magazine are heavily fouled. For these and other reasons, Glock pistols are commonly considered to be some of the most reliable striker-fired, semi-automatic handguns available, with some independent testing even showing a Glock taking a lead over a Sig Sauer P320<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guntweaks.com/p320-vs-glock-torture-test-which-is-best-2019.html|title=P320 vs Glock Torture Test|last=|first=|date=|website=GunTweaks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in a wet/dry reliability test, even though the latter was selected as the winner of the U.S. Army's [[XM17 Modular Handgun System competition|MHS]] competition.\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Glock 30-JH02.jpg|thumb|A subcompact Glock 30 field stripped to its main parts with a [[.45 ACP]] round|alt=|left]]\n\nThe slide features a spring-loaded claw [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], and the stamped [[sheet metal]] ejector is pinned to the trigger mechanism housing.<ref>Glock Armorer Manual 2012 p52</ref> Pistols after 2002 have a reshaped extractor that serves as a [[loaded chamber indicator]].

As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set|preset]] trigger mechanism, referred to as the \"[[Safe action|Safe Action]]\" trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically.\n\nThe factory-standard, two-stage trigger has a trigger travel of {{convert|12.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}, but by using a modified connector, it can be increased to {{convert|35|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} or lowered to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}. In response to a request made by American law enforcement agencies for a two-stage trigger with increased trigger pull, Glock introduced the NY1 (New York) trigger module, which features a flat spring in a plastic housing that replaces the trigger bar's standard coil spring. This trigger modification is available in two versions: NY1 and NY2 that are rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|40|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} and {{convert|32|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|50|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}}, respectively, which require about {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|30|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} of force to disengage the safeties and another {{convert|10|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|20|N|lb-f|abbr=on|1}} in the second stage to fire a shot.\n\nThe Glock's frame, magazine body, and several other components are made from a high-strength [[nylon]]-based [[polymer]] invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\">Kasler, 136</ref> This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than [[carbon steel]] and most [[Alloy steel|steel alloys]]. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, [[Corrosive substance|caustic liquids]], and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The [[Injection molding|injection-molded]] frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109\u00b0 and a nonslip, [[Stippling#Other uses|stippled]] surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/1/13/steyr-m40-a1/|title=Steyr M40-A1|website=www.shootingillustrated.com|access-date=2016-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805235909/https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2011/1/13/steyr-m40-a1/|archive-date=2016-08-05|url-status=live}}</ref> The frame houses the locking block, which is an [[investment casting]] that engages a 45\u00b0 camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.\n\nThe Glock pistol has a relatively low slide profile, which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistol more comfortable to fire by reducing [[muzzle rise]] and allows for faster aim recovery in rapid firing sequences.\nThe rectangular slide is [[Milling machine|milled]] from a single block of ordnance-grade steel using [[Numerical control|CNC]] machinery.<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\">Kokalis, 321</ref> The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary [[nitriding]] process called [[Tenifer]]. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a {{convert|500|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} nitrate bath.<ref name=\"Kasler_136\"/> The Tenifer finish is between {{convert|0.04|and|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on|4}} in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\">Kasler, 137</ref>\n\nThe Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, nonglare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds [[stainless steel]] specifications),<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\"/> making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed]] as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[Chrome plating#industrial chrome|hard chrome plating]], or phosphates.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/> During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing|gas nitriding]] process. After applying the nitriding process, a black [[Parkerized]] decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.<ref name=\"MetalTreatments\" />\n\nA current production Glock 17 consists of 34 parts.<ref name=\"us.glock.com\"/> For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, slide, frame, magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm is designed for the [[NATO]]-standard 9\u00d719mm Parabellum [[Handgun|pistol]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.\n\n=== Barrel ===\n[[File:Glock 17 9mmPara 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard sighting arrangement of a \"first-generation\" Glock 17]]\n\nThe hammer-forged barrel has a female type [[polygonal rifling]] with a right-hand twist. The stabilization of the round is not by conventional [[rifling]], using lands and grooves, but rather through a polygonal profile consisting of a series of six or eight interconnected noncircular segments (only the .45 ACP and .45 GAP have octagonal polygonal rifling). Each depressed segment within the interior of the barrel is the equivalent of a groove in a conventional barrel. Thus, the interior of the barrel consists of smooth arcs of steel rather than sharply defined slots.\n\nInstead of using a traditional [[Broaching (metalworking)|broaching machine]] to cut the rifling into the bore, the hammer forging process involves beating a slowly rotating [[mandrel]] through the bore to obtain the [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al shape.<ref name=\"Kasler_138\">Kasler, 138</ref> As a result, the barrel's thickness in the area of each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet,<ref name=\"Kasler_138\"/> slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.<ref name=\"Barrel History\">{{cite web |url=http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102209/http://atlantisarms.com/History/Barrel%20History.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |title=Barrels |publisher=AtlantisArms.com |date=2004 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe newer lines of Glock pistols - i.e. Gen5, G42/43 - are equipped with the ''Glock Marksmanship Barrel'', or GMB. While older barrels were somewhat difficult to identify a bullet as coming from a particular barrel with high enough reliability for evidentiary use, the newer GMB ones are designed differently. A recent study by Stephen Christen and Hans Rudolf Jordi, and published by ''Forensic Science International'' in February 2019, shows that the new GMB barrels leave more identifiably unique markings on the fired projectile. These marks were more easily identified than previous pistol barrel markings, and were sufficient for reliably tying a bullet to a particular barrel. The study used a comparison microscope and an ABIS (Evofinder).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Christen |first1=Stephan |last2=Jordi |first2=Hans Rudolf |title=Individuality testing of new Glock pistol barrels 'Marksman Barrel' |journal=Forensic Science International |date=February 2019 |volume=295 |pages=64\u201371 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.11.028 |pmid=30572221 }}</ref>\n\n=== Safety ===\nGlock pistols lack a traditional on-off safety lever, which Glock markets as an advantage, especially to police departments, as the user is able to fire immediately without separately manipulating a safety.<ref name=bloom-safety>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2009-09-09/glock-pistol-used-by-police-raised-safety-issues |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |last1=Barrett|first1=Paul |last2=Grow|first2=Brian  |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=2016-01-02 |date=2009-09-09}}</ref> Instead, the pistols are designed with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated \"Safe Action\" by Glock, consists of an external [[Trigger safety|integrated trigger safety]] and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety and a drop safety.<ref>{{cite web |title=Safe-action system on Glock.com |url=https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |accessdate=2016-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623235719/https://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action |archive-date=2016-06-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released.<ref name=\"Wo\u017aniak\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Paul |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |title=Glock Pistol Used by Police Raised Safety Issues |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115022230/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_38/b4147038111680.htm |archive-date=2010-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Glock announced the Internal Locking System (ILS) safety feature. The ILS is a manually activated lock located in the back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and, according to Glock, each key is unique. When activated, the lock causes a tab to protrude from the rear of the grip, giving both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable, as well as making it impossible to disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol. The ILS is available as an option on most Glock pistols. Glock pistols cannot be retrofitted to accommodate the ILS. The lock must be factory-built in Austria and shipped as a special order.\n\n=== Feeding ===\n[[File:Glock 17 magazine.JPG|thumb|upright|Glock 9\u00d719mm Parabellum 17-round magazine. The numbered witness holes at the back portion visually indicate how many cartridges are contained in the magazine.]]\nThe Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or double stack [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s that have a 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 24 or 33-round [[high-capacity magazine]]s.<ref>[http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm Glock magazines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208011649/http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm |date=December 8, 2010 }}</ref> For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever is located on the left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.\n\nGlock magazines are interchangeable between models of the same caliber, meaning that a compact or subcompact pistol will accept magazines designed for the larger pistols chambered for the same round. However, magazines designed for compact and subcompact models will not function in larger pistols because they are not tall enough to reach the slide and magazine release. For example, the subcompact Glock 26 will accept magazines from both the full-size Glock 17 and the compact Glock 19, but the Glock 17 will not accept magazines from the smaller Glock 19 or the Glock 26.  The magazines for the Glock 36, the Glock 42, the Glock 43, and the Glock 44 are all unique; they cannot use magazines intended for another model, nor can their magazines be used in other models.\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe Glock 17 has a fixed polymer combat-type [[iron sight|sighting arrangement]] that consists of a ramped front sight and a notched rear sight with white contrast elements painted on for increased acquisition speed \u2013 a white dot on the front post and a rectangular border on the rear notch. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage (on certain models due to the windage sights not coming as factory default),  as it has a degree of lateral movement in the dovetail it is mounted in. Three other factory rear sight configurations are available in addition to the standard {{convert|6.5|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} height sight: a lower impact {{convert|6.1|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on|2}} sight, and two higher impact versions \u2013 {{convert|6.9|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} and {{convert|7.3|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}.<ref name=\"Kokalis_322\">Kokalis, 322</ref>\n\n=== Accessories ===\n {{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 220\n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Glock34 with gtl22.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  = Glock 34 with a GTL 22 attachment featuring a dimmable xenon white light and a red laser\n   | image2    = D150211dv1047.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  = A military diver displaying a Glock 17 fitted with maritime spring cups (not visible in picture, these are part of the internal mechanism)\n   | image3    = GlockOrig.jpg\n   | alt23     =\n   | caption3  = Polymer holster for Glock pistols\n  }}\n\nThe Glock pistol accessories available from the factory include several devices for tactical illumination, such as a series of front rail-mounted \"Glock tactical lights\" featuring a white [[tactical light]] and an optional visible laser sight. An alternate version of the tactical light using an invisible [[infrared]] light and laser sight is available, designed to be used with an infrared [[night vision device]]. Another lighting accessory is an adapter to mount a flashlight onto the bottom of a magazine.\n\nPolymer holsters in various configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups are designed to allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.\n\nMagazine floor plates (or +2 baseplates), which expand the capacity of the standard magazines by two rounds, are available for models chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .45 GAP, [[.40 S&W]], [[.357 SIG]], and [[.380 ACP]] cartridges. In addition to the standard nonadjustable polymer sight line, three alternative sight lines are offered by Glock. These consist of steel, adjustable, and self-illuminating [[Tritium sights|tritium]] night rear sights and factory steel and self-illuminating tritium contrast pointer steel front sights.\n\n== Variants ==\nFollowing the introduction of the Glock 17, numerous variants and versions have been offered. Variants that differ in caliber, frame, and slide length are identified by different model numbers with the exception of the Glock 17L.\n\nGlock pistols are made in five form factors, all modeled after the original full-sized Glock 17. \"Standard\" models are designed as full-sized duty firearms with a large magazine capacity. \"Compact\" models are slightly smaller with reduced magazine capacity and lighter weight while maintaining a usable grip length. \"[[Subcompact pistols|Subcompact]]\" models are designed for easier carry and being lighter and shorter, are intended to be used with two fingers on the grip below the trigger guard and lack an accessory rail like the larger, after generation two, Glock models. The .45 ACP and [[10mm Auto]] models have bigger, wider slides and are slightly larger than the smaller-chambered pistols and are available in the subcompact models Glock 29 (10 mm) and Glock 30 (.45 ACP). Glock produces five models of single-stack \"Slimline\" subcompact pistols, the Glock 36 in .45 ACP, the Glock 42 in .380 ACP, and the Glock 43, 43x, and 48 in 9\u00d719mm. The 43x and the 48 have longer grips that allow for a full three-finger hold and a 10-round capacity. \"Competition\" versions have longer barrels and slides, adjustable sights, an extended slide and magazine release.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Glock introduced several \"Short Frame\" models designated by the suffix \"SF\". The short frame was originally designed to compete in the now cancelled U.S. military [[Joint Combat Pistol]] trials for a new .45 ACP pistol to replace the [[M9 pistol]]. Glock's entry featured an optional ambidextrous magazine release and [[Picatinny rail|MIL-STD-1913]] rail along with a reduction in the size of the backstrap. The Glock 21SF is currently available in three versions: one with a Picatinny rail and ambidextrous magazine release and two with a Universal Glock rail available with or without the ambidextrous magazine release. Current 10mm and .45 ACP Glock magazines are manufactured with ambidextrous magazine release cutouts. As of January 2009, the Glock 20, 21, 29, and 30 were offered in short-framed variations. These models incorporate a {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} reduction in trigger reach, and full-sized models feature a {{convert|4|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} reduction in heel depth, which corresponds to an overall reduction in length for those models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |title=Reuters announcement for Glock models |accessdate=2017-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416220902/http://www.gunholstersandmore.com/glock-17-holsters/ |archive-date=2017-04-16 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ibtimes.com/prnews/20080202/ga-glock-30-sf-45.htm \"Glock, Inc.

Several modified versions of the Glock 17 have been introduced:\n** '''Glock 17L''': Introduced in 1988, the 17L incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three holes in the top of the barrel and a corresponding slot in the slide; however, later production pistols lack the holes in the barrel. The Glock 17L is manufactured in limited quantities.\n** '''Glock 17C''': Introduced in 1996, the 17C incorporates slots cut in the barrel and slide to [[Muzzle brake|compensate for recoil]]. Many other Glock pistols now come with this option, all with a \"C\" suffix on the slide.\n** '''Glock 17MB''': The 17MB is a version with ambidextrous magazine catch. This model, along with the other MB variants, was no longer available upon the introduction of the fourth-generation models, which have a reversible magazine catch.\n** '''Glock 17M''': Introduced in 2016, the 17M was created in response to an FBI solicitation for a new 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous slide lock, rounded slide nose profile, flared magazine well with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Handgun Planet (staff) |date=March 30, 2017 |title=Glock 17M: The 'Inside' Scoop (Photo Documentary) |url=https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |publisher=Handgun Planet |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711064050/https://handgunplanet.com/review/glock-17m-the-inside-scoop-photo-documentary/ |archive-date=July 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[South Carolina Highway Patrol]] and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]<ref name=\"glock.com\">{{cite press release |title=Ontario Provincial Police Replaces its Current Pistols with GLOCK Pistols |url=https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |date=June 12, 2017 |publisher=U.S. Headquarters, GLOCK |access-date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730080551/https://us.glock.com/press%20release/pages/ontario%20provincial%20police%20replaces%20its%20current%20pistols%20with%20glock%20pistols |archive-date=July 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> have adopted the pistol as standard.\n\n[[File:MarineCorpsGlock18.jpg|thumb|The Glock 18, chambered in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, fitted with a detachable shoulder stock and being fired in fully automatic mode]]\n[[File:Glock 18C.jpg|thumb|Glock 18C (compensated) in the third generation, unloaded and equipped with 19-rounds magazine, fire selector set to single fire]]\n\n* '''Glock 18''': The Glock 18{{Anchor|Glock 18}} is a [[selective fire|selective-fire]] variant of the Glock 17, developed at the request of the Austrian [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] unit [[EKO Cobra]], and as a way to internally test Glock components under high strain conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |title=TFB TV Glock 18 Machine Pistol Mini-Documentary |publisher=The Firearm Blog |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012043620/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/08/17/tfb-tv-glock-18-machine-pistol-mini-documentary/ |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally produced in 1986, this [[machine pistol]]\u2013class firearm has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the serrated portion of the rear left side of the slide. With the selector lever in the bottom position, the pistol fires [[Automatic firearm|fully automatically]], and with the selector lever in the top position, the pistol fires semi-automatically. The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round-capacity magazine, although other magazines from the Glock 17 can be used, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19 or 24 rounds. Unlike all its other pistols, Glock is highly secretive about Glock 18 models, not including them on its official websites or its public catalogues,<ref name=\"guns.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|title=Hands-on with Glock 18: The elusive machine pistol (VIDEO)|date=7 August 2017|publisher=Guns.com|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011232935/http://www.guns.com/2017/08/07/glock-18-the-machine-pistol/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and because of the pistol's nature, it is only offered to military, law enforcement, and government organizations,<ref name=\"guns.com\"/> and its production details are highly classified. Early Glock 18 models were ported to reduce [[muzzle rise]] during automatic fire. A very early design introduced a longer ported barrel which was soon discarded as it would not fit in a holster. Another compensated variant was produced, known as the Glock 18C. It has a keyhole opening cut into the forward portion of the slide, similar to the opening on the Glock long-slide models, although the Glock 18 has a standard-length slide. The keyhole opening provides an area to allow the four, progressively larger (from back to front) compensator cuts machined into the barrel to vent the propellant gases upwards, affording more control over the rapid-firing machine pistol.\n** '''Glock 18C''': The compensator cuts start about halfway back on the top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100\u20131,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the slide, frame, and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html Janes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213084320/http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jiw/jiw_0006.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |title=Glock 18 interchangeability with Glock 17 |publisher=Cybershooters.org |accessdate=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091944/https://www.cybershooters.org/?page_id=528 |archive-date=2015-06-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:GLOCK 19.JPG|thumb|The compact Glock 19 in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]\n* '''Glock 19''': The Glock 19 {{Anchor|Glock 19}} is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the \"Compact\" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} than the Glock 17, and it uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), 24 and 26 (standard magazine with +2 extension) and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19.

It features a Glock 19 slide with a Glock 17 frame in coyote color instead of the regular black color the Glock usually comes in. The frame includes a lanyard loop and a front lip in the magazine which purpose is to make changing magazines with gloves on easier, but this means the new Gen 5 17-round magazines cannot be used in the Glock 19X because the front lip will block the extended magazine floor plates from locking into the 19X's magazine well.

It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 24, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a \"shortened\" Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring.\n* '''Glock 34''': The Glock 34 {{Anchor|Glock 34}} is a competition version of the Glock 17. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. It was developed and produced in 1998, and compared to the Glock 17, features a {{convert|21|mm|abbr=on|1}} longer barrel and slide. It has an extended magazine release, extended slide stop lever, {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull, and an adjustable rear sight. The sides at the front of the slide are slanted instead of squared. Further, the top of the slide and parts of its inside are milled out, creating a conspicuous hole at the top designed to reduce front-end muzzle weight to better balance the pistol and reduce the overall weight of the slide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |url=http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |title=The Glock 34 |work=[[Guns (magazine)|Guns]] |date=September 1999 |publisher=The Modern Survivalist |access-date=March 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182714/http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/archives/81 |archive-date=March 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* '''Glock 43''': The Glock 43{{Anchor|Glock 43}} is a \"slimline\" version of the subcompact Glock 26 that features an ultracompact slide and frame.

The Glock 36 is the first Glock pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack magazine, having a standard capacity of six rounds and being unique to the model. The Glock 36 cannot use factory magazines from its larger relatives due to its single-stack magazine design.\n* '''Glock 41''': The Glock 41 {{Anchor|Glock 41}} is a competition version of the Glock 21, much like what the G34 is in relation to the G17; it features a 5.3-inch barrel and an elongated slide.

The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge. The standard magazine capacity is 15 rounds. The Glock Model 22 is favored and used by multiple law enforcement agencies around the world, including the [[Baltimore Police Department]], [[Los Angeles Police Department]], [[Miami Police Department]], [[Maryland State Police]], [[Overland Park Police Department]], [[Kansas City Police Department]], [[Missouri State Highway Patrol]], and [[Alaska State Troopers]] in the United States; the [[New South Wales Police Force#Firearms|NSW Police Force]] and [[Queensland Police Service#Equipment|Queensland Police Service]] in Australia; the [[Edmonton Police Service]], [[Calgary Police Service]], [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], [[Toronto Police Service]], [[Ottawa Police Service]], and [[British Columbia Sheriff Service]] in Canada; and the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)]], among others.\n* '''Glock 23''': The Glock 23 {{Anchor|Glock 23}} is a .40 S&W version of the compact Glock 19. It is dimensionally identical to the Glock 19, but is slightly heavier and uses a modified slide, frame, .40 S&W barrel, and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds.

The factory magazines from the larger Glock 22 and 23 will function in the Glock 27, increasing capacity to 13 or 15 rounds.  Spacers are available that fit on these larger-capacity magazines themselves; they have the effect of \"extending\" the magazine well of the pistol, thereby improving the ergonomic feel of the pistol when the longer magazines are inserted.\n* '''Glock 35''': The Glock 35 {{Anchor|Glock 35}} is a .40 S&W version of the competition Glock 34. The Glock Model 35 was the service pistol for the [[Kentucky State Police]], but by the summer of 2017, they had reverted from the Glock 35 back to 9mm weapons because of improvements in 9mm bullets, making them superior to the Glock 35's .40 ammunition in performance and economy as measured in the standard \"FBI Protocol\" tests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klemagazine.com/home/2017/7/25/better-bullets|title=Better Bullets|last=Moore|first=Michael|date=July 2017|website=Kentucky Law Enforcement Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061606/https://www.klemagazine.com/home/2017/7/25/better-bullets|archive-date=2018-10-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs is typical of pistols chambered in .40 S&W, each of the standard Glock models (22, 23, and 27) may be easily converted to the corresponding [[.357 SIG]] chambering (Glock 31, 32, and 33, respectively) simply by replacing the barrel.

It operates via [[Blowback (arms)|straight blowback]] of the slide. This required modification of the locking surfaces on the barrel, as well as a redesign of the former locking block.  Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame.  It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system.  The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 required return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design.\n* '''Glock 25''': The Glock 25 {{Anchor|Glock 25}}, introduced in 1995, is a blowback derivative of the compact ({{convert|102|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel) Glock 19.

The standard magazine capacity is 10 rounds, but the 15-round Glock 25 magazine will function in the Glock 28.  Standard fixed-sight elevation is 6.9&nbsp;mm, unlike the 6.5&nbsp;mm elevation used for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum models.\n* '''Glock 42''': The Glock 42 {{Anchor|Glock 42}}, introduced in 2014, is an all-new locked-breech \"slimline\" ({{convert|83|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel) design. The single-stack magazine is unique to this model, with a capacity of six rounds.

It uses a wider, beveled slide, larger barrel, and different magazine, but is otherwise similar to the Glock 17. The Glock 37 first appeared in 2003. It was designed to offer ballistic performance comparable with the .45 ACP in the frame size of the Glock 17. The concern with the size of the Glock 20/21 has been addressed by the Glock 36, 21SF, and 30SF, all of which featured reduced-size frames.

The tale was first published by [[Giambattista Basile]] in his collection of tales titled [[Pentamerone| ''The Pentamerone'']] (published posthumously in 1634).<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hallett |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Karasek |editor2-first=Barbara |title=Folk & Fairy Tales |date=2009 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=978-1-55111-898-7 |pages=63\u201367 |edition=4}}</ref> Basile's version was later adapted and published by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]'' in 1697. The version that was later collected and printed by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was an orally transmitted version of the literary tale published by Perrault.<ref>Bottigheimer, Ruth. (2008). \"Before ''Contes du temps passe'' (1697): Charles Perrault's ''Griselidis'', ''Souhaits'' and ''Peau''\". ''The Romantic Review'', Volume 99, Number 3. pp. 175\u2013189.</ref> \n\nThe [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems|Aarne-Thompson classification system]] for folktales classifies Sleeping Beauty as being a 410 tale type, meaning it includes a princess who is [[Incantation|forced]] into an enchanted sleep and is later awakened reversing the magic placed upon her. The story has been adapted many times throughout history and has continued to be retold by modern storytellers throughout various media.\n\n==Origination==\nEarly contributions to the tale include the medieval courtly romance ''[[Perceforest]]'' (published in 1528). In this tale, a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her and impregnates her in her sleep; when their child is born, the child draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring Troylus left her that he was the father, and Troylus later returns to marry her.<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 648, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\nThe second part of the Sleeping Beauty tale, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death but instead are hidden, may have been influenced by [[Genevieve of Brabant]].<ref name=\"Genevieve of Brabant\">Charles Willing, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Genevieve_of_Brabant.html?id=4Ac6qAAACAAJ \"Genevieve of Brabant\"]</ref> Even earlier influences come from the story of the sleeping [[Brynhild]] in the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian [[hagiography]] conventions. Following these early renditions, the tale was first published by Italian poet Giambattista Basile who lived from 1575\u20131632.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Image:Ring34.jpg|175 px|thumb|An older image of the sleeping princess: [[Br\u00fcnnhilde]], surrounded by magical fire rather than roses (illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'')]]\nThe [[folklore|folktale]] begins with a princess whose parents are told by a wicked fairy that their daughter will die when she pricks her finger on a particular item. In Basile's version, the princess pricks her finger on a piece of [[flax]]. In Perrault's and the Grimm Brothers' versions, the item is a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. The parents rid the kingdom of these items in the hopes of protecting their daughter, but the prophecy is fulfilled regardless. Instead of dying, as was foretold, the princess falls into a deep sleep. After some time, she is found by a prince and is awakened. In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleeping beauty, Talia, falls into a deep sleep after getting a splinter of flax in her finger. When she is discovered in her castle by a wandering king, he \"...gathers the first fruits of love.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Giambattista|title=Sun, Moon, and Talia|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> and leaves her there where she later gives birth to a set of twins.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collis |first1=Kathryn |title=Not So Grimm Fairy Tales |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-5144-4689-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6aLJCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT82&lpg=PT82&dq=talabutte#v=onepage&q=sleeping%20beauty&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maria Tatar, there are versions of the story that include a second part to the narrative that details the couple's troubles after their union; some folklorists believe the two parts were originally separate tales.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', 2002:96, {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\nThe second part begins after the prince and princess have had children. Through the course of the tale, the princess and her children are introduced in some way to another woman from the prince's life. This other woman is not fond of the prince's new family, and calls a cook to kill the children and serve them for dinner. Instead of obeying, the cook hides the children and serves livestock. Next, the other woman orders the cook to kill the princess. Before this can happen, the other woman's true nature is revealed to the prince and then she is subjected to the very death that she had planned for the princess. The princess, prince, and their children live happily ever after.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ashliman |first1=D.L. |title=Sleeping Beauty |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile |website=pitt.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Perrault's narrative===\n[[Image:Dornr\u00f6schen.jpg|thumb|left|Sleeping Beauty is shown a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] by the old woman. ''Sleeping Beauty'', by [[Alexander Zick]] (1845\u20131907)]]\nPerrault's narrative is written in two parts, which some folklorists believe were originally separate tales, as they were in the Brothers Grimm's version, and were later joined together by Giambattista Basile and once more by Perrault.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', 2002:96, {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref> According to folklore editors Martin Hallett and Barbara Karasek, Perrault's tale is a much more subtle and pared down version than Basile's story in terms of the more immoral details. An example of this is depicted in Perrault's tale by the prince's choice to instigate no physical interaction with the sleeping princess when the prince discovers her.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hallett |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Karasek |editor2-first=Barbara |title=Folk & Fairy Tales |date=2009 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=978-1-55111-898-7 |pages=63\u201367 |edition=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Baptism|christening]] of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven good [[Fairy|fairies]] are invited to be [[Godparent|godmothers]] to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old [[Wicked fairy godmother|fairy]] enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass. This old fairy is overlooked because she has been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess. The evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn't yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy's curse. However, she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a kiss from a king's son. This is her gift of protection.\n\nThe King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed, to try to save his daughter from the terrible curse. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. The princess, who has never seen anyone spin before, asks the old woman if she can try the spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled as the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The king and queen kiss their daughter goodbye and depart, proclaiming the entrance to be forbidden. The good fairy who altered the evil prophecy is summoned. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. The fairy also summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns that spring up around the castle, shielding it from the outside world and preventing anyone from disturbing the Princess.\n\nA hundred years pass and a prince from another family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father's words: within the castle lies a beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king's son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The enchantment comes to an end by a kiss and the princess awakens and converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the rest of the castle awakens and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.\n\nAfter wedding the Princess in secret, the Prince continues to visit her and she bears him two children, Aurore (Dawn) and Jour (Day), unbeknown to his mother, who is of an [[ogre]] lineage. When the time comes for the Prince to ascend the throne, he brings his wife, children, and the talabutte (\"Count of the Mount\").\n\nThe Ogress Queen Mother sends the young Queen and the children to a house secluded in the woods and directs her cook to prepare the boy with  ''[[Sauce Robert]]'' for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the boy, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands the girl but the cook this time substitutes a young goat, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the young Queen, the latter offers to slit her throat so that she may join the children that she imagines are dead. While the Queen Mother is satisfied with a [[red deer|hind]] prepared with ''Sauce Robert'' in place of the young Queen, there is a tearful secret reunion of the Queen and her children. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cook's trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns in the nick of time and the Ogress, her true nature having been  exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.\n\n===Grimm Brothers' version===\n[[Image: Sleeping beauty by Edward Burne-Jones.jpg|270px|thumb|Sleeping Beauty and the palace dwellers under a century-long sleep enchantment (''The Sleeping Beauty'' by Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]]).]]\nThe Brothers Grimm included a variant of Sleeping Beauty, ''Little Briar Rose'', in their collection (1812).<ref name=\"Little Briar-Rose\"/> Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty (named Rosamund) and does not include the part two as found in Basile's and Perrault's versions.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie on German Folklore\", p 961, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault's version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Their decision was notable because in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and [[Prose Edda|Prose Eddas]] or [[Volsunga Saga]], are their sleepers awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would have known since he wrote an encyclopedic volume on [[German mythology]]. His version is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault's influence is almost certain.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie on German Folklore\", p 962, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\nThe Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, \"The Evil Mother-in-law\". This story begins with the heroine, a married mother of two children, and her mother-in-law who attempts to eat her and the children. The heroine suggests an animal be substituted in the dish, and the story ends with the heroine's worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-law's attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 376-7 W. W.

By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father who is a great lord learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. The splinter later causes what appears to be Talia's death; however, it is later learned that it is a long, deep sleep. After Talia falls into deep sleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and \"...gathers the first fruits of love.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Sleeping Beauty|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html}}</ref> Afterwards, he leaves her in the bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twins \u2014 one of whom keeps sucking her fingers. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm, but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.\n\nWhen he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying \"Talia, Sun, and Moon\" in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king's secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the \"king\" and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, \"Eat, eat, you are eating of your own.\" Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out what's going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Giambattista|title=Sun, Moon, and Talia|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Variations===\n[[Image:Walter Crane12.jpg|170px|thumb|''He stands\u2014he stoops to gaze\u2014he kneels\u2014he wakes her with a kiss'', woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]\n{{Redirect|Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|the Disney variation of the character|Aurora (Disney)}}\nThe princess's name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault's story but her daughter is called  \"Aurore\". The Brothers Grimm named her \"Briar Rose\" in their 1812 collection.<ref name=\"Little Briar-Rose\">Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html \"Little Briar-Rose\"]</ref> However, some translations of the Grimms' tale give the princess the name \"Rosamond\". Tchaikovsky's ballet and Disney's version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called \"Briar Rose\" in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/notes.html#FORTY4 The Annotated Sleeping Beauty]\"</ref> John Stejean named her \"Rosebud\" in TeleStory Presents.\n\nBesides ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, ''[[The Young Slave]]'', in his book, ''The Pentamerone''. The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one titled ''[[The Glass Coffin]]''.<ref name=\"Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty\">Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/other.html \"Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty\"]</ref>\n\n[[Italo Calvino]] included a variant in ''[[Italian Folktales]]''. In his version, the cause of the princess's sleep is a [[wish]] by her mother. As in ''[[Pentamerone]]'', the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. Calvino retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king's mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, and instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile's.<ref>Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 485 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}</ref><ref>Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 744 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}</ref>\nIn his ''More English Fairy Tales,'' [[Joseph Jacobs]] noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Gypsy tale ''[[The King of England and his Three Sons]]''.<ref>Joseph Jacobs, ''More English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreenglish/kingengland.html \"The King of England and his Three Sons\"]</ref>\n\nThe hostility of the king's mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'',<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 230 W.

In desperation to save his daughter, the king tries everything he can to protect his daughter from this fate. However, since this prophecy is foretold, it finds a way to become true. This idea of prophecy is found in other Greek myths, like the story of Oedipus. \u201cWhether recounting the distant past or rapidly evolving in the present, ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus the King]]'' remains a tragedy of belief, even as the conditions of that belief change over time.

The story has been adapted many times throughout history and has continued to be retold by modern storytellers throughout various media.\n\n==Origination==\nEarly contributions to the tale include the medieval courtly romance ''[[Perceforest]]'' (published in 1528). In this tale, a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her and impregnates her in her sleep; when their child is born, the child draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring Troylus left her that he was the father, and Troylus later returns to marry her.<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 648, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\nThe second part of the Sleeping Beauty tale, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death but instead are hidden, may have been influenced by [[Genevieve of Brabant]].<ref name=\"Genevieve of Brabant\">Charles Willing, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Genevieve_of_Brabant.html?id=4Ac6qAAACAAJ \"Genevieve of Brabant\"]</ref> Even earlier influences come from the story of the sleeping [[Brynhild]] in the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian [[hagiography]] conventions. Following these early renditions, the tale was first published by Italian poet Giambattista Basile who lived from 1575\u20131632.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Image:Ring34.jpg|175 px|thumb|An older image of the sleeping princess: [[Br\u00fcnnhilde]], surrounded by magical fire rather than roses (illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'')]]\nThe [[folklore|folktale]] begins with a princess whose parents are told by a wicked fairy that their daughter will die when she pricks her finger on a particular item. In Basile's version, the princess pricks her finger on a piece of [[flax]]. In Perrault's and the Grimm Brothers' versions, the item is a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. The parents rid the kingdom of these items in the hopes of protecting their daughter, but the prophecy is fulfilled regardless. Instead of dying, as was foretold, the princess falls into a deep sleep. After some time, she is found by a prince and is awakened. In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleeping beauty, Talia, falls into a deep sleep after getting a splinter of flax in her finger. When she is discovered in her castle by a wandering king, he \"...gathers the first fruits of love.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Giambattista|title=Sun, Moon, and Talia|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref> and leaves her there where she later gives birth to a set of twins.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collis |first1=Kathryn |title=Not So Grimm Fairy Tales |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-5144-4689-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6aLJCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT82&lpg=PT82&dq=talabutte#v=onepage&q=sleeping%20beauty&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maria Tatar, there are versions of the story that include a second part to the narrative that details the couple's troubles after their union; some folklorists believe the two parts were originally separate tales.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', 2002:96, {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\nThe second part begins after the prince and princess have had children. Through the course of the tale, the princess and her children are introduced in some way to another woman from the prince's life. This other woman is not fond of the prince's new family, and calls a cook to kill the children and serve them for dinner. Instead of obeying, the cook hides the children and serves livestock. Next, the other woman orders the cook to kill the princess. Before this can happen, the other woman's true nature is revealed to the prince and then she is subjected to the very death that she had planned for the princess. The princess, prince, and their children live happily ever after.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ashliman |first1=D.L. |title=Sleeping Beauty |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile |website=pitt.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Perrault's narrative===\n[[Image:Dornr\u00f6schen.jpg|thumb|left|Sleeping Beauty is shown a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] by the old woman.

An example of this is depicted in Perrault's tale by the prince's choice to instigate no physical interaction with the sleeping princess when the prince discovers her.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hallett |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Karasek |editor2-first=Barbara |title=Folk & Fairy Tales |date=2009 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=978-1-55111-898-7 |pages=63\u201367 |edition=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Baptism|christening]] of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven good [[Fairy|fairies]] are invited to be [[Godparent|godmothers]] to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old [[Wicked fairy godmother|fairy]] enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass. This old fairy is overlooked because she has been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess. The evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn't yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy's curse. However, she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a kiss from a king's son. This is her gift of protection.\n\nThe King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed, to try to save his daughter from the terrible curse. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. The princess, who has never seen anyone spin before, asks the old woman if she can try the spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled as the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The king and queen kiss their daughter goodbye and depart, proclaiming the entrance to be forbidden. The good fairy who altered the evil prophecy is summoned. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. The fairy also summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns that spring up around the castle, shielding it from the outside world and preventing anyone from disturbing the Princess.\n\nA hundred years pass and a prince from another family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father's words: within the castle lies a beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king's son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The enchantment comes to an end by a kiss and the princess awakens and converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the rest of the castle awakens and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.\n\nAfter wedding the Princess in secret, the Prince continues to visit her and she bears him two children, Aurore (Dawn) and Jour (Day), unbeknown to his mother, who is of an [[ogre]] lineage. When the time comes for the Prince to ascend the throne, he brings his wife, children, and the talabutte (\"Count of the Mount\").\n\nThe Ogress Queen Mother sends the young Queen and the children to a house secluded in the woods and directs her cook to prepare the boy with  ''[[Sauce Robert]]'' for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the boy, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands the girl but the cook this time substitutes a young goat, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the young Queen, the latter offers to slit her throat so that she may join the children that she imagines are dead. While the Queen Mother is satisfied with a [[red deer|hind]] prepared with ''Sauce Robert'' in place of the young Queen, there is a tearful secret reunion of the Queen and her children. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cook's trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns in the nick of time and the Ogress, her true nature having been  exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.\n\n===Grimm Brothers' version===\n[[Image: Sleeping beauty by Edward Burne-Jones.jpg|270px|thumb|Sleeping Beauty and the palace dwellers under a century-long sleep enchantment (''The Sleeping Beauty'' by Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]]).]]\nThe Brothers Grimm included a variant of Sleeping Beauty, ''Little Briar Rose'', in their collection (1812).<ref name=\"Little Briar-Rose\"/> Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty (named Rosamund) and does not include the part two as found in Basile's and Perrault's versions.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie on German Folklore\", p 961, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault's version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Their decision was notable because in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and [[Prose Edda|Prose Eddas]] or [[Volsunga Saga]], are their sleepers awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would have known since he wrote an encyclopedic volume on [[German mythology]]. His version is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault's influence is almost certain.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie on German Folklore\", p 962, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\nThe Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, \"The Evil Mother-in-law\". This story begins with the heroine, a married mother of two children, and her mother-in-law who attempts to eat her and the children. The heroine suggests an animal be substituted in the dish, and the story ends with the heroine's worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-law's attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 376-7 W. W.

By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father who is a great lord learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. The splinter later causes what appears to be Talia's death; however, it is later learned that it is a long, deep sleep. After Talia falls into deep sleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and \"...gathers the first fruits of love.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Sleeping Beauty|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html}}</ref> Afterwards, he leaves her in the bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twins \u2014 one of whom keeps sucking her fingers. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm, but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.\n\nWhen he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying \"Talia, Sun, and Moon\" in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king's secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the \"king\" and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, \"Eat, eat, you are eating of your own.\" Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out what's going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Giambattista|title=Sun, Moon, and Talia|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Variations===\n[[Image:Walter Crane12.jpg|170px|thumb|''He stands\u2014he stoops to gaze\u2014he kneels\u2014he wakes her with a kiss'', woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]\n{{Redirect|Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|the Disney variation of the character|Aurora (Disney)}}\nThe princess's name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault's story but her daughter is called  \"Aurore\". The Brothers Grimm named her \"Briar Rose\" in their 1812 collection.<ref name=\"Little Briar-Rose\">Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html \"Little Briar-Rose\"]</ref> However, some translations of the Grimms' tale give the princess the name \"Rosamond\". Tchaikovsky's ballet and Disney's version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called \"Briar Rose\" in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/notes.html#FORTY4 The Annotated Sleeping Beauty]\"</ref> John Stejean named her \"Rosebud\" in TeleStory Presents.\n\nBesides ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, ''[[The Young Slave]]'', in his book, ''The Pentamerone''. The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one titled ''[[The Glass Coffin]]''.<ref name=\"Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty\">Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/other.html \"Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty\"]</ref>\n\n[[Italo Calvino]] included a variant in ''[[Italian Folktales]]''. In his version, the cause of the princess's sleep is a [[wish]] by her mother. As in ''[[Pentamerone]]'', the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. Calvino retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king's mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, and instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile's.<ref>Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 485 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}</ref><ref>Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 744 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}</ref>\nIn his ''More English Fairy Tales,'' [[Joseph Jacobs]] noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Gypsy tale ''[[The King of England and his Three Sons]]''.<ref>Joseph Jacobs, ''More English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreenglish/kingengland.html \"The King of England and his Three Sons\"]</ref>\n\nThe hostility of the king's mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'',<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 230 W.

In desperation to save his daughter, the king tries everything he can to protect his daughter from this fate. However, since this prophecy is foretold, it finds a way to become true. This idea of prophecy is found in other Greek myths, like the story of Oedipus. \u201cWhether recounting the distant past or rapidly evolving in the present, ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus the King]]'' remains a tragedy of belief, even as the conditions of that belief change over time.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

By the [[Late Middle Ages]], the rank had become associated with the ideals of [[chivalry]], a [[code of conduct]] for the perfect [[Court (royal)|courtly]] Christian warrior.

Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with [[horsemanship]] (and especially the [[joust]]) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the [[high nobility]] in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of ''chivalry'', ''cavalier'' and related terms. In that sense, the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in [[Christendom]] finds a parallel in the ''[[furusiyya]]'' in the [[Islamic world]].\n\nIn the [[Late Medieval period]], [[military history|new methods of warfare]] began to render classical knights in armour obsolete. Yet, the titles remained in many countries. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in [[medieval literature]], particularly the literary cycles known as the [[Matter of France]], relating to the legendary companions of [[Charlemagne]] and his [[men-at-arms]], the [[paladins]], and the [[Matter of Britain]], relating to the legend of [[King Arthur]] and his [[knights of the Round Table|knights]] of the [[Round Table]].\n\nToday, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in [[Christian denomination|Christian Churches]], as well as in several historically [[Christian countries]] and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], the Protestant [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of Saint John]], as well as the English [[Order of the Garter]], the Swedish [[Royal Order of the Seraphim]], and the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]]. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a [[head of state]], [[monarch]], or [[prelate]] to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the [[British honours system]], often for service to the Church or country. The modern female equivalent in [[English language|English]] is [[Dame]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''knight'', from [[Old English]] ''cniht'' (\"boy\" or \"servant\"),<ref name=\"Etymo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=k&p=3 |title=Knight |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> is a [[cognate]] of the [[German language|German]] word ''Knecht'' (\"servant, bondsman, vassal\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=KO6ek.&search=Knecht |title=Knecht |work=LEO German-English dictionary |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> This meaning, of unknown origin, is common among [[West Germanic languages]] (cf [[Old Frisian]] ''kniucht'', Dutch ''knecht'', Danish ''kn\u00e6gt'', Swedish ''knekt'', Norwegian ''knekt'', [[Middle High German]] ''kneht'', all meaning \"boy, youth, lad\").<ref name=\"Etymo\" /> [[Middle High German]] had the phrase ''guoter kneht'', which also meant knight; but this meaning was in decline by about 1200.<ref>William Henry Jackson. \"Aspects of Knighthood in Hartmann's Adaptations of Chretien's Romances and in the Social Context.\" In ''Chretien de Troyes and the German Middle Ages: Papers from an International Symposium'', ed.

Brewer, 1993. 37\u201355.</ref>\n\nThe meaning of ''cniht'' changed over time from its original meaning of \"boy\" to \"household [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]]\". [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham|\u00c6lfric]]'s homily of St. [[Swithun]] describes a mounted retainer as a ''cniht''. While ''cnihtas'' might have fought alongside their lords, their role as household servants features more prominently in the Anglo-Saxon texts. In several Anglo-Saxon wills ''cnihtas'' are left either money or lands. In his will, King [[\u00c6thelstan]] leaves his cniht, Aelfmar, eight [[Hide (unit)|hides]] of land.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Combined Books| last = Coss| first = Peter R| title = The knight in medieval England, 1000-1400| location = Conshohocken, PA| accessdate = 2017-06-18| date = 1996| url = http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/34564952.html}}{{subscription|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>\n\nA ''r\u0101dcniht'', \"riding-servant\", was a servant on horseback.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark Hall |first1=John R. |title=A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |date=1916 |publisher=Macmillan Company |page=238 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31543/31543-h/files/dict_os.html |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nA narrowing of the generic meaning \"servant\" to \"military follower of a king or other superior\" is visible by 1100.

The period of chaos in the 9th and 10th centuries, between the fall of the Carolingian central authority and the rise of separate Western and Eastern Frankish kingdoms (later to become [[France]] and [[Germany]] respectively) only entrenched this newly landed warrior class.

Although any medieval knight going to war would automatically serve as a man-at-arms, not all men-at-arms were knights. The first military orders of knighthood were the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Knights of the Holy Sepulchre]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]], both founded shortly after the [[First Crusade]] of 1099, followed by the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]] (1100), [[Knights Templar]]s (1118) and the [[Teutonic Knights]] (1190). At the time of their foundation, these were intended as [[monastic order]]s, whose members would act as simple soldiers protecting pilgrims.

When knights were taken as prisoners of war, they were customarily held for ransom in somewhat comfortable surroundings. This same standard of conduct did not apply to non-knights (archers, peasants, foot-soldiers, etc.) who were often slaughtered after capture, and who were viewed during battle as mere impediments to knights' getting to other knights to fight them.<ref>See Marcia L. Colish, ''The Mirror of Language: A Study in the Medieval Theory of Knowledge''; University of Nebraska Press, 1983. p. 105.</ref>\n\nChivalry developed as an early standard of [[professional ethics]] for knights, who were relatively affluent horse owners and were expected to provide military services in exchange for [[landed property]]. Early notions of chivalry entailed loyalty to one's [[Homage (feudal)|liege lord]] and bravery in battle, similar to the values of the [[Germanic Heroic Age|Heroic Age]]. During the Middle Ages, this grew from simple military professionalism into a social code including the values of gentility, nobility and treating others reasonably.<ref>Keen, Maurice Keen. Chivalry.

[[Ramon Llull]]'s ''Book of the Order of Chivalry'' (1275) demonstrates that by the end of the 13th century, chivalry entailed a litany of very specific duties, including riding warhorses, [[jousting]], attending [[tournament (medieval)|tournament]]s, holding [[Round Table]]s and hunting, as well as aspiring to the more \u00e6thereal virtues of \"faith, hope, charity, justice, strength, moderation and loyalty.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INmdwCSkvIgC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false |last1=Fritze |first1=Ronald |last2=Robison |first2=William, eds. |year=2002 |title=Historical Dictionary of Late Medieval England: 1272\u20131485 |location=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood Press |page=105|isbn=9780313291241 }}</ref>\n\nKnights of the late medieval era were expected by society to maintain all these skills and many more, as outlined in [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', though the book's protagonist, Count Ludovico, states the \"first and true profession\" of the ideal [[courtier]] \"must be that of arms.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url= |last1=Deats |first1=Sarah |last2=Logan |first2=Robert |year=2002 |title=Marlowe's Empery: Expanding His Critical Contexts |location=Cranbury, NJ |publisher=Rosemont Publishing & Printing\u2013Associated University Presses |page=137}}</ref> ''Chivalry'', derived from the French word ''chevalier'' ('cavalier'), simultaneously denoted skilled horsemanship and military service, and these remained the primary occupations of knighthood throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nChivalry and religion were mutually influenced during the period of the [[Crusades]]. The early Crusades helped to clarify the moral code of chivalry as it related to religion. As a result, Christian armies began to devote their efforts to sacred purposes.

Medieval tournaments were made up of martial sports called ''[[hastilude]]s'', and were not only a major spectator sport but also played as a real combat simulation. It usually ended with many knights either injured or even killed. One contest was a free-for-all battle called a ''[[Melee (tournament)|melee]]'', where large groups of knights numbering hundreds assembled and fought one another, and the last knight standing was the winner. The most popular and romanticized contest for knights was the ''[[joust]]''. In this competition, two knights charge each other with blunt wooden lances in an effort to break their lance on the opponent's head or body or unhorse them completely. The loser in these tournaments had to turn his armour and horse over to the victor. The last day was filled with feasting, dancing and [[minstrel]] singing.\n\nBesides formal tournaments, they were also unformalized [[judicial duels]] done by knights and squires to end various disputes.<ref name=\"Dav\">David Levinson and Karen Christensen.

Judicial combat was of two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.<ref name=\"Dav\"/> The feat of arms were done to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The chivalric combat was fought when one party's [[honor]] was disrespected or challenged and the conflict could not be resolved in court. Weapons were standardized and must be of the same caliber. The duel lasted until the other party was too weak to fight back and in early cases, the defeated party were then subsequently executed. Examples of these brutal duels were the judicial combat known as the [[Combat of the Thirty]] in 1351, and the [[trial by combat]] fought by [[Jean de Carrouges#Trial by Combat|Jean de Carrouges]] in 1386. A far more chivalric duel which became popular in the Late Middle Ages was the ''[[pas d'armes]]'' or \"passage of arms\". In this [[hastilude]], a knight or a group of knights would claim a bridge, lane or city gate, and challenge other passing knights to fight or be disgraced.<ref>Hubbard, Ben.

[[Thomas Malory|Sir Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (''The Death of Arthur''), written in 1469, was important in defining the [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of chivalry, which is essential to the modern concept of the knight, as an elite warrior sworn to uphold the values of [[faith]], [[loyalty]], [[courage]], and [[honour]].\n\nInstructional literature was also created. [[Geoffroi de Charny]]'s \"[[Book of Chivalry]]\" expounded upon the importance of Christian faith in every area of a knight's life, though still laying stress on the primarily military focus of knighthood.\n\nIn the early Renaissance greater emphasis is laid upon courtliness.

The cost of equipment was also significantly lower, and guns had a reasonable chance to easily penetrate a knight's armour. In the 14th century the use of infantrymen armed with [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] and fighting in close formation also proved effective against heavy cavalry, such as during the [[Battle of Nancy]], when [[Charles the Bold]] and his armoured cavalry were decimated by Swiss pikemen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/middle-ages/knights4.htm|title=History of Knights|publisher=How Stuff Works |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> As the feudal system came to an end, lords saw no further use of knights. Many landowners found the duties of knighthood too expensive and so contented themselves with the use of squires. [[Mercenaries]] also became an economic alternative to knights when conflicts arose.\n\nArmies of the time started adopting a more realistic approach to warfare than the honor-bound code of chivalry. Soon, the remaining knights were absorbed into professional armies. Although they had a higher rank than most soldiers because of their valuable lineage, they lost their distinctive identity that previously set them apart from common soldiers.<ref name=\"End\"/> As the age of knights dissolved, some still survived as knightly orders who still exist even by the end of the Medieval Age. They adopted newer technology while still retaining their age-old chivalric traditions. Examples of holy orders that existed beyond the Middle Ages were the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Knights of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Teutonic Knights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/malta/history/knights/|title=Malta History 1000 AD\u2013present|publisher=Carnaval.com|date=|accessdate=2008-10-12|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Qz9BYYC?url=http://www.carnaval.com/malta/history/knights/|archive-date=2012-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Types of knighthood==\n\n===Hereditary knighthoods===\n====Continental Europe====\nIn continental Europe different systems of hereditary knighthood have existed or do exist. ''[[Ridder (title)|Ridder]]'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"knight\", is a hereditary noble title in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the lowest title within the nobility system and ranks below that of \"[[Baron]]\" but above \"[[Jonkheer]]\" (the latter is not a title, but a Dutch honorific to show that someone belongs to the untitled nobility). The collective term for its holders in a certain locality is the Ridderschap (e.g. Ridderschap van Holland, Ridderschap van Friesland, etc.). In the Netherlands no female equivalent exists. Before 1814, the history of nobility is separate for each of the eleven provinces that make up the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In each of these, there were in the early Middle Ages a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so than the rulers themselves. In old times, no other title existed but that of knight. In the Netherlands only 10 knightly families are still extant, a number which steadily decreases because in that country ennoblement or incorporation into the nobility is not possible anymore.\n[[File:Schlo\u00df Hart Kindberg Hadersdorf.JPG|thumb|[[Fortified house]] \u2013 a [[family seat]] of a knight ([[Schloss Hart]] by the Harter Graben near [[Kindberg]], Austria)]]\nLikewise ''[[Ridder (title)|Ridder]]'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"knight\", or the equivalent [[French language|French]] ''Chevalier'' is a hereditary noble title in [[Belgium]]. It is the second lowest title within the nobility system above [[Jonkheer|''\u00c9cuyer'']] or [[Jonkheer|''Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw'']] and below ''[[Baron]]''. Like in the Netherlands, no female equivalent to the title exists. Belgium still does have about 232 registered [[List of noble families in Belgium#Knights|knightly families]].\n\nThe [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n equivalent of an hereditary knight is a ''[[Ritter]]''. This designation is used as a title of nobility in all German-speaking areas. Traditionally it denotes the second lowest rank within the nobility, standing above \"[[Edler]]\" (noble) and below \"[[Freiherr]]\" (baron). For its historical association with warfare and the [[landed gentry]] in the Middle Ages, it can be considered roughly equal to the titles of \"Knight\" or \"Baronet\".\n\nIn the [[Kingdom of Spain]], the [[Royal House of Spain]] grants titles of knighthood to the successor of the throne. This knighthood title known as [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] is among the most prestigious and exclusive [[Chivalric Orders]]. This Order can also be granted to persons not belonging to the Spanish Crown, as the former [[Emperor of Japan]] [[Akihito]], the current [[Queen of United Kingdom]] [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] or the important Spanish politician of the Spanish democratic transition [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez]], among others.\n\nThe Royal House of Portugal historically bestowed hereditary knighthoods to holders of the highest ranks in the Royal Orders. Today, the head of the Royal House of Portugal Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza bestows hereditary knighthoods for extraordinary acts of sacrifice and service to the Royal House. There are very few hereditary knights and they are entitled to wear a breast star with the crest of the House of Braganza.\n\nIn France, the hereditary knighthood existed in regions formerly under [[Holy Roman Empire]] control. One family ennobled with that title is the [[house of Hauteclocque]] (by letters patents of 1752), even if its most recent members used a [[Black Nobility|pontifical title]] of count.\n\nItaly and Poland also had the hereditary knighthood that existed within the nobility system.\n\n====Ireland====\nThere are traces of the Continental system of hereditary knighthood in Ireland. Notably all three of the following belong to the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], created by the [[Earls of Desmond]], acting as [[Earls Palatine]], for their kinsmen.\n*[[Knight of Kerry]] or Green Knight (FitzGerald of Kerry) \u2014 the current holder is Sir [[Adrian FitzGerald]], 6th Baronet of Valencia, 24th Knight of Kerry.

Baronets are not peers of the Realm, and have never been entitled to sit in the House of Lords, therefore like knights they remain [[commoners]] in the view of the British legal system. However, unlike knights, the title is hereditary and the recipient does not receive an accolade. The position is therefore more comparable with hereditary knighthoods in continental European orders of nobility, such as ''[[ritter]]'', than with knighthoods under the British orders of chivalry. However, unlike the continental orders, the British baronetcy system was a modern invention, designed specifically to raise money for the Crown with the purchase of the title.\n===Chivalric orders===\n{{details|Chivalric order}}\n\n====Military orders ====\n[[File:\"\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0432\u0438 \u0443 \u0413\u0440\u044e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0456 15 \u043b\u0438\u043f\u043d\u044f 1410 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\".jpg|thumb|280px|The [[Battle of Grunwald]] between [[Jagiellon Poland|Poland]]-[[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]] in 1410]]\n{{details|Military order (society)}}\n\n*[[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], founded very shortly after the [[First Crusade]] in 1099\n*[[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], also founded after the [[First Crusade]] in 1099\n*[[Order of Saint Lazarus]] established about 1100\n*[[Knights Templar]], founded 1118, disbanded 1307\n*[[Teutonic Knights]], established about 1190, and ruled the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] in [[Prussia]] until 1525\nOther orders were established in the [[Iberian peninsula]], under the influence of the orders in the Holy Land and the Crusader movement of the [[Reconquista]]:\n{{Main|Spanish military orders}}\n\n*[[Order of Aviz]], established in [[Avis (Portugal)|Avis]] in 1143\n*[[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]], established in [[Alc\u00e1ntara]] in 1156\n*[[Order of Calatrava]], established in [[Calatrava la Vieja|Calatrava]] in 1158\n*[[Order of Santiago]], established in [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]] in 1164.\n\n====Honorific orders of knighthood====\n[[File:Andrea del Castagno 004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pippo Spano]], the member of the [[Order of the Dragon]]]]\nAfter the [[Crusades]], the military orders became idealized and romanticized, resulting in the late medieval notion of [[chivalry]], as reflected in the [[Arthurian]] romances of the time. The creation of chivalric orders was fashionable among the nobility in the 14th and 15th centuries, and this is still reflected in contemporary honours systems, including the term ''[[order (distinction)|order]]'' itself. Examples of notable orders of chivalry are:\n* the [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Order of Saint George]], founded by [[Charles&nbsp;I of Hungary]] in 1325/6\n* the [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Order of the Most Holy Annunciation]], founded by Count [[Amadeus&nbsp;VI]] in 1346\n* the [[Order of the Garter]], founded by [[Edward&nbsp;III of England]] around 1348\n* the [[Order of the Dragon]], founded by King [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] in 1408\n* the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], founded by [[Philip&nbsp;III, Duke of Burgundy]] in 1430\n* the [[Order of Saint Michael]], founded by [[Louis&nbsp;XI of France]] in 1469\n* the [[Order of the Thistle]], founded by King James&nbsp;VII of Scotland (also known as [[James&nbsp;II of England]]) in 1687\n* the [[Order of the Elephant]], which may have been first founded by [[Christian&nbsp;I of Denmark]], but was founded in its current form by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian&nbsp;V]] in 1693\n* the [[Order of the Bath]], founded by [[George I of Great Britain|George&nbsp;I]] in 1725\n\n[[File:Admiral_Drake_knighted_by_Queen_Elizabeth%27_(Sir_Francis_Drake)_from_NPG.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Francis Drake]] (left) being knighted by  Queen [[Elizabeth&nbsp;I]] in 1581. The recipient is tapped on each shoulder with a sword.]]\nFrom roughly 1560, purely honorific orders were established, as a way to confer prestige and distinction, unrelated to military service and chivalry in the more narrow sense. Such orders were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and knighthood continues to be conferred in various countries:\n\n* The [[United Kingdom]] (see [[British honours system]]) and some [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries such as [[New Zealand]];\n* Some [[Europe]]an countries, such as The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] among others (see below).\n* The [[Holy See]] &mdash; see [[Papal Orders of Chivalry]].\n\nThere are other [[monarchy|monarchies]] and also [[republic]]s that also follow this practice. Modern knighthoods are typically conferred in recognition for services rendered to society, which are not necessarily martial in nature. The British musician [[Elton John]], for example, is a [[Knight Bachelor]], thus entitled to be called Sir Elton. The female equivalent is a ''[[Dame (title)|Dame]]'', for example Dame [[Julie Andrews]].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], honorific knighthood may be conferred in two different ways:\n\nThe first is by membership of one of the ''pure'' [[Orders of Chivalry]] such as the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]] and the dormant [[Order of Saint Patrick]], of which all members are knighted. In addition, many British [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]], namely the [[Order of the Bath]], the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], the [[Royal Victorian Order]] and the [[Order of the British Empire]] are part of the [[British honours system]], and the award of their highest ranks (Knight/Dame Commander and Knight/Dame Grand Cross), comes together with an honorific knighthood, making them a cross between orders of chivalry and orders of merit. By contrast, membership of other British [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]], such as the [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Order of Merit]] and the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] does not confer a knighthood.\n\nThe second is being granted honorific knighthood by the British sovereign without membership of an order, the recipient being called [[Knight Bachelor]].\n\nIn the British honours system the knightly style of ''Sir'' and its female equivalent ''Dame'' are followed by the [[given name]] only when addressing the holder. Thus, [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]] should be addressed as ''Sir Elton'', not ''Sir John'' or ''Mr John''. Similarly, actress [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]] should be addressed as ''Dame Judi'', not ''Dame Dench'' or ''Ms Dench''.\n\nWives of knights, however, are entitled to the honorific pre-nominal \"Lady\" before their husband's surname. Thus [[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]]'s ex-wife was formally styled ''Lady McCartney'' (rather than ''Lady Paul McCartney'' or ''Lady Heather McCartney''). The style ''Dame Heather McCartney'' could be used for the wife of a knight; however, this style is largely archaic and is only used in the most formal of documents, or where the wife is a Dame in her own right (such as Dame [[Norma Major]], who gained her title six years before her husband Sir [[John Major]] was knighted). The husbands of Dames have no honorific pre-nominal, so Dame Norma's husband remained John Major until he received his own knighthood.[[File:Cr\u00e9cy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|The English fighting the French knights at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346]] Since the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] a [[Anglican ministry|clerk in holy orders]] in the [[Church of England]] has not normally received the [[accolade]] on being appointed to a degree of knighthood. He receives the insignia of his honour and may place the appropriate letters after his name or title but he may not be called Sir and his wife may not be called Lady. This custom is not observed in Australia and New Zealand, where knighted Anglican clergymen routinely use the title \"Sir\". [[Clergy|Ministers]] of other Christian Churches are entitled to receive the accolade. For example, [[Norman Gilroy|Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy]] did receive the accolade on his appointment as [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] in 1969. A knight who is subsequently ordained does not lose his title. A famous example of this situation was [[Derek Pattinson|The Revd Sir Derek Pattinson]], who was ordained just a year after he was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]], apparently somewhat to the consternation of officials at Buckingham Palace.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1879386.ece |title=Michael De-La-Noy, obituary in |work=The Independent |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123110436/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1879386.ece |archivedate=2007-11-23 }}</ref> A woman clerk in holy orders may be made a Dame in exactly the same way as any other woman since there are no military connotations attached to the honour. A clerk in holy orders who is a [[baronet]] is entitled to use the title Sir.\n\nOutside the British honours system it is usually considered improper to address a knighted person as 'Sir' or 'Dame'. Some countries, however, historically ''did'' have equivalent honorifics for knights, such as [[Cavaliere]] in [[Italy]] (e.g. ''Cavaliere'' [[Benito Mussolini]]), and [[Ritter]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (e.g. [[Georg von Trapp|Georg ''Ritter'' von Trapp'']]).\n\n[[File:Battle of Montiel.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from [[Jean Froissart]] ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles]]'' depicting the [[Battle of Montiel]] (Castilian Civil War, in the [[Hundred Years' War]])]]\nState Knighthoods in the Netherlands are issued in three orders, the [[Order of William]], the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], and the [[Order of Orange Nassau]]. Additionally there remain a few hereditary knights in the Netherlands.\n\nIn [[Belgium]], honorific knighthood (not hereditary) can be conferred by the King on particularly meritorious individuals such as scientists or eminent businessmen, or for instance to [[astronaut]] [[Frank De Winne]], the second Belgian in space. This practice is similar to the conferral of the dignity of [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In addition, there still are a number of hereditary knights in Belgium (see below).\n\nIn [[France]] and [[Belgium]], one of the ranks conferred in some [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]], such as the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]], the [[Ordre National du M\u00e9rite]], the [[Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques]] and the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in France, and the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]], [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and [[Order of Leopold&nbsp;II]] in Belgium, is that of ''Chevalier'' (in French) or ''Ridder'' (in Dutch), meaning Knight.\n\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] the monarchs tried to establish chivalric orders but the hereditary lords who controlled the Union did not agree and managed to ban such assemblies. They feared the King would use Orders to gain support for absolutist goals and to make formal distinctions among the peerage which could lead to its legal breakup into two separate classes, and that the King would later play one against the other and eventually limit the legal privileges of hereditary nobility. But finally in 1705 King {{nowrap|August II}} managed to establish the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] which remains Poland's most prestigious order of that kind. The head of state (now the President as the acting Grand Master) confers knighthoods of the Order to distinguished citizens, foreign monarchs and other heads of state. The Order has its Chapter. There were no particular honorifics that would accompany a knight's name as historically all (or at least by far most) of its members would be royals or hereditary lords anyway. So today, a knight is simply referred to as \"Name Surname, knight of the White Eagle (Order)\".\n\n====Women====\n=====England and the United Kingdom=====\nWomen were appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]] almost from the start. In all, 68 women were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments of women are known, although it is said that the Garter was conferred upon Neapolitan poet Laura Bacio Terricina, by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]]. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but this did not occur. [[List of British consorts|Queens consort]] have been made [[List of Knights and Ladies of the Garter|Ladies of the Garter]] since 1901 ([[Alexandra of Denmark|Queens Alexandra]] in 1901,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 27284|date= 13 February 1901|page=1139|supp=y }}</ref> [[Mary of Teck|Mary]] in 1910 and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]] in 1937).

(See Edmund Fellowes, ''Knights of the Garter'', 1939; and Beltz: ''Memorials of the Order of the Garter''). The first woman to be granted a knighthood in modern Britain seems to have been H.H. Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal, who became a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1861, at the foundation of the order. Her daughter received the same honor in 1872, as well as her granddaughter in 1910. The order was open to \"princes and chiefs\" without distinction of gender. The first European woman to have been granted an order of knighthood was Queen Mary, when she was made a Knight Grand Commander of the same order, by special statute, in celebration of the Delhi Durbar of 1911.<ref>Biddle, Daniel A.

The other was possibly for a female knight. Here is a quote from Menestrier, a 17th-century writer on chivalry: \"It was not always necessary to be the wife of a knight in order to take this title. Sometimes, when some male fiefs were conceded by special privilege to women, they took the rank of chevaleresse, as one sees plainly in Hemricourt where women who were not wives of knights are called chevaleresses.\" Modern French orders of knighthood include women, for example the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur ([[Legion of Honor]]) since the mid-19th century, but they are usually called chevaliers. The first documented case is that of [[Ang\u00e9lique Br\u00fblon]] (1772\u20131859), who fought in the Revolutionary Wars, received a military disability pension in 1798, the rank of 2nd lieutenant in 1822, and the Legion of Honor in 1852. A recipient of the Ordre National du M\u00e9rite recently requested from the order's Chancery the permission to call herself \"chevali\u00e8re,\" and the request was granted (AFP dispatch, Jan 28, 2000).<ref name=\"heraldica1\"/>\n\n=====Italy=====\nAs related in ''Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See'' by H. E. Cardinale (1983), the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] was founded by two Bolognese nobles [[Loderingo degli Andal\u00f2]] and Catalano di Guido  in 1233, and approved by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in 1261. It was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of militissa to women. However, this order was suppressed by [[Sixtus V]] in 1558.<ref name=\"heraldica1\"/>\n\n=====The Low Countries=====\nAt the initiative of Catherine Baw in 1441, and 10 years later of Elizabeth, Mary, and Isabella of the house of Hornes, orders were founded which were open exclusively to women of noble birth, who received the French title of chevali\u00e8re or the Latin title of equitissa. In his Glossarium (s.v. militissa), Du Cange notes that still in his day (17th century), the female canons of the canonical monastery of St. Gertrude in Nivelles (Brabant), after a probation of 3 years, are made knights (militissae) at the altar, by a (male) knight called in for that purpose, who gives them the accolade with a sword and pronounces the usual words.<ref name=\"heraldica1\"/>\n\n=====Spain=====\n[[File:Cantigas battle.jpg|thumb|A battle of the ''[[Reconquista]]'' from the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'']]\nTo honour those women who defended [[Tortosa]] against an attack by the [[Moors]], [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], created the Order of the Hatchet (''Orden de la Hacha'') in 1149.<ref name=\"heraldica1\"/>\n\n{{quote|The inhabitants [of Tortosa] being at length reduced to great streights, desired relief of the Earl, but he, being not in a condition to give them any, they entertained some thoughts of making a surrender.

The Earl, finding himself obliged, by the gallentry of the action, thought fit to make his acknowlegements thereof, by granting them several Privileges and Immunities, and to perpetuate the memory of so signal an attempt, instituted an Order, somewhat like a Military Order, into which were admitted only those Brave Women, deriving the honour to their Descendants, and assigned them for a Badge, a thing like a Fryars Capouche, sharp at the top, after the form of a Torch, and of a crimson colour, to be worn upon their Head-clothes. He also ordained, that at all publick meetings, the women should have precedence of the Men. That they should be exempted from all Taxes, and that all the Apparel and Jewels, though of never so great value, left by their dead Husbands, should be their own.

By the [[Late Middle Ages]], the rank had become associated with the ideals of [[chivalry]], a [[code of conduct]] for the perfect [[Court (royal)|courtly]] Christian warrior.

Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with [[horsemanship]] (and especially the [[joust]]) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the [[high nobility]] in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of ''chivalry'', ''cavalier'' and related terms. In that sense, the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in [[Christendom]] finds a parallel in the ''[[furusiyya]]'' in the [[Islamic world]].\n\nIn the [[Late Medieval period]], [[military history|new methods of warfare]] began to render classical knights in armour obsolete. Yet, the titles remained in many countries. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in [[medieval literature]], particularly the literary cycles known as the [[Matter of France]], relating to the legendary companions of [[Charlemagne]] and his [[men-at-arms]], the [[paladins]], and the [[Matter of Britain]], relating to the legend of [[King Arthur]] and his [[knights of the Round Table|knights]] of the [[Round Table]].\n\nToday, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in [[Christian denomination|Christian Churches]], as well as in several historically [[Christian countries]] and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], the Protestant [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Order of Saint John]], as well as the English [[Order of the Garter]], the Swedish [[Royal Order of the Seraphim]], and the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]]. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a [[head of state]], [[monarch]], or [[prelate]] to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the [[British honours system]], often for service to the Church or country. The modern female equivalent in [[English language|English]] is [[Dame]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''knight'', from [[Old English]] ''cniht'' (\"boy\" or \"servant\"),<ref name=\"Etymo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=k&p=3 |title=Knight |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> is a [[cognate]] of the [[German language|German]] word ''Knecht'' (\"servant, bondsman, vassal\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=KO6ek.&search=Knecht |title=Knecht |work=LEO German-English dictionary |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> This meaning, of unknown origin, is common among [[West Germanic languages]] (cf [[Old Frisian]] ''kniucht'', Dutch ''knecht'', Danish ''kn\u00e6gt'', Swedish ''knekt'', Norwegian ''knekt'', [[Middle High German]] ''kneht'', all meaning \"boy, youth, lad\").<ref name=\"Etymo\" /> [[Middle High German]] had the phrase ''guoter kneht'', which also meant knight; but this meaning was in decline by about 1200.<ref>William Henry Jackson. \"Aspects of Knighthood in Hartmann's Adaptations of Chretien's Romances and in the Social Context.\" In ''Chretien de Troyes and the German Middle Ages: Papers from an International Symposium'', ed. Martin H. Jones and Roy Wisbey. Suffolk: D. S. Brewer, 1993. 37\u201355.</ref>\n\nThe meaning of ''cniht'' changed over time from its original meaning of \"boy\" to \"household [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]]\". [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham|\u00c6lfric]]'s homily of St. [[Swithun]] describes a mounted retainer as a ''cniht''.

Vassals and lords could maintain any number of knights, although knights with more military experience were those most sought after. Thus, all [[Petty nobility|petty noble]]s intending to become prosperous knights needed a great deal of military experience.<ref name=\"Fact\" /> A knight fighting under another's banner was called a ''[[knight bachelor]]'' while a knight fighting under his own banner was a ''[[knight banneret]]''.\n\n====Page====\nA knight had to be born of nobility &ndash; typically sons of knights or lords.<ref name=\"Craig\" /> In some cases commoners could also be knighted as a reward for extraordinary military service.

Pages then become assistants to older knights in battle, carrying and cleaning armour, taking care of the horses, and packing the baggage. They would accompany the knights on expeditions, even into foreign lands. Older pages were instructed by knights in [[swordsmanship]], [[equestrianism]], chivalry, warfare, and combat (but using wooden swords and spears).\n\n====Squire====\nWhen the boy turned 15, he became a ''[[squire]]''. In a religious ceremony, the new squire swore on a sword consecrated by a bishop or priest, and attended to assigned duties in his lord's household.

When knights were taken as prisoners of war, they were customarily held for ransom in somewhat comfortable surroundings. This same standard of conduct did not apply to non-knights (archers, peasants, foot-soldiers, etc.) who were often slaughtered after capture, and who were viewed during battle as mere impediments to knights' getting to other knights to fight them.<ref>See Marcia L. Colish, ''The Mirror of Language: A Study in the Medieval Theory of Knowledge''; University of Nebraska Press, 1983. p. 105.</ref>\n\nChivalry developed as an early standard of [[professional ethics]] for knights, who were relatively affluent horse owners and were expected to provide military services in exchange for [[landed property]]. Early notions of chivalry entailed loyalty to one's [[Homage (feudal)|liege lord]] and bravery in battle, similar to the values of the [[Germanic Heroic Age|Heroic Age]]. During the Middle Ages, this grew from simple military professionalism into a social code including the values of gentility, nobility and treating others reasonably.<ref>Keen, Maurice Keen. Chivalry.

Medieval tournaments were made up of martial sports called ''[[hastilude]]s'', and were not only a major spectator sport but also played as a real combat simulation. It usually ended with many knights either injured or even killed. One contest was a free-for-all battle called a ''[[Melee (tournament)|melee]]'', where large groups of knights numbering hundreds assembled and fought one another, and the last knight standing was the winner. The most popular and romanticized contest for knights was the ''[[joust]]''. In this competition, two knights charge each other with blunt wooden lances in an effort to break their lance on the opponent's head or body or unhorse them completely. The loser in these tournaments had to turn his armour and horse over to the victor. The last day was filled with feasting, dancing and [[minstrel]] singing.\n\nBesides formal tournaments, they were also unformalized [[judicial duels]] done by knights and squires to end various disputes.<ref name=\"Dav\">David Levinson and Karen Christensen.

Judicial combat was of two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat.<ref name=\"Dav\"/> The feat of arms were done to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The chivalric combat was fought when one party's [[honor]] was disrespected or challenged and the conflict could not be resolved in court. Weapons were standardized and must be of the same caliber. The duel lasted until the other party was too weak to fight back and in early cases, the defeated party were then subsequently executed. Examples of these brutal duels were the judicial combat known as the [[Combat of the Thirty]] in 1351, and the [[trial by combat]] fought by [[Jean de Carrouges#Trial by Combat|Jean de Carrouges]] in 1386. A far more chivalric duel which became popular in the Late Middle Ages was the ''[[pas d'armes]]'' or \"passage of arms\".

The ideal courtier\u2014the chivalrous knight\u2014of Baldassarre Castiglione's ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' became a model of the ideal virtues of nobility.<ref>Hare (1908), p. 201.</ref>  Castiglione's tale took the form of a discussion among the nobility of the court of the Duke of Urbino, in which the characters determine that the ideal knight should be renowned not only for his bravery and prowess in battle, but also as a skilled dancer, athlete, singer and orator, and he should also be well-read in the [[humanities]] and classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] literature.<ref>Hare (1908), pp. 211\u2013218.</ref>\n\nLater Renaissance literature, such as [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', rejected the code of chivalry as unrealistic idealism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eisenberg, Daniel|title=A Study of \"Don Quixote\"|location=Newark, Delaware|publisher=Juan de la Cuesta|date=1987|isbn=0936388315|pages=41\u201377|quote=Revised Spanish translation in Biblioteca Virtual Cervantes}}</ref>  The rise of [[Christian humanism]] in [[Renaissance literature]] demonstrated a marked departure from the chivalric romance of late medieval literature, and the chivalric ideal ceased to influence literature over successive centuries until it saw some pockets of revival in post-Victorian literature.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Decline==\n{{main|Military history}}\n[[File:Manif. di bruxelles su dis.di bernart von orley, arazzi della battaglia di pavia, attacco alla gendarmeria francese, IGMN144483, 1526-31.JPG|thumb|300px|The [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525.

The cost of equipment was also significantly lower, and guns had a reasonable chance to easily penetrate a knight's armour. In the 14th century the use of infantrymen armed with [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] and fighting in close formation also proved effective against heavy cavalry, such as during the [[Battle of Nancy]], when [[Charles the Bold]] and his armoured cavalry were decimated by Swiss pikemen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/middle-ages/knights4.htm|title=History of Knights|publisher=How Stuff Works |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> As the feudal system came to an end, lords saw no further use of knights. Many landowners found the duties of knighthood too expensive and so contented themselves with the use of squires. [[Mercenaries]] also became an economic alternative to knights when conflicts arose.\n\nArmies of the time started adopting a more realistic approach to warfare than the honor-bound code of chivalry. Soon, the remaining knights were absorbed into professional armies. Although they had a higher rank than most soldiers because of their valuable lineage, they lost their distinctive identity that previously set them apart from common soldiers.<ref name=\"End\"/> As the age of knights dissolved, some still survived as knightly orders who still exist even by the end of the Medieval Age. They adopted newer technology while still retaining their age-old chivalric traditions. Examples of holy orders that existed beyond the Middle Ages were the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Knights of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Teutonic Knights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/malta/history/knights/|title=Malta History 1000 AD\u2013present|publisher=Carnaval.com|date=|accessdate=2008-10-12|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Qz9BYYC?url=http://www.carnaval.com/malta/history/knights/|archive-date=2012-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Types of knighthood==\n\n===Hereditary knighthoods===\n====Continental Europe====\nIn continental Europe different systems of hereditary knighthood have existed or do exist. ''[[Ridder (title)|Ridder]]'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"knight\", is a hereditary noble title in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the lowest title within the nobility system and ranks below that of \"[[Baron]]\" but above \"[[Jonkheer]]\" (the latter is not a title, but a Dutch honorific to show that someone belongs to the untitled nobility). The collective term for its holders in a certain locality is the Ridderschap (e.g. Ridderschap van Holland, Ridderschap van Friesland, etc.). In the Netherlands no female equivalent exists. Before 1814, the history of nobility is separate for each of the eleven provinces that make up the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In each of these, there were in the early Middle Ages a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so than the rulers themselves. In old times, no other title existed but that of knight. In the Netherlands only 10 knightly families are still extant, a number which steadily decreases because in that country ennoblement or incorporation into the nobility is not possible anymore.\n[[File:Schlo\u00df Hart Kindberg Hadersdorf.JPG|thumb|[[Fortified house]] \u2013 a [[family seat]] of a knight ([[Schloss Hart]] by the Harter Graben near [[Kindberg]], Austria)]]\nLikewise ''[[Ridder (title)|Ridder]]'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"knight\", or the equivalent [[French language|French]] ''Chevalier'' is a hereditary noble title in [[Belgium]]. It is the second lowest title within the nobility system above [[Jonkheer|''\u00c9cuyer'']] or [[Jonkheer|''Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw'']] and below ''[[Baron]]''. Like in the Netherlands, no female equivalent to the title exists. Belgium still does have about 232 registered [[List of noble families in Belgium#Knights|knightly families]].\n\nThe [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n equivalent of an hereditary knight is a ''[[Ritter]]''. This designation is used as a title of nobility in all German-speaking areas. Traditionally it denotes the second lowest rank within the nobility, standing above \"[[Edler]]\" (noble) and below \"[[Freiherr]]\" (baron). For its historical association with warfare and the [[landed gentry]] in the Middle Ages, it can be considered roughly equal to the titles of \"Knight\" or \"Baronet\".\n\nIn the [[Kingdom of Spain]], the [[Royal House of Spain]] grants titles of knighthood to the successor of the throne. This knighthood title known as [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] is among the most prestigious and exclusive [[Chivalric Orders]]. This Order can also be granted to persons not belonging to the Spanish Crown, as the former [[Emperor of Japan]] [[Akihito]], the current [[Queen of United Kingdom]] [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] or the important Spanish politician of the Spanish democratic transition [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez]], among others.\n\nThe Royal House of Portugal historically bestowed hereditary knighthoods to holders of the highest ranks in the Royal Orders. Today, the head of the Royal House of Portugal Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza bestows hereditary knighthoods for extraordinary acts of sacrifice and service to the Royal House. There are very few hereditary knights and they are entitled to wear a breast star with the crest of the House of Braganza.\n\nIn France, the hereditary knighthood existed in regions formerly under [[Holy Roman Empire]] control. One family ennobled with that title is the [[house of Hauteclocque]] (by letters patents of 1752), even if its most recent members used a [[Black Nobility|pontifical title]] of count.\n\nItaly and Poland also had the hereditary knighthood that existed within the nobility system.\n\n====Ireland====\nThere are traces of the Continental system of hereditary knighthood in Ireland. Notably all three of the following belong to the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], created by the [[Earls of Desmond]], acting as [[Earls Palatine]], for their kinsmen.\n*[[Knight of Kerry]] or Green Knight (FitzGerald of Kerry) \u2014 the current holder is Sir [[Adrian FitzGerald]], 6th Baronet of Valencia, 24th Knight of Kerry. He is also a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Malta]], and has served as President of the Irish Association of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].\n*[[Knight of Glin]] or Black Knight (FitzGerald of Limerick) \u2014 now dormant.\n*[[White Knight (Fitzgibbon family)|White Knight]] (see [[Edmund Fitzgibbon]]) \u2014 now dormant.\n\nAnother Irish family were the [[O'Shaughnessy]]s, who were created knights in 1553 under the policy of [[surrender and regrant]]<ref>[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]], \"[http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/EarlsDesmondUJA6-1858/index.php  The Descendants of the Last Earls of Desmond]\", ''Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Volume 6''. 1858.</ref> (first established by [[Henry VIII of England]]). They were [[Attainder|attainted]] in 1697 for participation on the Jacobite side in the Williamite wars.<ref>''The History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Kilmacduagh'' by Jerome Fahey 1893 p.326</ref>\n\n====British baronetcies====\nSince 1611, the British Crown has awarded a hereditary title in the form of the [[baronet]]cy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Bernard & Ashworth Burke|title=General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire|year=1914|publisher=Burke's Peerage Limited|location=London|pages=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf8cAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR3#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 December 2011|quote=The hereditary Order of Baronets was erected by patent in England by King James I in 1611, extended to Ireland by the same Monarch in 1619, and first conferred in Scotland by King Charles I in 1625.}}</ref> Like knights, baronets are accorded the title ''Sir''. Baronets are not peers of the Realm, and have never been entitled to sit in the House of Lords, therefore like knights they remain [[commoners]] in the view of the British legal system. However, unlike knights, the title is hereditary and the recipient does not receive an accolade. The position is therefore more comparable with hereditary knighthoods in continental European orders of nobility, such as ''[[ritter]]'', than with knighthoods under the British orders of chivalry. However, unlike the continental orders, the British baronetcy system was a modern invention, designed specifically to raise money for the Crown with the purchase of the title.\n===Chivalric orders===\n{{details|Chivalric order}}\n\n====Military orders ====\n[[File:\"\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0432\u0438 \u0443 \u0413\u0440\u044e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0456 15 \u043b\u0438\u043f\u043d\u044f 1410 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\".jpg|thumb|280px|The [[Battle of Grunwald]] between [[Jagiellon Poland|Poland]]-[[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]] in 1410]]\n{{details|Military order (society)}}\n\n*[[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], founded very shortly after the [[First Crusade]] in 1099\n*[[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], also founded after the [[First Crusade]] in 1099\n*[[Order of Saint Lazarus]] established about 1100\n*[[Knights Templar]], founded 1118, disbanded 1307\n*[[Teutonic Knights]], established about 1190, and ruled the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] in [[Prussia]] until 1525\nOther orders were established in the [[Iberian peninsula]], under the influence of the orders in the Holy Land and the Crusader movement of the [[Reconquista]]:\n{{Main|Spanish military orders}}\n\n*[[Order of Aviz]], established in [[Avis (Portugal)|Avis]] in 1143\n*[[Order of Alc\u00e1ntara]], established in [[Alc\u00e1ntara]] in 1156\n*[[Order of Calatrava]], established in [[Calatrava la Vieja|Calatrava]] in 1158\n*[[Order of Santiago]], established in [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]] in 1164.\n\n====Honorific orders of knighthood====\n[[File:Andrea del Castagno 004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pippo Spano]], the member of the [[Order of the Dragon]]]]\nAfter the [[Crusades]], the military orders became idealized and romanticized, resulting in the late medieval notion of [[chivalry]], as reflected in the [[Arthurian]] romances of the time. The creation of chivalric orders was fashionable among the nobility in the 14th and 15th centuries, and this is still reflected in contemporary honours systems, including the term ''[[order (distinction)|order]]'' itself. Examples of notable orders of chivalry are:\n* the [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Order of Saint George]], founded by [[Charles&nbsp;I of Hungary]] in 1325/6\n* the [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Order of the Most Holy Annunciation]], founded by Count [[Amadeus&nbsp;VI]] in 1346\n* the [[Order of the Garter]], founded by [[Edward&nbsp;III of England]] around 1348\n* the [[Order of the Dragon]], founded by King [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] in 1408\n* the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], founded by [[Philip&nbsp;III, Duke of Burgundy]] in 1430\n* the [[Order of Saint Michael]], founded by [[Louis&nbsp;XI of France]] in 1469\n* the [[Order of the Thistle]], founded by King James&nbsp;VII of Scotland (also known as [[James&nbsp;II of England]]) in 1687\n* the [[Order of the Elephant]], which may have been first founded by [[Christian&nbsp;I of Denmark]], but was founded in its current form by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian&nbsp;V]] in 1693\n* the [[Order of the Bath]], founded by [[George I of Great Britain|George&nbsp;I]] in 1725\n\n[[File:Admiral_Drake_knighted_by_Queen_Elizabeth%27_(Sir_Francis_Drake)_from_NPG.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Francis Drake]] (left) being knighted by  Queen [[Elizabeth&nbsp;I]] in 1581. The recipient is tapped on each shoulder with a sword.]]\nFrom roughly 1560, purely honorific orders were established, as a way to confer prestige and distinction, unrelated to military service and chivalry in the more narrow sense. Such orders were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and knighthood continues to be conferred in various countries:\n\n* The [[United Kingdom]] (see [[British honours system]]) and some [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries such as [[New Zealand]];\n* Some [[Europe]]an countries, such as The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] among others (see below).\n* The [[Holy See]] &mdash; see [[Papal Orders of Chivalry]].\n\nThere are other [[monarchy|monarchies]] and also [[republic]]s that also follow this practice. Modern knighthoods are typically conferred in recognition for services rendered to society, which are not necessarily martial in nature. The British musician [[Elton John]], for example, is a [[Knight Bachelor]], thus entitled to be called Sir Elton. The female equivalent is a ''[[Dame (title)|Dame]]'', for example Dame [[Julie Andrews]].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], honorific knighthood may be conferred in two different ways:\n\nThe first is by membership of one of the ''pure'' [[Orders of Chivalry]] such as the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]] and the dormant [[Order of Saint Patrick]], of which all members are knighted. In addition, many British [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]], namely the [[Order of the Bath]], the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], the [[Royal Victorian Order]] and the [[Order of the British Empire]] are part of the [[British honours system]], and the award of their highest ranks (Knight/Dame Commander and Knight/Dame Grand Cross), comes together with an honorific knighthood, making them a cross between orders of chivalry and orders of merit. By contrast, membership of other British [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]], such as the [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Order of Merit]] and the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] does not confer a knighthood.\n\nThe second is being granted honorific knighthood by the British sovereign without membership of an order, the recipient being called [[Knight Bachelor]].\n\nIn the British honours system the knightly style of ''Sir'' and its female equivalent ''Dame'' are followed by the [[given name]] only when addressing the holder. Thus, [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]] should be addressed as ''Sir Elton'', not ''Sir John'' or ''Mr John''. Similarly, actress [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]] should be addressed as ''Dame Judi'', not ''Dame Dench'' or ''Ms Dench''.\n\nWives of knights, however, are entitled to the honorific pre-nominal \"Lady\" before their husband's surname. Thus [[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]]'s ex-wife was formally styled ''Lady McCartney'' (rather than ''Lady Paul McCartney'' or ''Lady Heather McCartney''). The style ''Dame Heather McCartney'' could be used for the wife of a knight; however, this style is largely archaic and is only used in the most formal of documents, or where the wife is a Dame in her own right (such as Dame [[Norma Major]], who gained her title six years before her husband Sir [[John Major]] was knighted). The husbands of Dames have no honorific pre-nominal, so Dame Norma's husband remained John Major until he received his own knighthood.[[File:Cr\u00e9cy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|The English fighting the French knights at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346]] Since the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] a [[Anglican ministry|clerk in holy orders]] in the [[Church of England]] has not normally received the [[accolade]] on being appointed to a degree of knighthood. He receives the insignia of his honour and may place the appropriate letters after his name or title but he may not be called Sir and his wife may not be called Lady. This custom is not observed in Australia and New Zealand, where knighted Anglican clergymen routinely use the title \"Sir\". [[Clergy|Ministers]] of other Christian Churches are entitled to receive the accolade. For example, [[Norman Gilroy|Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy]] did receive the accolade on his appointment as [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] in 1969. A knight who is subsequently ordained does not lose his title. A famous example of this situation was [[Derek Pattinson|The Revd Sir Derek Pattinson]], who was ordained just a year after he was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]], apparently somewhat to the consternation of officials at Buckingham Palace.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1879386.ece |title=Michael De-La-Noy, obituary in |work=The Independent |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123110436/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1879386.ece |archivedate=2007-11-23 }}</ref> A woman clerk in holy orders may be made a Dame in exactly the same way as any other woman since there are no military connotations attached to the honour. A clerk in holy orders who is a [[baronet]] is entitled to use the title Sir.\n\nOutside the British honours system it is usually considered improper to address a knighted person as 'Sir' or 'Dame'. Some countries, however, historically ''did'' have equivalent honorifics for knights, such as [[Cavaliere]] in [[Italy]] (e.g. ''Cavaliere'' [[Benito Mussolini]]), and [[Ritter]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (e.g. [[Georg von Trapp|Georg ''Ritter'' von Trapp'']]).\n\n[[File:Battle of Montiel.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from [[Jean Froissart]] ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles]]'' depicting the [[Battle of Montiel]] (Castilian Civil War, in the [[Hundred Years' War]])]]\nState Knighthoods in the Netherlands are issued in three orders, the [[Order of William]], the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], and the [[Order of Orange Nassau]]. Additionally there remain a few hereditary knights in the Netherlands.\n\nIn [[Belgium]], honorific knighthood (not hereditary) can be conferred by the King on particularly meritorious individuals such as scientists or eminent businessmen, or for instance to [[astronaut]] [[Frank De Winne]], the second Belgian in space. This practice is similar to the conferral of the dignity of [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In addition, there still are a number of hereditary knights in Belgium (see below).\n\nIn [[France]] and [[Belgium]], one of the ranks conferred in some [[Order (honour)|Orders of Merit]], such as the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]], the [[Ordre National du M\u00e9rite]], the [[Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques]] and the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in France, and the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]], [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and [[Order of Leopold&nbsp;II]] in Belgium, is that of ''Chevalier'' (in French) or ''Ridder'' (in Dutch), meaning Knight.\n\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] the monarchs tried to establish chivalric orders but the hereditary lords who controlled the Union did not agree and managed to ban such assemblies. They feared the King would use Orders to gain support for absolutist goals and to make formal distinctions among the peerage which could lead to its legal breakup into two separate classes, and that the King would later play one against the other and eventually limit the legal privileges of hereditary nobility. But finally in 1705 King {{nowrap|August II}} managed to establish the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] which remains Poland's most prestigious order of that kind. The head of state (now the President as the acting Grand Master) confers knighthoods of the Order to distinguished citizens, foreign monarchs and other heads of state. The Order has its Chapter. There were no particular honorifics that would accompany a knight's name as historically all (or at least by far most) of its members would be royals or hereditary lords anyway. So today, a knight is simply referred to as \"Name Surname, knight of the White Eagle (Order)\".\n\n====Women====\n=====England and the United Kingdom=====\nWomen were appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]] almost from the start. In all, 68 women were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments of women are known, although it is said that the Garter was conferred upon Neapolitan poet Laura Bacio Terricina, by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]]. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but this did not occur. [[List of British consorts|Queens consort]] have been made [[List of Knights and Ladies of the Garter|Ladies of the Garter]] since 1901 ([[Alexandra of Denmark|Queens Alexandra]] in 1901,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 27284|date= 13 February 1901|page=1139|supp=y }}</ref> [[Mary of Teck|Mary]] in 1910 and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]] in 1937). The first non-royal woman to be made Lady Companion of the Garter was [[Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk|The Duchess of Norfolk]] in 1990,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 52120|date= 24 April 1990|page=8251}}</ref> the second was [[Margaret Thatcher|The Baroness Thatcher]] in 1995<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 54017|date= 25 April 1995|page=6023}}</ref> (post-nominal: LG).

(See Edmund Fellowes, ''Knights of the Garter'', 1939; and Beltz: ''Memorials of the Order of the Garter''). The first woman to be granted a knighthood in modern Britain seems to have been H.H. Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal, who became a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1861, at the foundation of the order. Her daughter received the same honor in 1872, as well as her granddaughter in 1910. The order was open to \"princes and chiefs\" without distinction of gender. The first European woman to have been granted an order of knighthood was Queen Mary, when she was made a Knight Grand Commander of the same order, by special statute, in celebration of the Delhi Durbar of 1911.<ref>Biddle, Daniel A.

The other was possibly for a female knight. Here is a quote from Menestrier, a 17th-century writer on chivalry: \"It was not always necessary to be the wife of a knight in order to take this title. Sometimes, when some male fiefs were conceded by special privilege to women, they took the rank of chevaleresse, as one sees plainly in Hemricourt where women who were not wives of knights are called chevaleresses.\" Modern French orders of knighthood include women, for example the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur ([[Legion of Honor]]) since the mid-19th century, but they are usually called chevaliers. The first documented case is that of [[Ang\u00e9lique Br\u00fblon]] (1772\u20131859), who fought in the Revolutionary Wars, received a military disability pension in 1798, the rank of 2nd lieutenant in 1822, and the Legion of Honor in 1852. A recipient of the Ordre National du M\u00e9rite recently requested from the order's Chancery the permission to call herself \"chevali\u00e8re,\" and the request was granted (AFP dispatch, Jan 28, 2000).<ref name=\"heraldica1\"/>\n\n=====Italy=====\nAs related in ''Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See'' by H. E. Cardinale (1983), the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] was founded by two Bolognese nobles [[Loderingo degli Andal\u00f2]] and Catalano di Guido  in 1233, and approved by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in 1261. It was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of militissa to women.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Beginning in September 1899 several employees of the DCS&I, which had a policy of not employing unionized members, [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union, and were subsequently terminated. After the intervention of law enforcement, the strike was settled three months later when the DCS&I reaffirmed their policy of not hiring union members.<ref>Dub\u00e9 2008, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a [[froth flotation|flotation plant]] to produce [[copper sulfate]] in the 1920s. [[iron ore|Iron]] and [[zinc#production|zinc concentrate]]s were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s. J.N. Houser, the head of the TCC at this time, further expanded the products produced in the basin and allowed the employees to unionize.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 30</ref> In 1937, due to a dispute between the three unions representing the miners, the TCC was essentially divided when two of the unions joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), and the other joined the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). The unions fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

A solar eclipse occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring).

An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring).

The first official response to the economic support being given to the United States military from the government was by [[Lester B.

On April 2, 1965, Pearson gave a speech at [[Temple University]] in the United States which, in the context of firm support for U.S. policy, called for a pause in the bombing of North Vietnam. In a perhaps apocryphal story, when a furious [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

In Canada unemployment fell to record low levels of 3.9%\".<ref name=\"Vietnam War\"/>\n\nAlthough these exports were sales by Canadian companies, not gifts from the Canadian government, they benefited the American war effort nonetheless. The first official response to the economic support being given to the United States military from the government was by [[Lester B. Pearson]] on March 10, 1967 that the export of goods to their southern ally was \"necessary and logical\" due to the extreme integration of both economies, and that an embargo would also be a notice of withdrawal from North American defense arrangements.<ref>\"Thakur, Ramesh C.(1984).

On April 2, 1965, Pearson gave a speech at [[Temple University]] in the United States which, in the context of firm support for U.S. policy, called for a pause in the bombing of North Vietnam. In a perhaps apocryphal story, when a furious [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

After this incident, the two men somehow found ways to resolve their differences over the war\u2014in fact, they both had further contacts, including later twice meeting in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Lawrence|title=The Presidents and the Prime Ministers|url=https://archive.org/details/presidentsprimem0000mart|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n== Assistance to the U.S. war effort ==\n\n[[File:DHC-4 Caribou Vietnam.jpg|thumb |upright=1.2 |right |alt=Large airplane descending over tarpaulin-covered area |A [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]] transport plane on landing approach, Vietnam War, 1971.]]\nCanada's official diplomatic position in relation to the Vietnam War was that of a non-belligerent, which imposed a ban on the export of war-related items to the combat areas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Nonetheless, Canadian industry was also a major supplier of equipment and supplies to the American forces, not sending these directly to [[South Vietnam]] but to the United States.

One informed estimate puts their number between 30,000 and 40,000.<ref name=\"knowles\"/> Whether or not this estimate is accurate, the fact remains that emigration from the United States was high as long as America was involved militarily in the war and maintained compulsory military service; in 1971 and 1972 Canada received more immigrants from the United States than from any other country.<ref name=\"knowles\"/>\n\n=== Draft evaders ===\n{{main|Draft evasion}}\n[[File:Draft dodgers being counseled 1967.jpg|thumb |upright=1.2 |right |alt=Five young people sitting and talking intently |[[Mark Satin]] (left) counseling American Vietnam War evaders at the Anti-Draft Programme office in Toronto, 1967.]]\nEstimates vary greatly as to how many Americans settled in Canada for the specific reason of dodging the draft or \"evading [[conscription]],\" as opposed to desertion, or other reasons.
