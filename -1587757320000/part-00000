Martin, [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Martin Short]] star as the title characters, three [[silent film]] stars who are mistaken for real heroes by the suffering people of a small Mexican village.  They must find a way to live up to their reputation and stop a marauding bandit.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1916, the bandit \"El Guapo\" and his gang are collecting protection money from the Mexican village of Santo Poco. Carmen, daughter of the village leader, searches for someone who can come to the rescue of her townspeople. While visiting a village church, she sees a silent film featuring \"The Three Amigos\", a trio of gunfighters that protect the innocent from evildoers. Believing them to be real heroes, Carmen sends a telegram asking them to come and stop El Guapo.\n\nLucky Day, Dusty Bottoms, and Ned Nederlander are silent film actors from Los Angeles, California, who portray the Amigos on screen. When they demand a salary increase, studio executive Harry Flugleman fires them. Shortly afterward, they receive Carmen's telegram but misinterpret it as an invitation to appear in character and perform for the people of Santo Poco.\n\nAfter breaking into the studio to retrieve their costumes, the Amigos head for Mexico. Stopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot, who arrived just before they did and is also looking for El Guapo. The Amigos perform a show at the Cantina, singing \"My Little Buttercup\", and leave the locals bemused. The German's real associates then arrive at the cantina, proving themselves adept with their pistols when everyone else laughs at them. A relieved Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are put up in the best house in town and treated very well.\n\nThe next morning, when three of El Guapo's men come to raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men very confused. The bandits ride off, making everyone think that the Amigos have defeated the enemy. In reality, the men inform El Guapo of what has happened, and he decides to return the next day and kill the Amigos.\n\nThe village throws a boisterous celebration for the Amigos and their victory. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call out the Amigos, but the Amigos think this is another show. After Lucky gets shot in the arm, the Amigos realize that these are real bandits and hysterically beg for mercy. El Guapo allows the Amigos to live then has his men loot the village and kidnap Carmen. The Amigos leave Santo Poco in disgrace.\n\nNed persuades Lucky and Dusty to go after El Guapo, saying that they have nothing worth going back to in America and this is their chance to be real heroes. They spot a cargo plane and follow it; the plane is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for the gang. Preparations are underway for El Guapo's 40th birthday party, and he plans to make Carmen his bride. The Amigos try to sneak into the hideout, with mixed results: Lucky is captured and chained up in a dungeon, Dusty crashes through a window into Carmen's room, and Ned ends up stuck hanging from a [[pi\u00f1ata]].\n\nLucky frees himself, but Dusty and Ned are caught. The German, having idolized Ned's quick-draw and gun spinning pistol skills since childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned kills the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape in the German's plane.\n\nReturning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves. Drawing inspiration from one of their old films, they have the villagers create improvised Amigos costumes. The bandits arrive, only to find themselves suddenly being shot at by Amigos from all sides and falling into hidden trenches dug by the villagers. El Guapo's men either ride off or are shot, and he takes a fatal wound as well. As he lies dying, the villagers, all dressed as Amigos, step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them, then shoots Lucky in the foot and dies.\n\nThe villagers offer to give the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse it, saying (as in their movies) that \"seeing justice done is enough of a reward for them\". They then turn around and ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Lucky Day\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Dusty Bottoms\n* [[Martin Short]] as Ned Nederlander\n* [[Alfonso Arau]] as El Guapo\n* [[Tony Plana]] as Jefe\n* [[Patrice Martinez]] as Carmen\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Harry Flugleman\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as Sam, one of Flugleman's assistants\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Morty, one of Flugleman's assistants\n* [[Tino Insana]] as The Studio Guard\n* Loyda Ramos as Conchita\n* Phillip Gordon as Rodrigo\n* [[Kai Wulff]] as the German \n* [[Norbert Weisser]] and [[Brian Thompson]] as the German's friends\n* [[Randy Newman]] as the Singing Bush\n* [[Rebecca Ferratti|Rebecca Underwood]] as Hot Senorita (kisses Ned at the close of the film)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by Martin, Michaels, and [[Randy Newman]].

He has won multiple awards and has been described as the \"[[John Williams]] of [[video game music]]\" and \"a model of success\" for Western composers. He has composed soundtracks for over 60 games and over a dozen other works during his career. He is best known for his work in ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars]]'' series, and several other top-selling titles such as ''[[Total Annihilation]]'', ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'', ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', ''[[Dungeon Siege]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter video games|Harry Potter]]''.\n\nAfter several years of private [[Musical composition|composition]] studies he became an employee of [[Square (video game company)|Square]] in 1994. After finishing the soundtrack to ''[[Secret of Evermore]]'' in 1995, he left to join [[Humongous Entertainment]], where he composed for several children's games as well as ''Total Annihilation'', his first award-winning score. In 2000, he left to form his own music production company, ''Soule Media'', now called ''Artistry Entertainment''. Through the company, Soule has created several award-winning soundtracks, including ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' series of games, and all of the main ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' games since 2002.\n\nIn 2005, he founded DirectSong, a record label that publishes digital [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free versions of his soundtracks as well as those of classical composers. Soule's works have been played in several live concerts such as the [[Symphonic Game Music Concert]] in Germany and the international ''[[Play! A Video Game Symphony]]'' concert series. While many of his works are [[orchestral]], he considers himself a \"music practitioner\", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music. Several of Soule's soundtracks have been created with the help of his brother, Julian. \n\n==Early life==\nSoule is of [[Jewish descent]] and was born in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] to a public school music teacher father and a graphic designer mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras at the age of five.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/><ref name=\"IGNint\"/><ref name=\"GBJSoule\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/jeremy-soule/72-17632|title=Jeremy Soule|publisher=Giant Bomb|accessdate=January 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909214530/http://www.giantbomb.com/jeremy-soule/72-17632/|archive-date=September 9, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from [[Western Illinois University]] when he was in sixth grade.<ref name=\"GSint\"/><ref name=\"GWVint\"/> He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in [[Musical composition|composition]] before completing high school; however, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both.<ref name=\"IGNint\"/>\n\nWhile playing video games as a child, Soule came to believe that the experience they created could be greatly enhanced by having a better musical score.<ref name=\"IGNint\"/> After completing high school, he took a year to create a portfolio showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like. Soule sent the tape to [[LucasArts]] and [[Square (video game company)|Square]]. Square very much appreciated the portfolio; he does not believe that LucasArts ever listened to his tapes as they had a \"no unsolicited package\" policy.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> Soule began working at Square in [[Seattle]] only two weeks after first submitting his demo tapes.<ref name=\"IGNint\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1990s===\nSoule was promptly given the task by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] to score ''[[Secret of Evermore]]''. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) into the music and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> Part of the reason for this was that the sound program used in ''Evermore'' was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> When [[Ron Gilbert]] of LucasArts left to form his own company, [[Humongous Entertainment]], and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, ''[[Putt-Putt (game character)|Putt-Putt]]''; he was the company's third employee.<ref name=\"UGOint\"/> Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the ''Putt-Putt'', ''[[Pajama Sam]]'', ''[[Freddi Fish]]'' and ''[[Spy Fox]]'' series.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/>\n\nWhile working at Humongous, Soule met fellow employee and video game designer [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], and signed on to compose the soundtrack to his major project, ''[[Total Annihilation]]''. Soule convinced Taylor that, given the large number of other [[real-time strategy]] games coming out at the same time as ''Total Annihilation'' with [[techno]] scores, that to separate themselves they needed to do a large orchestral score. He went so far as to bet a year's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/><ref name=\"GSint\"/> Given the software limitations at the time, to make the sound work correctly required a full live orchestra, the first that Soule had ever worked with; the orchestral tracks in ''Evermore'' had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves, two instruments at a time.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> The soundtrack earned Soule his first award, that of \"Best Music\" of 1997 from [[GameSpot]] in their year-end awards.<ref name=\"GS1997award\"/> Soule spent the next two years composing music for the game's two expansion packs and for children's games.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/>\n\n===2000s===\nIn February 2000, Jeremy and his brother, Julian, formed Soule Media as an independent music production company; its name has since been changed to Artistry Entertainment.<ref name=\"SOULEpageold\"/> Julian works as a sound engineer and composer for the company, and has assisted Jeremy in several projects throughout his career, both credited and uncredited.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/><ref name=\"IGNint\"/> The first large project that Jeremy Soule worked on through the company was 2000's ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', which won the best music of the year award from both [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\"IGN2000award\"/><ref name=\"GS2000award\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Soule scored the first of five ''[[Harry Potter]]'' games that he would work on between then and 2005. His first game, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\", while ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' won and were nominated, respectively, for a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy of Film & Television Arts]] award for \"Best Score\" in the Game Music Category.<ref name=\"AIAS2001\"/><ref name=\"BAFTA2003\"/><ref name=\"BAFTA2004\"/> The other games he composed for that year include ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'' and ''[[Azurik: Rise of Perathia]]'', which he later described as a bad game lifted up in the eyes of testers and reviewers by good music.<ref name=\"GSUKint\"/> He was responsible for composing the soundtracks to three top-selling role-playing games in 2002, those of ''[[Dungeon Siege]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''; ''Morrowind'' earned him his second Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award nomination.<ref name=\"AIAS2002\"/>\n\nSince then Artistry Entertainment has grown and scored a string of highly successful games such as the ''[[Guild Wars]]'' series, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/> ''Oblivion'' was an award-winning soundtrack by Soule. It was nominated for the 2006 British Academy of Film & Television Arts and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards, and won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video Game Score|MTV Video Music Awards]] and [[Official Xbox Magazine]] soundtrack awards.<ref name=\"BAFTA2006\"/><ref name=\"AIAS2007\"/><ref name=\"MTVVMA2006\"/><ref name=\"OXM2006\"/> In 2005, Jeremy and Julian Soule founded DirectSong, a company which sells [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free downloads of Jeremy's compositions as well as works by dozens of classical composers. By 2007 the company had grown to over one million registered customers, though Soule noted that not all of those customers resulted in a sale of a non-free product.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/>  Soule says that the traffic numbers for DirectSong have surpassed some major record labels at times.<ref name=\"GSUKint\"/> DirectSong has also struggled to fulfil orders or provide timely support, with some customers sometimes waiting more than a year for CDs, resulting in an \"F\" rating by the Better Business Bureau, based on 58 complaints.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Better Business Bureau | title = DirectSong Business Review in Lake Stevens, WA | url = http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/compact-discs-tapes-and-records-retail/directsong-in-lake-stevens-wa-22685930 | accessdate = November 28, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005508/http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/compact-discs-tapes-and-records-retail/directsong-in-lake-stevens-wa-22685930 | archive-date = December 3, 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Soule composed music for the first ''[[Guild Wars]]'' title, and would ultimately go on to compose music for all expansions for the first game, as well as the soundtrack for ''[[Guild Wars 2]]''. Soule also uses DirectSong to sell \"expansion packs\" of music for games such as ''Guild Wars'' that can be played in game like the rest of the soundtrack. He estimates that at least 10% of the players of ''Guild Wars'' have bought his musical expansion for the game, ''Battle Pak 1''.

Accessed November 3, 2016.</ref> Soule's music has been featured in numerous top-selling games; he once estimated in an interview that around 10 million games with his music in them were sold in 2006 alone.<ref name=\"Pronounce\"/>\n\nSelections of remixes of Soule's work appear on English remixing websites such as [[OverClocked ReMix]].<ref name=\"OCR\"/> Soule is a supporter of the game music arrangement community, even going so far as to submit his own [[arrangement]] to OverClocked ReMix. He did so to help promote and inspire younger and newer composers. The track, \"Squaresoft Variation\", arranges the ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' piece \"Terra\"; Soule has said that he chose the piece to remix because when he first started at Square he spent some time debugging the game before his composition duties for ''Evermore'' started.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/><ref name=\"Squaresoft Variation\"/>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nSoule rarely gets to see the game he is composing for in any sort of completed state before he begins work; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company's previous games. He credits his success with this strategy to the fact that many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature, such as a [[role-playing game]].<ref name=\"IGNint\"/> He also likes to see the storyboards and concept art for the game, as he considers them a good provider of \"pure emotional intent\" for the game.<ref name=\"GWVint\"/> When composing a soundtrack, the first thing that he decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> After that, Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack, to make sure that they match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> Soule tries to compose all of a game's soundtrack himself rather than in a team, though he sometimes collaborates with his brother.<ref name=\"GWVint\"/>\n\nAlthough many of his works are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his \"style\", as he feels that the term boxes him into only creating one type of music. He prefers to call himself a \"music practitioner\", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as he is capable of many styles, such as [[J-pop|Japanese pop]], which he has written along with [[Jeff Miyahara]]. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if you understand the structure.<ref name=\"RPGFint\"/> He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for \"ambitious\" games by people with \"new ideas\".<ref name=\"GSUKint\"/>\n\nSoule's greatest musical influences are \"[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s exploration of harmony\", \"[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s grand operas\", and \"[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s form and composition\".<ref name=\"IGNint\"/> While many of his orchestral works are based on [[Film score|movie scores]] in terms of scope, he does not often listen to movie scores, though he names his favorite composer as [[John Williams]].<ref name=\"IGNint\"/><ref name=\"GSint\"/> The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule \"the John Williams of video game music\".<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> Among [[video game music]] influences, he has cited [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for providing him \"with the education for what quality means to this business\" and [[Nobuo Uematsu]] in particular.<ref name=\"RPGFint\"/> His favorite style of music to listen to is [[Britpop|British pop]] and rock music, while his favorite video games are the ones that he has written scores to, especially the ones made by [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], though one of his all-time favorites is ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. He has said that the games he would most like to work on that he has not already are ones by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game, and a ''[[Metroid]]'' game.<ref name=\"GSint\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Video games===\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Secret of Evermore]]'' (1995) - with Julian Soule\n*''Freddi Fish & Luther's Maze Madness'' (1996)\n*''Freddi Fish & Luther's Water Worries'' (1996)\n*''[[Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside]]'' (1996)\n*''Putt-Putt and Pep's Dog On a Stick'' (1996)\n*''Putt-Putt Travels Through Time'' (1997)\n*''[[Total Annihilation]]'' (1997)\n*''Pajama Sam's SockWorks'' (1997)\n*''Young Dilbert Hi-Tech Hijinks'' (1997)\n*''[[Spy Fox in \"Dry Cereal\"]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Total Annihilation: Core Contingency]]'' (1998)\n*''Pajama Sam: Lost and Found'' (1998)\n*''[[Spy Fox|Spy Fox in Cheese Chase]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Total Annihilation: Kingdoms]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Icewind Dale]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Giants: Citizen Kabuto]]'' (2000)\n*''Rugrats: Totally Angelica Boredom Buster'' (2000)\n*''[[Amen: The Awakening]]'' (cancelled in 2000)\n*''Beauty and the Beast'' (2000)\n*''[[Total Annihilation: Kingdoms#The Iron Plague|Total Annihilation: Kingdoms- The Iron Plague]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Rugrats in Paris: the Movie (video game)|Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Azurik: Rise of Perathia]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'' (2001)\n*''Final Four 2002'' (2001)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Dungeon Siege]]'' (2002)\n*''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Natural Selection (computer game)|Natural Selection]]'' (2002)\n*''[[The Magic School Bus merchandise|Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' (2002)\n*''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'' (2002)\n*''[[EverQuest Online Adventures]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Sovereign (game)|Sovereign]]'' (canceled in 2003)\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Unreal II]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Impossible Creatures]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Armies of Exigo]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (video game)|Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Kohan II: Kings of War]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Guild Wars Prophecies]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Dungeon Siege II]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Company of Heroes]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Warhammer: Mark of Chaos]]'' (2006)\n*''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Prey (computer game)|Prey]]'' (2006) - with Julian Soule\n*''[[Guild Wars Factions]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Guild Wars Nightfall]]'' (2006) - with Julian Soule\n*''[[Guild Wars: Eye of the North]]'' (2007) - with Julian Soule\n*''[[Supreme Commander Official Soundtrack|Supreme Commander]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance]]'' (2007)\n*''[[IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Order of War]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Gaia Online#zOMG|zOMG!]]'' (2009) (music later reused in ''Monster Galaxy''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/zOMG/posts/143825365752866|title=zOMG!

He has won multiple awards and has been described as the \"[[John Williams]] of [[video game music]]\" and \"a model of success\" for Western composers. He has composed soundtracks for over 60 games and over a dozen other works during his career. He is best known for his work in ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars]]'' series, and several other top-selling titles such as ''[[Total Annihilation]]'', ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'', ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', ''[[Dungeon Siege]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter video games|Harry Potter]]''.\n\nAfter several years of private [[Musical composition|composition]] studies he became an employee of [[Square (video game company)|Square]] in 1994. After finishing the soundtrack to ''[[Secret of Evermore]]'' in 1995, he left to join [[Humongous Entertainment]], where he composed for several children's games as well as ''Total Annihilation'', his first award-winning score. In 2000, he left to form his own music production company, ''Soule Media'', now called ''Artistry Entertainment''. Through the company, Soule has created several award-winning soundtracks, including ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' series of games, and all of the main ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' games since 2002.\n\nIn 2005, he founded DirectSong, a record label that publishes digital [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free versions of his soundtracks as well as those of classical composers. Soule's works have been played in several live concerts such as the [[Symphonic Game Music Concert]] in Germany and the international ''[[Play! A Video Game Symphony]]'' concert series. While many of his works are [[orchestral]], he considers himself a \"music practitioner\", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music. Several of Soule's soundtracks have been created with the help of his brother, Julian. In August 2019, Soule was accused of rape and sexual harassment, but denied the accusations with no charges being pressed.\n\n==Early life==\nSoule is of [[Jewish descent]] and was born in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] to a public school music teacher father and a graphic designer mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras at the age of five.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/><ref name=\"IGNint\"/><ref name=\"GBJSoule\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/jeremy-soule/72-17632|title=Jeremy Soule|publisher=Giant Bomb|accessdate=January 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909214530/http://www.giantbomb.com/jeremy-soule/72-17632/|archive-date=September 9, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from [[Western Illinois University]] when he was in sixth grade.<ref name=\"GSint\"/><ref name=\"GWVint\"/> He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in [[Musical composition|composition]] before completing high school; however, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both.<ref name=\"IGNint\"/>\n\nWhile playing video games as a child, Soule came to believe that the experience they created could be greatly enhanced by having a better musical score.<ref name=\"IGNint\"/> After completing high school, he took a year to create a portfolio showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like. Soule sent the tape to [[LucasArts]] and [[Square (video game company)|Square]]. Square very much appreciated the portfolio; he does not believe that LucasArts ever listened to his tapes as they had a \"no unsolicited package\" policy.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> Soule began working at Square in [[Seattle]] only two weeks after first submitting his demo tapes.<ref name=\"IGNint\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===1990s===\nSoule was promptly given the task by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] to score ''[[Secret of Evermore]]''. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) into the music and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> Part of the reason for this was that the sound program used in ''Evermore'' was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> When [[Ron Gilbert]] of LucasArts left to form his own company, [[Humongous Entertainment]], and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, ''[[Putt-Putt (game character)|Putt-Putt]]''; he was the company's third employee.<ref name=\"UGOint\"/> Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the ''Putt-Putt'', ''[[Pajama Sam]]'', ''[[Freddi Fish]]'' and ''[[Spy Fox]]'' series.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/>\n\nWhile working at Humongous, Soule met fellow employee and video game designer [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], and signed on to compose the soundtrack to his major project, ''[[Total Annihilation]]''. Soule convinced Taylor that, given the large number of other [[real-time strategy]] games coming out at the same time as ''Total Annihilation'' with [[techno]] scores, that to separate themselves they needed to do a large orchestral score. He went so far as to bet a year's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/><ref name=\"GSint\"/> Given the software limitations at the time, to make the sound work correctly required a full live orchestra, the first that Soule had ever worked with; the orchestral tracks in ''Evermore'' had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves, two instruments at a time.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> The soundtrack earned Soule his first award, that of \"Best Music\" of 1997 from [[GameSpot]] in their year-end awards.<ref name=\"GS1997award\"/> Soule spent the next two years composing music for the game's two expansion packs and for children's games.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/>\n\n===2000s===\nIn February 2000, Jeremy and his brother, Julian, formed Soule Media as an independent music production company; its name has since been changed to Artistry Entertainment.<ref name=\"SOULEpageold\"/> Julian works as a sound engineer and composer for the company, and has assisted Jeremy in several projects throughout his career, both credited and uncredited.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/><ref name=\"IGNint\"/> The first large project that Jeremy Soule worked on through the company was 2000's ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', which won the best music of the year award from both [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\"IGN2000award\"/><ref name=\"GS2000award\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Soule scored the first of five ''[[Harry Potter]]'' games that he would work on between then and 2005. His first game, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\", while ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' won and were nominated, respectively, for a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy of Film & Television Arts]] award for \"Best Score\" in the Game Music Category.<ref name=\"AIAS2001\"/><ref name=\"BAFTA2003\"/><ref name=\"BAFTA2004\"/> The other games he composed for that year include ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'' and ''[[Azurik: Rise of Perathia]]'', which he later described as a bad game lifted up in the eyes of testers and reviewers by good music.<ref name=\"GSUKint\"/> He was responsible for composing the soundtracks to three top-selling role-playing games in 2002, those of ''[[Dungeon Siege]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''; ''Morrowind'' earned him his second Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award nomination.<ref name=\"AIAS2002\"/>\n\nSince then Artistry Entertainment has grown and scored a string of highly successful games such as the ''[[Guild Wars]]'' series, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/> ''Oblivion'' was an award-winning soundtrack by Soule. It was nominated for the 2006 British Academy of Film & Television Arts and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards, and won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video Game Score|MTV Video Music Awards]] and [[Official Xbox Magazine]] soundtrack awards.<ref name=\"BAFTA2006\"/><ref name=\"AIAS2007\"/><ref name=\"MTVVMA2006\"/><ref name=\"OXM2006\"/> In 2005, Jeremy and Julian Soule founded DirectSong, a company which sells [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free downloads of Jeremy's compositions as well as works by dozens of classical composers. By 2007 the company had grown to over one million registered customers, though Soule noted that not all of those customers resulted in a sale of a non-free product.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/>  Soule says that the traffic numbers for DirectSong have surpassed some major record labels at times.<ref name=\"GSUKint\"/> DirectSong has also struggled to fulfil orders or provide timely support, with some customers sometimes waiting more than a year for CDs, resulting in an \"F\" rating by the Better Business Bureau, based on 58 complaints.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Better Business Bureau | title = DirectSong Business Review in Lake Stevens, WA | url = http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/compact-discs-tapes-and-records-retail/directsong-in-lake-stevens-wa-22685930 | accessdate = November 28, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005508/http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/compact-discs-tapes-and-records-retail/directsong-in-lake-stevens-wa-22685930 | archive-date = December 3, 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Soule composed music for the first ''[[Guild Wars]]'' title, and would ultimately go on to compose music for all expansions for the first game, as well as the soundtrack for ''[[Guild Wars 2]]''. Soule also uses DirectSong to sell \"expansion packs\" of music for games such as ''Guild Wars'' that can be played in game like the rest of the soundtrack. He estimates that at least 10% of the players of ''Guild Wars'' have bought his musical expansion for the game, ''Battle Pak 1''. Soule also worked on another of Chris Taylor's real-time strategy titles in 2007, with the launch of ''[[Supreme Commander (game)|Supreme Commander]]''.<ref name=\"SOULEsite\"/>\n\n===2010s===\n{{update|date=November 2018}}\nNovember 2011 saw the release of the fifth installment in the ''Elder Scrolls'' franchise, ''[[Skyrim]]''. The game's soundtrack is among Soule's most critically acclaimed pieces of work, receiving a BAFTA nomination as well as numerous other awards from organizations such as the Game Audio Network Guild.<ref name=\"BAFTA2012\"/> Soule would also go on to compose the music for two of the official DLC packs for the game, ''Dragonborn'' and ''Dawnguard'', both released in 2012.\n\nIn March 2013, Soule launched a [[Kickstarter]] project to fund a classical music album called ''The Northerner: Soule Symphony No. 1'', seeking $10,000 for the album.<ref name=\"kickstarter\"/> The campaign ultimately raised a total of $121,227.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1|title=From the Composer of Skyrim - Soule Symphony No. 1|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306152712/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The project features vocals in [[Old Norse]], with Soule citing the successful use of the similar [[Icelandic language]] by [[Malukah]] in one of her own projects during development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/835364|title=From the Composer of Skyrim - Soule Symphony No. 1 by Max Steiner Agency Inc. \u2014 Kickstarter|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307192940/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/835364|archive-date=March 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> For the project, Soule and his company are developing new audio technology.<ref name=\"kickstarter.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/1500157|title=From the Composer of Skyrim - Soule Symphony No. 1 by Max Steiner Agency Inc. \u2014 Kickstarter|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401131501/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/1500157|archive-date=April 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2019|12}} the symphony has no expected release date, having missed all prior announced dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/11/four-and-a-half-years-after-raising-159000-skyrim-composers-kickstarter-is-mia/|title=Four And A Half Years After Raising $159,000, Skyrim Composer's Kickstarter Is MIA|work=Kotaku|date=2017-11-29|accessdate=2019-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222160333/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/11/four-and-a-half-years-after-raising-159000-skyrim-composers-kickstarter-is-mia/|archive-date=December 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/14/jeremy-soule-kickstarter-northerner-symphony-release/ |title=Why is Skyrim composer Jeremy Soule\u2019s $121,227 Kickstarter symphony still not finished five years later? |work=VG247.com |date=2019-01-14 |accessdate=2019-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704160312/https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/14/jeremy-soule-kickstarter-northerner-symphony-release/ |archive-date=July 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Soule signed an MMO exclusivity deal with [[Sony Online Entertainment]], in order to compose music for ''[[Everquest Next]]'' and ''[[Landmark (video game)|Landmark]]''.

He did so to help promote and inspire younger and newer composers. The track, \"Squaresoft Variation\", arranges the ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' piece \"Terra\"; Soule has said that he chose the piece to remix because when he first started at Square he spent some time debugging the game before his composition duties for ''Evermore'' started.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/><ref name=\"Squaresoft Variation\"/>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nSoule rarely gets to see the game he is composing for in any sort of completed state before he begins work; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company's previous games. He credits his success with this strategy to the fact that many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature, such as a [[role-playing game]].<ref name=\"IGNint\"/> He also likes to see the storyboards and concept art for the game, as he considers them a good provider of \"pure emotional intent\" for the game.<ref name=\"GWVint\"/> When composing a soundtrack, the first thing that he decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game.<ref name=\"GSint\"/> After that, Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack, to make sure that they match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes.<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> Soule tries to compose all of a game's soundtrack himself rather than in a team, though he sometimes collaborates with his brother.<ref name=\"GWVint\"/>\n\nAlthough many of his works are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his \"style\", as he feels that the term boxes him into only creating one type of music. He prefers to call himself a \"music practitioner\", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as he is capable of many styles, such as [[J-pop|Japanese pop]], which he has written along with [[Jeff Miyahara]]. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if you understand the structure.<ref name=\"RPGFint\"/> He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for \"ambitious\" games by people with \"new ideas\".<ref name=\"GSUKint\"/>\n\nSoule's greatest musical influences are \"[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s exploration of harmony\", \"[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s grand operas\", and \"[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s form and composition\".<ref name=\"IGNint\"/> While many of his orchestral works are based on [[Film score|movie scores]] in terms of scope, he does not often listen to movie scores, though he names his favorite composer as [[John Williams]].<ref name=\"IGNint\"/><ref name=\"GSint\"/> The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule \"the John Williams of video game music\".<ref name=\"M4Gint\"/> Among [[video game music]] influences, he has cited [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for providing him \"with the education for what quality means to this business\" and [[Nobuo Uematsu]] in particular.<ref name=\"RPGFint\"/> His favorite style of music to listen to is [[Britpop|British pop]] and rock music, while his favorite video games are the ones that he has written scores to, especially the ones made by [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], though one of his all-time favorites is ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. He has said that the games he would most like to work on that he has not already are ones by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game, and a ''[[Metroid]]'' game.<ref name=\"GSint\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Video games===\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Secret of Evermore]]'' (1995) - with Julian Soule\n*''Freddi Fish & Luther's Maze Madness'' (1996)\n*''Freddi Fish & Luther's Water Worries'' (1996)\n*''[[Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside]]'' (1996)\n*''Putt-Putt and Pep's Dog On a Stick'' (1996)\n*''Putt-Putt Travels Through Time'' (1997)\n*''[[Total Annihilation]]'' (1997)\n*''Pajama Sam's SockWorks'' (1997)\n*''Young Dilbert Hi-Tech Hijinks'' (1997)\n*''[[Spy Fox in \"Dry Cereal\"]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Total Annihilation: Core Contingency]]'' (1998)\n*''Pajama Sam: Lost and Found'' (1998)\n*''[[Spy Fox|Spy Fox in Cheese Chase]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Total Annihilation: Kingdoms]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Icewind Dale]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Giants: Citizen Kabuto]]'' (2000)\n*''Rugrats: Totally Angelica Boredom Buster'' (2000)\n*''[[Amen: The Awakening]]'' (cancelled in 2000)\n*''Beauty and the Beast'' (2000)\n*''[[Total Annihilation: Kingdoms#The Iron Plague|Total Annihilation: Kingdoms- The Iron Plague]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Rugrats in Paris: the Movie (video game)|Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Azurik: Rise of Perathia]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'' (2001)\n*''Final Four 2002'' (2001)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Dungeon Siege]]'' (2002)\n*''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Natural Selection (computer game)|Natural Selection]]'' (2002)\n*''[[The Magic School Bus merchandise|Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' (2002)\n*''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'' (2002)\n*''[[EverQuest Online Adventures]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Sovereign (game)|Sovereign]]'' (canceled in 2003)\n*''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Unreal II]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Impossible Creatures]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Armies of Exigo]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (video game)|Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Kohan II: Kings of War]]'' (2004)\n*''[[Guild Wars Prophecies]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Dungeon Siege II]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Company of Heroes]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Warhammer: Mark of Chaos]]'' (2006)\n*''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Prey (computer game)|Prey]]'' (2006) - with Julian Soule\n*''[[Guild Wars Factions]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Guild Wars Nightfall]]'' (2006) - with Julian Soule\n*''[[Guild Wars: Eye of the North]]'' (2007) - with Julian Soule\n*''[[Supreme Commander Official Soundtrack|Supreme Commander]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance]]'' (2007)\n*''[[IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Order of War]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Gaia Online#zOMG|zOMG!]]'' (2009) (music later reused in ''Monster Galaxy''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/zOMG/posts/143825365752866|title=zOMG!

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a weird figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East asian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|'' Nautilus'']] and cruising the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, also that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo died when he was murdered by Arronax onboard the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes\u2014\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I recognize no superiors! Here I'm free!<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Frederick Paul Walter |title=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas |wslink=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (Walter)/Chapter 10 |origyear=1870 |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-43844-663-9 |noicon=yes}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:20000 graveyard.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo standing over the crew of the ''Nautilus'' as they observe an underwater funeral]]\n\nNemo is devoted to his crew and grieves deeply when one is killed in the [[giant squid]] attack in the [[Caribbean Sea]], or after a midnight encounter with a surface ship. He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo acts as an agent of [[Divine Providence]], as when the sailor Pencroff laments the absence of [[tobacco]], and a hunting party discover a plant that the young naturalist Harbert identifies as such. The other castaways keep the discovery secret until they can dry and cure the leaves. One evening, Pencroff is offered some coffee by his friends. When he declines, they say, \"A pipe, then?\" and produce a homemade pipe stuffed full, with a coal to light it. Pencroff exclaims, \"O, divine Providence! sacred Author of all things!&nbsp;... Nothing more is now wanting to our island\".<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Agnes Kinloch Kingston |title=The Mysterious Island |wslink=The Mysterious Island/Part 2/Chapter 10 |origyear=1874 |year=1875 |noicon=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Emblem ==\n\nHis emblem, as given in a description of the flag he raised when claiming [[Antarctica]], is a large golden '''''N''''' on a black field. The motto of the ''Nautilus'' was ''Mobilis in mobili'', which may be roughly translated from Latin as, \"moving amidst mobility\", \"moving within the moving element\", or \"changing in the changes\".\n\n[[File:20000 mobilis in mobili.jpg|center|thumb|The [[motto]] of the ''Nautilus'']]\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn the initial draft of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', Nemo was a [[szlachcic|Polish noble]], a member of the [[szlachta]], resenting the murder of his family during the Russian repression of the [[January Uprising]]; but Verne's editor [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] feared a book ban in the Russian market and offending a French ally, the [[Russian Empire]], and had Verne obscure Nemo's motivation in the first book.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mike |last=Perschon |url=http://www.verniana.org/volumes/02/A4/Perschon.pdf |title=Finding Nemo: Verne's Antihero as Original Steampunk |journal=Verniana: Jules Verne Studies |volume=2 |date=February 1, 2010 |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Jess |last=Nevins |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Victoriana |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=Monkeybrain Books |year=2005 |page=128 |isbn=978-1-93226-515-6}}</ref> In the second book of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea'', Nemo comes close to revealing his Indian ancestry, though this is not obvious except in retrospect, where he saves a [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] pearl-fisher in the [[Gulf of Mannar]].\n\n=== Chronological inconsistency ===\n\n''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was written between 1869 and 1870 and records the voyages of the ''Nautilus'' between 1866 and 1868. ''The Mysterious Island'' was written in 1874 but is set immediately after the [[American Civil War]], from 1861 to 1865. This would mean that Captain Nemo who appeared in ''The Mysterious Island'' dies ''before'' Captain Nemo who appeared in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' sets out on the undersea travels. Also, when Captain Nemo is finally seen in ''The Mysterious Island'', he mentions having met Aronnax 16 years previously.\n\nMany errors in the original French first printing (the 'grand in-8' published by [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]]) are likely the fault of the editors who, at that time, were unlikely to consult the authors of the books they edited before making a change.  According to the new, full translation put out by the [[Naval Institute Press]], nearly all errors can be attributed to the editors, with only a few being the fault of Jules Verne, who was otherwise meticulous.  The inconsistency of the dates between ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' is perhaps evidence in this argument, as it seems unlikely that Verne would make such an obvious gaffe.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' goes down in the [[Maelstrom]] on June 2, 1868, according to ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', but may have survived. (''The Mysterious Island'' gives this date as June 22, 1867.) Captain Nemo dies on the ''Nautilus'' under Lincoln Island in ''The Mysterious Island'' on October 15, 1868. Therefore, some chronological inconsistencies still exist: Cyrus and Gideon knew of Captain Nemo years before Aronnax published his story, Nemo being trapped under Lincoln Island all during the time in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn most subsequent media adaptations of ''20,000 Leagues'' and ''Mysterious Island'', Nemo is (in a deviation from Verne's novels) depicted as a European.

Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, also that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes\u2014\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I recognize no superiors! Here I'm free!<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Frederick Paul Walter |title=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas |wslink=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (Walter)/Chapter 10 |origyear=1870 |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-43844-663-9 |noicon=yes}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:20000 graveyard.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo standing over the crew of the ''Nautilus'' as they observe an underwater funeral]]\n\nNemo is devoted to his crew and grieves deeply when one is killed in the [[giant squid]] attack in the [[Caribbean Sea]], or after a midnight encounter with a surface ship. He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo acts as an agent of [[Divine Providence]], as when the sailor Pencroff laments the absence of [[tobacco]], and a hunting party discover a plant that the young naturalist Harbert identifies as such. The other castaways keep the discovery secret until they can dry and cure the leaves. One evening, Pencroff is offered some coffee by his friends. When he declines, they say, \"A pipe, then?\" and produce a homemade pipe stuffed full, with a coal to light it. Pencroff exclaims, \"O, divine Providence! sacred Author of all things!&nbsp;... Nothing more is now wanting to our island\".<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Agnes Kinloch Kingston |title=The Mysterious Island |wslink=The Mysterious Island/Part 2/Chapter 10 |origyear=1874 |year=1875 |noicon=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Emblem ==\n\nHis emblem, as given in a description of the flag he raised when claiming [[Antarctica]], is a large golden '''''N''''' on a black field. The motto of the ''Nautilus'' was ''Mobilis in mobili'', which may be roughly translated from Latin as, \"moving amidst mobility\", \"moving within the moving element\", or \"changing in the changes\".\n\n[[File:20000 mobilis in mobili.jpg|center|thumb|The [[motto]] of the ''Nautilus'']]\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn the initial draft of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', Nemo was a [[szlachcic|Polish noble]], a member of the [[szlachta]], resenting the murder of his family during the Russian repression of the [[January Uprising]]; but Verne's editor [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] feared a book ban in the Russian market and offending a French ally, the [[Russian Empire]], and had Verne obscure Nemo's motivation in the first book.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mike |last=Perschon |url=http://www.verniana.org/volumes/02/A4/Perschon.pdf |title=Finding Nemo: Verne's Antihero as Original Steampunk |journal=Verniana: Jules Verne Studies |volume=2 |date=February 1, 2010 |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Jess |last=Nevins |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Victoriana |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=Monkeybrain Books |year=2005 |page=128 |isbn=978-1-93226-515-6}}</ref> In the second book of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea'', Nemo comes close to revealing his Indian ancestry, though this is not obvious except in retrospect, where he saves a [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] pearl-fisher in the [[Gulf of Mannar]].\n\n=== Chronological inconsistency ===\n\n''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' was written between 1869 and 1870 and records the voyages of the ''Nautilus'' between 1866 and 1868. ''The Mysterious Island'' was written in 1874 but is set immediately after the [[American Civil War]], from 1861 to 1865. This would mean that Captain Nemo who appeared in ''The Mysterious Island'' dies ''before'' Captain Nemo who appeared in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' sets out on the undersea travels. Also, when Captain Nemo is finally seen in ''The Mysterious Island'', he mentions having met Aronnax 16 years previously.\n\nMany errors in the original French first printing (the 'grand in-8' published by [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]]) are likely the fault of the editors who, at that time, were unlikely to consult the authors of the books they edited before making a change.  According to the new, full translation put out by the [[Naval Institute Press]], nearly all errors can be attributed to the editors, with only a few being the fault of Jules Verne, who was otherwise meticulous.  The inconsistency of the dates between ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' is perhaps evidence in this argument, as it seems unlikely that Verne would make such an obvious gaffe.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' goes down in the [[Maelstrom]] on June 2, 1868, according to ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', but may have survived. (''The Mysterious Island'' gives this date as June 22, 1867.) Captain Nemo dies on the ''Nautilus'' under Lincoln Island in ''The Mysterious Island'' on October 15, 1868. Therefore, some chronological inconsistencies still exist: Cyrus and Gideon knew of Captain Nemo years before Aronnax published his story, Nemo being trapped under Lincoln Island all during the time in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn most subsequent media adaptations of ''20,000 Leagues'' and ''Mysterious Island'', Nemo is (in a deviation from Verne's novels) depicted as a European.
