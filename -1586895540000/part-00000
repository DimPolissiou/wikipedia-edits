In October he sojourned for six days and nights in the Bonaventure cemetery, sleeping upon graves overnight, this being the safest and cheapest accommodation that he could find while he waited for money to be expressed from home. He found the cemetery even then breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring and wrote a lengthy chapter upon it, \"Camping in the Tombs.\"\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Part of the grounds was cultivated and planted with live-oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), about a hundred years ago, by a wealthy gentleman who had his country residence here But much the greater part is undisturbed. Even those spots which are disordered by art, Nature is ever at work to reclaim, and to make them look as if the foot of man had never known them. Only a small plot of ground is occupied with graves and the old mansion is in ruins.\n\nThe most conspicuous glory of Bonaventure is its noble avenue of live-oaks. They are the most magnificent planted trees I have ever seen, about fifty feet high and perhaps three or four feet in diameter, with broad spreading leafy heads. The main branches reach out horizontally until they come together over the driveway, embowering it throughout its entire length, while each branch is adorned like a garden with ferns, flowers, grasses, and dwarf palmettos.\n\nBut of all the plants of these curious tree-gardens the most striking and characteristic is the so-called Long Moss ([[Spanish moss|''Tillandsia usneoides'']]). It drapes all the branches from top to bottom, hanging in long silvery-gray skeins, reaching a length of not less than eight or ten feet, and when slowly waving in the wind they produce a solemn funereal effect singularly impressive.\n\nThere are also thousands of smaller trees and clustered bushes, covered almost from sight in the glorious brightness of their own light. The place is half surrounded by the salt marshes and islands of the river, their reeds and sedges making a delightful fringe. Many bald eagles roost among the trees along the side of the marsh. Their screams are heard every morning, joined with the noise of crows and the songs of countless warblers, hidden deep in their dwellings of leafy bowers. Large flocks of butterflies, flies, all kinds of happy insects, seem to be in a perfect fever of joy and sportive gladness. The whole place seems like a center of life. The dead do not reign there alone.\n\nBonaventure to me is one of the most impressive assemblages of animal and plant creatures I ever met. I was fresh from the Western prairies, the garden-like openings of Wisconsin, the beech and maple and oak woods of Indiana and Kentucky, the dark mysterious Savannah cypress forests; but never since I was allowed to walk the woods have I found so impressive a company of trees as the [[Tillandsia|tillandsia-draped]] oaks of Bonaventure.\n\nI gazed awe-stricken as one new-arrived from another world. Bonaventure is called a graveyard, a town of the dead, but the few graves are powerless in such a depth of life.

In October he sojourned for six days and nights in the Bonaventure cemetery, sleeping upon graves overnight, this being the safest and cheapest accommodation that he could find while he waited for money to be expressed from home. He found the cemetery even then breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring and wrote a lengthy chapter upon it, \"Camping in the Tombs.\"\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Part of the grounds was cultivated and planted with live-oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), about a hundred years ago, by a wealthy gentleman who had his country residence here But much the greater part is undisturbed. Even those spots which are disordered by art, Nature is ever at work to reclaim, and to make them look as if the foot of man had never known them. Only a small plot of ground is occupied with graves and the old mansion is in ruins.\n\nThe most conspicuous glory of Bonaventure is its noble avenue of live-oaks. They are the most magnificent planted trees I have ever seen, about fifty feet high and perhaps three or four feet in diameter, with broad spreading leafy heads. The main branches reach out horizontally until they come together over the driveway, embowering it throughout its entire length, while each branch is adorned like a garden with ferns, flowers, grasses, and dwarf palmettos.\n\nBut of all the plants of these curious tree-gardens the most striking and characteristic is the so-called Long Moss ([[Spanish moss|''Tillandsia usneoides'']]). It drapes all the branches from top to bottom, hanging in long silvery-gray skeins, reaching a length of not less than eight or ten feet, and when slowly waving in the wind they produce a solemn funereal effect singularly impressive.\n\nThere are also thousands of smaller trees and clustered bushes, covered almost from sight in the glorious brightness of their own light. The place is half surrounded by the salt marshes and islands of the river, their reeds and sedges making a delightful fringe. Many bald eagles roost among the trees along the side of the marsh. Their screams are heard every morning, joined with the noise of crows and the songs of countless warblers, hidden deep in their dwellings of leafy bowers. Large flocks of butterflies, flies, all kinds of happy insects, seem to be in a perfect fever of joy and sportive gladness. The whole place seems like a center of life. The dead do not reign there alone.\n\nBonaventure to me is one of the most impressive assemblages of animal and plant creatures I ever met. I was fresh from the Western prairies, the garden-like openings of Wisconsin, the beech and maple and oak woods of Indiana and Kentucky, the dark mysterious Savannah cypress forests; but never since I was allowed to walk the woods have I found so impressive a company of trees as the [[Tillandsia|tillandsia-draped]] oaks of Bonaventure.\n\nI gazed awe-stricken as one new-arrived from another world. Bonaventure is called a graveyard, a town of the dead, but the few graves are powerless in such a depth of life.

When volcanoes erupt, they eject carbon dioxide (CO2), water, hydrogen, [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2), [[hydrogen chloride]], [[hydrogen fluoride]], and many other gases.(Meronen et al. 2012) CO2 and water are [[greenhouse gas]]es, comprising 0.0394 percent and 0.4 percent of the atmosphere, respectively.

Different methods have estimated the ejected sulphur mass during the eruption: the [[petrological]] method; an optical depth measurement based on [[anatomy|anatomical]] observations; and the [[Polar region|polar]] [[ice core]] sulfate concentration method, using cores from Greenland and [[Antarctica]]. The figures vary depending on the method, ranging from 10 to 120 million [[tonne]]s.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/>\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1815, a persistent \"dry fog\" was observed in the northeastern United States. The fog reddened and dimmed the sunlight, such that sunspots were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the \"fog\". It was identified as a stratospheric sulfate aerosol veil.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> In summer 1816, countries in the Northern Hemisphere suffered extreme weather conditions, dubbed the \"[[Year Without a Summer]]\". Average global temperatures decreased by about {{convert|0.4 to 0.7|C-change|1}},<ref name=\"Stothers1984\"/> enough to cause significant agricultural problems around the globe. On 4 June 1816, frosts were reported in the upper elevations of New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, and northern New York. On 6 June 1816, snow fell in [[Albany, New York]] and [[Dennysville, Maine]].<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> Such conditions occurred for at least three months and ruined most agricultural crops in North America. Canada experienced extreme cold during that summer. Snow {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep accumulated near [[Quebec City]] from 6 to 10 June 1816.\n\nThe second-coldest year in the Northern Hemisphere since around 1400 was 1816, and the 1810s are the coldest decade on record. That was the consequence of Tambora's 1815 eruption and possibly another VEI-6 [[1808 mystery eruption|eruption in late 1808]]. The surface temperature anomalies during the summer of 1816, 1817, and 1818 were {{convert|-0.51|C-change|2}}, {{convert|-0.44|C-change|2}}, and {{convert|-0.29|C-change|2}}, respectively.<ref name=\"Briffa1998\"/> Parts of Europe also experienced a stormier winter.{{fact|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis climate anomaly has been blamed for the severity of [[typhus]] epidemics in southeast Europe and along the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] between 1816 and 1819.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> The climate changes disrupted the Indian [[monsoon]]s, caused three failed harvests and famine, and contributed to the spread of a new strain of [[cholera]] that originated in [[Bengal]] in 1816.<ref>Peterson, Doug ''LAS News'' (Spring 2010) [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] p. 11.</ref> Many livestock died in New England during the winter of 1816\u20131817. Cool temperatures and heavy rains resulted in failed harvests in Britain and Ireland. Families in [[Wales]] travelled long distances as refugees, begging for food. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, oat, and potato harvests. The crisis was severe in Germany, where food prices rose sharply, and demonstrations in front of grain markets and bakeries, followed by riots, arson, and looting, took place in many European cities. It was the worst famine of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/>\n\n==Effects of volcanism==\n\nVolcanism affects the atmosphere in two distinct ways: short-term cooling caused by reflected [[insolation]] and long-term warming from increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Most of the water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> is collected in clouds within a few weeks to months because both are already present in large quantities, so the effects are limited (Bodenmann et al. 2011{{citation needed|reason=incomplete reference|date=November 2014}}). {{citation needed span|SO<sub>2</sub>, other [[aerosol]]s, and particulates cause global cooling, thereby reducing or nullifying the global warming effects of a volcano's greenhouse gas emissions. SO<sub>2</sub> can be found higher in the atmosphere and bonds efficiently there with water vapor to form [[sulfuric acid]], which blocks solar radiation exceptionally well. It usually takes months to years for it to acquire enough water vapor to fall back to Earth.|date=June 2018}} It has been suggested that a volcanic eruption in 1809 may also have contributed to a reduction in global temperatures.<ref name=\"Dai1991\"/>\n\n==Impact of the eruption==\n\nBy most calculations, the eruption of Tambora was at least a full [[order of magnitude]] (10 times) larger than that of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991. (Graft et al. 1993) An estimated {{convert|1220|m}} of the top of the mountain collapsed to form a caldera, reducing the height of the summit by a third. Around {{convert|100|km3}} of rock was blasted into the air.(Williams 2012). Toxic gases also were pumped into the atmosphere, including sulfur that caused lung infections. (Cole-Dai et al. 2009) [[Volcanic ash]] was over {{convert|100|cm}} deep within {{convert|75|km}} of the eruption, while areas within a {{convert|500|km}} radius saw a {{convert|5|cm}} ash fall, and ash could be found as far away as {{convert|1300|km}}.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> The ash burned and smothered crops, creating an immediate shortage of food in [[Indonesia]]. (Cole-Dai et al. 2009) The ejection of these gases, especially hydrogen chloride, caused the precipitation to be extremely acidic, killing much of the crops that survived or were rebudding during the spring. The food shortages were compounded by the [[Napoleonic wars]], floods, and cholera.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> Its energy release was equivalent to about 33 [[gigatons]] of TNT.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190429092957/https://www.wired.com/2015/04/tambora-1815-just-big-eruption/</ref>\n\nThe ash in the atmosphere for several months after the eruption reflected significant amounts of solar radiation, causing unseasonably cool summers that contributed to food shortages.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> China, Europe, and North America had well-documented below normal temperatures, which devastated their harvests. The monsoon season in China and India was altered, causing flooding in the [[Yangtze Valley]] and forcing thousands of Chinese to flee coastal areas. (Granados et al. 2012) The gases also reflected some of the already-decreased incoming solar radiation, causing a {{convert|0.4 to 0.7|C-change|1}} decrease in global temperatures throughout the decade. An [[Ice jam|ice dam]] formed in Switzerland during the summers of 1816 and 1817, earning 1816 the title \"Year without a Summer\".(Bodenmann et al. 2011) The winter months of 1816 were not much different from previous years, but the spring and summer maintained the cool-to-freezing temperatures. The winter of 1817, however, was radically different, with temperatures below {{convert|\u221230|F}} in central and northern New York, which were cold enough to freeze lakes and rivers that were normally used to transport supplies. Both Europe and North America suffered from freezes lasting well into June, with snow accumulating to {{convert|32|cm}} in August, which killed recently planted crops and crippled the food industry. The length of the growing seasons in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire were less than 80 days in 1816, resulting in harvest failures.(Oppenheimer 2003) Visually unique sunsets were observed in western Europe, and red fog was observed along the eastern coast of the U.S. These unique atmospheric conditions persisted for the better part of 2.5 years. (Robock 2000)\n\nScientists have used ice cores to monitor atmospheric gases during the cold decade (1810\u20131819), and the results have been puzzling. The [[sulfate]] concentrations found in both [[Siple Station]], Antarctica and central Greenland bounced from 5.0{{clarify|date=April 2013}} in January 1816 to 1.1{{clarify|date=April 2013}} in August 1818.<ref name=\"Dai1991\"/> This means that 25\u201330 teragrams of sulfur were ejected into the atmosphere, most of which came from Tambora, followed by a rapid decrease through natural processes. Tambora caused the largest shift in sulfur concentrations in ice cores for the past 5,000 years. Estimates of the sulfur yield vary from 10 teragrams (Black et al. 2012) to 120 teragrams (Stothers 2000), with the average of the estimates being 25\u201330 teragrams. The high concentrations of sulfur could have caused a four-year stratospheric warming of around {{convert|15|C-change|0}}, resulting in a delayed cooling of surface temperatures that lasted for nine years. (Cole-Dai et al. 2009) This has been dubbed a \"[[volcanic winter]]\", similar to a nuclear winter because of the overall decrease in temperatures and abysmal farming conditions.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/>\n\nClimate data have shown that the variance between daily lows and highs may have played a role in the lower average temperature because the fluctuations were much more subdued. Generally, the mornings were warmer because of nightly cloud cover and the evenings were cooler because the clouds had dissipated. There were documented fluctuations of cloud cover for various locations that suggested it was a nightly occurrence and the sun killed them off, much like a fog.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> The class boundaries between 1810\u20131830 without volcanically perturbed years was around {{convert|7.9|C-change|1}}. In contrast, the volcanically perturbed years (1815\u20131817) had a change of only around {{convert|2.3|C-change|1}}. This meant that the mean annual cycle in 1816 was more linear than bell shaped and 1817 endured cooling across the board. Southeastern England, northern France, and the Netherlands experienced the greatest amount of cooling in Europe, accompanied by New York, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Rhode Island in North America. (Bodenmann et al. 2011)\n\nThe documented rainfall was as much as 80 percent more than the calculated normal with regards to 1816, with unusually high amounts of snow in Switzerland, France, Germany, and Poland. This is again contrasted by the unusually low precipitations in 1818, which caused droughts throughout most of Europe and Asia. (Auchmann et al. 2012) Russia had already experienced unseasonably warm and dry summers since 1815 and this continued for the next three years. There are also documented reductions in ocean temperature near the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. This seems to have been an indicator of shifted oceanic circulation patterns and possibly changed wind direction and speed. (Meronen et al. 2012) This is further supported by the a British fleet sent to explore the Arctic Circle. They found large ice sheets miles off the coast of Greenland, where two years prior they had been limited to the near-shore waters of eastern Greenland. Contemporary scientists have attributed the \"Year Without a Summer\" to the drifting polar ice sheets rather than the eruption of Tambora because of their proximity to England. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\nTaking into account the Dalton Minimum and the presence of famine and droughts predating the eruption, the Tambora eruption accelerated or exacerbated the extreme climate conditions of 1815. While other eruptions and other climatological events would have led to a global cooling of about \n{{convert|0.2|C-change|1}}, Tambora increased on that benchmark substantially.<ref name=\"Dai1991\"/>\n\n==Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ <big>Table I.

On 6 June 1816, snow fell in [[Albany, New York]] and [[Dennysville, Maine]].<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> Such conditions occurred for at least three months and ruined most agricultural crops in North America. Canada experienced extreme cold during that summer. Snow {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep accumulated near [[Quebec City]] from 6 to 10 June 1816.\n\nThe second-coldest year in the Northern Hemisphere since around 1400 was 1816, and the 1810s are the coldest decade on record. That was the consequence of Tambora's 1815 eruption and possibly another VEI-6 [[1808 mystery eruption|eruption in late 1808]]. The surface temperature anomalies during the summer of 1816, 1817, and 1818 were {{convert|-0.51|C-change|2}}, {{convert|-0.44|C-change|2}}, and {{convert|-0.29|C-change|2}}, respectively.<ref name=\"Briffa1998\"/> Parts of Europe also experienced a stormier winter.{{fact|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis climate anomaly has been blamed for the severity of [[typhus]] epidemics in southeast Europe and along the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] between 1816 and 1819.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> The climate changes disrupted the Indian [[monsoon]]s, caused three failed harvests and famine, and contributed to the spread of a new strain of [[cholera]] that originated in [[Bengal]] in 1816.<ref>Peterson, Doug ''LAS News'' (Spring 2010) [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] p. 11.</ref> Many livestock died in New England during the winter of 1816\u20131817. Cool temperatures and heavy rains resulted in failed harvests in Britain and Ireland. Families in [[Wales]] travelled long distances as refugees, begging for food. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, oat, and potato harvests. The crisis was severe in Germany, where food prices rose sharply, and demonstrations in front of grain markets and bakeries, followed by riots, arson, and looting, took place in many European cities. It was the worst famine of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/>\n\n==Effects of volcanism==\n\nVolcanism affects the atmosphere in two distinct ways: short-term cooling caused by reflected [[insolation]] and long-term warming from increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Most of the water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> is collected in clouds within a few weeks to months because both are already present in large quantities, so the effects are limited (Bodenmann et al. 2011{{citation needed|reason=incomplete reference|date=November 2014}}). {{citation needed span|SO<sub>2</sub>, other [[aerosol]]s, and particulates cause global cooling, thereby reducing or nullifying the global warming effects of a volcano's greenhouse gas emissions. SO<sub>2</sub> can be found higher in the atmosphere and bonds efficiently there with water vapor to form [[sulfuric acid]], which blocks solar radiation exceptionally well. It usually takes months to years for it to acquire enough water vapor to fall back to Earth.|date=June 2018}} It has been suggested that a volcanic eruption in 1809 may also have contributed to a reduction in global temperatures.<ref name=\"Dai1991\"/>\n\n==Impact of the eruption==\n\nBy most calculations, the eruption of Tambora was at least a full [[order of magnitude]] (10 times) larger than that of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991. (Graft et al. 1993) An estimated {{convert|1220|m}} of the top of the mountain collapsed to form a caldera, reducing the height of the summit by a third. Around {{convert|100|km3}} of rock was blasted into the air.(Williams 2012). Toxic gases also were pumped into the atmosphere, including sulfur that caused lung infections. (Cole-Dai et al. 2009) [[Volcanic ash]] was over {{convert|100|cm}} deep within {{convert|75|km}} of the eruption, while areas within a {{convert|500|km}} radius saw a {{convert|5|cm}} ash fall, and ash could be found as far away as {{convert|1300|km}}.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> The ash burned and smothered crops, creating an immediate shortage of food in [[Indonesia]]. (Cole-Dai et al. 2009) The ejection of these gases, especially hydrogen chloride, caused the precipitation to be extremely acidic, killing much of the crops that survived or were rebudding during the spring. The food shortages were compounded by the [[Napoleonic wars]], floods, and cholera.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> Its energy release was equivalent to about 33 [[gigatons]] of TNT.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190429092957/https://www.wired.com/2015/04/tambora-1815-just-big-eruption/</ref>\n\nThe ash in the atmosphere for several months after the eruption reflected significant amounts of solar radiation, causing unseasonably cool summers that contributed to food shortages.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> China, Europe, and North America had well-documented below normal temperatures, which devastated their harvests. The monsoon season in China and India was altered, causing flooding in the [[Yangtze Valley]] and forcing thousands of Chinese to flee coastal areas. (Granados et al. 2012) The gases also reflected some of the already-decreased incoming solar radiation, causing a {{convert|0.4 to 0.7|C-change|1}} decrease in global temperatures throughout the decade. An [[Ice jam|ice dam]] formed in Switzerland during the summers of 1816 and 1817, earning 1816 the title \"Year without a Summer\".(Bodenmann et al. 2011) The winter months of 1816 were not much different from previous years, but the spring and summer maintained the cool-to-freezing temperatures. The winter of 1817, however, was radically different, with temperatures below {{convert|\u221230|F}} in central and northern New York, which were cold enough to freeze lakes and rivers that were normally used to transport supplies. Both Europe and North America suffered from freezes lasting well into June, with snow accumulating to {{convert|32|cm}} in August, which killed recently planted crops and crippled the food industry. The length of the growing seasons in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire were less than 80 days in 1816, resulting in harvest failures.(Oppenheimer 2003) Visually unique sunsets were observed in western Europe, and red fog was observed along the eastern coast of the U.S. These unique atmospheric conditions persisted for the better part of 2.5 years. (Robock 2000)\n\nScientists have used ice cores to monitor atmospheric gases during the cold decade (1810\u20131819), and the results have been puzzling. The [[sulfate]] concentrations found in both [[Siple Station]], Antarctica and central Greenland bounced from 5.0{{clarify|date=April 2013}} in January 1816 to 1.1{{clarify|date=April 2013}} in August 1818.<ref name=\"Dai1991\"/> This means that 25\u201330 teragrams of sulfur were ejected into the atmosphere, most of which came from Tambora, followed by a rapid decrease through natural processes. Tambora caused the largest shift in sulfur concentrations in ice cores for the past 5,000 years. Estimates of the sulfur yield vary from 10 teragrams (Black et al. 2012) to 120 teragrams (Stothers 2000), with the average of the estimates being 25\u201330 teragrams. The high concentrations of sulfur could have caused a four-year stratospheric warming of around {{convert|15|C-change|0}}, resulting in a delayed cooling of surface temperatures that lasted for nine years. (Cole-Dai et al. 2009) This has been dubbed a \"[[volcanic winter]]\", similar to a nuclear winter because of the overall decrease in temperatures and abysmal farming conditions.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/>\n\nClimate data have shown that the variance between daily lows and highs may have played a role in the lower average temperature because the fluctuations were much more subdued. Generally, the mornings were warmer because of nightly cloud cover and the evenings were cooler because the clouds had dissipated. There were documented fluctuations of cloud cover for various locations that suggested it was a nightly occurrence and the sun killed them off, much like a fog.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/> The class boundaries between 1810\u20131830 without volcanically perturbed years was around {{convert|7.9|C-change|1}}. In contrast, the volcanically perturbed years (1815\u20131817) had a change of only around {{convert|2.3|C-change|1}}. This meant that the mean annual cycle in 1816 was more linear than bell shaped and 1817 endured cooling across the board. Southeastern England, northern France, and the Netherlands experienced the greatest amount of cooling in Europe, accompanied by New York, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Rhode Island in North America. (Bodenmann et al. 2011)\n\nThe documented rainfall was as much as 80 percent more than the calculated normal with regards to 1816, with unusually high amounts of snow in Switzerland, France, Germany, and Poland. This is again contrasted by the unusually low precipitations in 1818, which caused droughts throughout most of Europe and Asia. (Auchmann et al. 2012) Russia had already experienced unseasonably warm and dry summers since 1815 and this continued for the next three years. There are also documented reductions in ocean temperature near the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. This seems to have been an indicator of shifted oceanic circulation patterns and possibly changed wind direction and speed. (Meronen et al. 2012) This is further supported by the a British fleet sent to explore the Arctic Circle. They found large ice sheets miles off the coast of Greenland, where two years prior they had been limited to the near-shore waters of eastern Greenland. Contemporary scientists have attributed the \"Year Without a Summer\" to the drifting polar ice sheets rather than the eruption of Tambora because of their proximity to England. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\nTaking into account the Dalton Minimum and the presence of famine and droughts predating the eruption, the Tambora eruption accelerated or exacerbated the extreme climate conditions of 1815. While other eruptions and other climatological events would have led to a global cooling of about \n{{convert|0.2|C-change|1}}, Tambora increased on that benchmark substantially.<ref name=\"Dai1991\"/>\n\n==Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ <big>Table I.

His childhood was affected by the German occupation of the Czechoslovakia during the World War II, when the whole Czech nation suffered greatly under the Nazi rule.\n \nThe beginnings of his interest in the spiritual life date back to as early as 1945. The very first spiritual book J. Vacek encountered, which influenced him greatly, was the Burning Bush (subtitled the ''[[Revealed Mystic Path]]'') by [[Karel Weinfurter]]. According to this book, J. Vacek started practising mystic exercises, namely the mantra repetition (IEOUA mantra) and silent concentration on the spiritual heart.\n\nFrom the very start, he also felt attracted to the personality of [[Ramana Maharshi]], a spiritual teacher and sage from the 19th to 20th century, whose [[atma-vichara]] (the path of [[Self-enquiry]]) J. Vacek practiced from the end of the 1950s. His other spiritual masters, who he was personally in touch with, were Jaroslav Ko\u010d\u00ed from Ostrava and later [[M\u00edla Tom\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1]].\n\nDuring the communist regime, Ji\u0159\u00ed Vacek was interrogated by the State Security (communist secret police) owing to his spiritual interests and even sentenced for \"disturbing the socialistic way of life\". Consequently, he was also sacked from work for a few times. Despite all that, he kept spreading both his original works and translations in the form of so-called [[samizdat]]s .\n\nAfter the fall of the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia in 1989, J. Vacek began to operate in public and published translations of many spiritual books, especially the works with the teachings of [[Ramana Maharshi]] and also the books dealing with the non-dualistic realization \u2013 [[Advaita]]. He even translated several works from Christianity and [[Zen Buddhism]]. Altogether, he has so far published over 100 of his own original works and more than 30 translations from the English language.\n\nBeing retired, J. Vacek dedicates his free time to public meditations and meditations with his friends/students.\n\n== Essence of teaching ==\n\n<blockquote>What is the Path?\nThe path lies in turning away from the changing forms to their unchanging nature, which is their source. It lies in the withdrawal of consciousness\u00b4 attention from observed objects and its turning to the observer or witness, the consciousness itself, which leads to the realization of our true Nature, the Self, as pure consciousness and destruction of the illusion that we are a being limited by mind and body \u2013 ego. This way, it leads to liberation from worldly suffering and the rebirth cycle, countless lives and deaths in it, and to the restoration of the natural and original unlimited bliss of pure being. It removes the illusion of diversity and leads to the realization of the Unity, which is the highest Truth, the Lord, the eternal life and true happiness.<ref>Vacek, Ji\u0159\u00ed. ''Jnana Gita''.

(Czech)</ref> Just as him, Ji\u0159\u00ed Vacek teaches that the basis of the spiritual life lies in finding our true existence in the self-aware consciousness or, in other words, in the realisation of our [[true Self]]. The easiest way how to realise our true Self is to follow the \"footprint\" of the [[Observation|observer]], since it is always true that to be able to observe anything, we \u2013 consciousness, that observes or is aware of observed objects, must be present here. In the consciousness of the observer, we continuously distinguish ourselves from all the observed/observable objects, which are: our body, the creations of our mind including our feelings, and the surrounding world. Simultaneously and directly, without words or thinking, we try to realise and experience that we are the non-material consciousness, which is aware of these observed objects. This is the most important element of the spiritual practice that we can and should practice permanently, even during all of our common daily activities. By the consciousness of the self-aware observer, we introduce the divine life into our day-to-day life. Then, we do not need to divide our life into the worldly activities and the spiritual ones, although formal meditation is still the basis.

(Czech)</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\nJi\u0159\u00ed Vacek was born in 1931 in Slan\u00fd (a town near Prague) on Whit Monday, a day belonging to Whitsuntide \u2013 a significant feast of the liturgical year (the feast of the Holy Spirit). His childhood was affected by the German occupation of the Czechoslovakia during the World War II, when the whole Czech nation suffered greatly under the Nazi rule.\n \nThe beginnings of his interest in the spiritual life date back to as early as 1945. The very first spiritual book J. Vacek encountered, which influenced him greatly, was the Burning Bush (subtitled the ''[[Revealed Mystic Path]]'') by [[Karel Weinfurter]]. According to this book, J. Vacek started practising mystic exercises, namely the mantra repetition (IEOUA mantra) and silent concentration on the spiritual heart.\n\nFrom the very start, he also felt attracted to the personality of [[Ramana Maharshi]], a spiritual teacher and sage from the 19th to 20th century, whose [[atma-vichara]] (the path of [[Self-enquiry]]) J. Vacek practiced from the end of the 1950s. His other spiritual masters, who he was personally in touch with, were Jaroslav Ko\u010d\u00ed from Ostrava and later [[M\u00edla Tom\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1]].\n\nDuring the communist regime, Ji\u0159\u00ed Vacek was interrogated by the State Security (communist secret police) owing to his spiritual interests and even sentenced for \"disturbing the socialistic way of life\". Consequently, he was also sacked from work for a few times. Despite all that, he kept spreading both his original works and translations in the form of so-called [[samizdat]]s .\n\nAfter the fall of the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia in 1989, J. Vacek began to operate in public and published translations of many spiritual books, especially the works with the teachings of [[Ramana Maharshi]] and also the books dealing with the non-dualistic realization \u2013 [[Advaita]]. He even translated several works from Christianity and [[Zen Buddhism]]. Altogether, he has so far published over 100 of his own original works and more than 30 translations from the English language.\n\nBeing retired, J. Vacek dedicates his free time to public meditations and meditations with his friends/students.\n\n== Essence of teaching ==\n\n<blockquote>What is the Path?\nThe path lies in turning away from the changing forms to their unchanging nature, which is their source. It lies in the withdrawal of consciousness\u00b4 attention from observed objects and its turning to the observer or witness, the consciousness itself, which leads to the realization of our true Nature, the Self, as pure consciousness and destruction of the illusion that we are a being limited by mind and body \u2013 ego. This way, it leads to liberation from worldly suffering and the rebirth cycle, countless lives and deaths in it, and to the restoration of the natural and original unlimited bliss of pure being. It removes the illusion of diversity and leads to the realization of the Unity, which is the highest Truth, the Lord, the eternal life and true happiness.<ref>Vacek, Ji\u0159\u00ed. ''Jnana Gita''.

(Czech)</ref> Just as him, Ji\u0159\u00ed Vacek teaches that the basis of the spiritual life lies in finding our true existence in the self-aware consciousness or, in other words, in the realisation of our [[true Self]]. The easiest way how to realise our true Self is to follow the \"footprint\" of the [[Observation|observer]], since it is always true that to be able to observe anything, we \u2013 consciousness, that observes or is aware of observed objects, must be present here. In the consciousness of the observer, we continuously distinguish ourselves from all the observed/observable objects, which are: our body, the creations of our mind including our feelings, and the surrounding world. Simultaneously and directly, without words or thinking, we try to realise and experience that we are the non-material consciousness, which is aware of these observed objects. This is the most important element of the spiritual practice that we can and should practice permanently, even during all of our common daily activities. By the consciousness of the self-aware observer, we introduce the divine life into our day-to-day life. Then, we do not need to divide our life into the worldly activities and the spiritual ones, although formal meditation is still the basis. We simply try to carry out with all of our activities while being consciously aware of our true Self, our divine nature. This gradually makes all our activities easier since the level of our awareness rises and we can concentrate better and better on condition that we do not forget about our Self \u2013 us being different from anything that can be observed. This practice also enables us to work on the second crucial element of the spiritual practice, which is the dissolution of vasanas, tendencies of our mind directed towards our body and our world separated/fallen off from God.<ref>Vacek, Ji\u0159\u00ed (2015).

While she may not have been able to demonstrate power and steel like her colleague [[Birgit Nilsson]] on these recordings, her great emotional expression and her good vocal technique are shown to full advantage.

She continued to sing regularly at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] where she sang the Marschallin in 1979 and created the role of Goneril in the premiere of [[Aribert Reimann]]'s [[Lear (opera)|''Lear'']] in 1978, a role she also sang in several other German houses and, in an English translation, at [[San Francisco Opera]] in 1981. In October 2000, she created the title role in another Reimann opera, ''Bernarda Albas Haus'' in Munich.\n\nShe made her [[Metropolitan Opera]] debut in 1985 as Marfa in ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' and subsequently sang Prince Orlofsky in ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' (1986),  Herodias in ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', Fricka in ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'', Waltraute in ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'', and the Nurse ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (all during the 1989-1990 season). She returned to Met in 1994 for performances as Madame de Croissy in ''[[Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]'' and Adelaide in ''[[Arabella]]'', and  in 1995 as Leocadia Begbick in ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]''.<ref>[http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm Met Opera Archives].

{"title_page": "Abelian group", "text_new": "{{short description|Commutative group (mathematics)}}\n{{For|the group described by the archaic use of the related term \"Abelian linear group\"|Symplectic group}}\n\n{{Group theory sidebar|Basics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''abelian group''', also called a '''commutative group''', is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the result of applying the group [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written. That is, the group operation is [[commutative]]. With the addition as an operation, the [[integer]]s and the [[real number]]s form abelian groups, and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples. Abelian groups are named after early 19th century mathematician [[Niels Henrik Abel]].<ref>Jacobson 2009, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate courses of [[abstract algebra]], and underlies many fundamental [[algebraic structure]]s, such as [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood and [[#Classification|fully classified]].\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Group}}\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Group-like structures}}\nAn abelian group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], <math>A</math>, together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] <math>\\cdot</math> that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> of <math>A</math> to form another element of <math>A,</math> denoted <math>a \\cdot b</math>. The symbol <math>\\cdot</math> is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, <math>(A, \\cdot)</math>, must satisfy five requirements known as the ''abelian group axioms'':\n\n;Closure: For all <math>a</math>, <math>b</math> in <math>A</math>, the result of the operation <math>a \\cdot b</math> is also in <math>A</math>.\n;Associativity: For all <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> in <math>A</math>, the equation <math>(a \\cdot b)\\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)</math> holds.\n;Identity element: There exists an element <math>e</math> in <math>A</math>, such that for all elements <math>a</math> in <math>A</math>, the equation <math>e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a</math> holds.\n;Inverse element: For each <math>a</math> in <math>A</math> there exists an element <math>b</math> in <math>A</math> such that <math>a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e</math>, where <math>e</math> is the identity element.\n;Commutativity: For all <math>a</math>, <math>b</math> in <math>A</math>, <math>a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a</math>.\n\nA group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a \"non-abelian group\" or \"non-commutative group\".\n\n== Facts ==\n\n=== Notation ===\n{{see also|Additive group|Multiplicative group}}\nThere are two main notational conventions for abelian groups \u2013 additive and multiplicative.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! Convention\n! Operation\n! Identity\n! Powers\n! Inverse\n|-\n! Addition\n| <math>x + y</math> || 0 || <math>nx</math> || <math>-x</math>\n|-\n! Multiplication\n| <math>x \\cdot y</math> or <math>xy</math> || 1\n| <math>x^n</math>\n| <math>x^{-1}</math>\n|}\n\nGenerally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being [[near-ring]]s and [[partially ordered group]]s, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.\n\n=== Multiplication table ===\nTo verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) \u2013 known as a [[Cayley table]] \u2013 can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is <math>G = \\{g_1 = e, g_2, \\dots, g_n \\}</math> under the operation <math>\\cdot</math>, the <math>(i, j)</math>-th entry of this table contains the product <math>g_i \\cdot g_j</math>. The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\nThis is true since if the group is abelian, then <math>g_i \\cdot g_j = g_j \\cdot g_i</math>. This implies that the <math>(i,j)</math> entry of the table equals the <math>(j,i)</math> entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\n== Examples ==\n* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] <math>+</math>, denoted <math>(\\mathbb{Z}, +)</math>, the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer <math>n</math> has an [[additive inverse]], <math>-n</math>, and the addition operation is commutative since <math>n + m = m + n</math> for any two integers <math>m</math> and <math>n</math>.\n* Every [[cyclic group]] <math>G</math> is abelian, because if <math>x</math>, <math>y</math> are in <math>G</math>, then <math>xy = a^ma^n = a^{m+n} = a^na^m = yx</math>. Thus the [[integer]]s, <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>, form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo <math>n</math>]], <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n \\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n* Every [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.\n* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian. The finite [[simple group|simple]] abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of [[Prime number|prime]] [[Order (group theory)|order]].<ref>Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA32 p. 32].</ref>\n* The concepts of abelian group and <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] agree.  More specifically, every <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-module is an abelian group with its operation of addition, and every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> in a unique way.\n\nIn general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication \u2013 one example is the group of <math>2 \\times 2</math> [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].\n\n== Historical remarks ==\n<!-- This particular statement seems to be suspect, but the direction is right. Note: updated and corrected on Sept. 2, 2012 -->\n[[Camille Jordan]] named abelian groups after [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]], because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a [[polynomial]] implies that the roots of the polynomial can be [[solvability by radicals|calculated by using radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.\n\n== Properties ==\nIf <math>n</math> is a [[natural number]] and <math>x</math> is an element of an abelian group <math>G</math> written additively, then <math>nx</math> can be defined as <math>x + x + \\cdots + x</math> (<math>n</math> summands) and <math>(-n)x = -(nx)</math>. In this way, <math>G</math> becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers. In fact, the modules over <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> can be identified with the abelian groups.\n\nTheorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}</math> for <math>p</math> prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\nIf <math>f, g: G \\to H</math> are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum <math>f + g</math>, defined by <math>(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math>, is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if <math>H</math> is a non-abelian group.) The set <math>\\text{Hom}(G,H)</math> of all group homomorphisms from <math>G</math> to <math>H</math> thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.\n\nSomewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the maximal [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of a set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.\n\nThe [[center (group theory)|center]] <math>Z(G)</math> of a group <math>G</math> is the set of elements that commute with every element of <math>G</math>. A group <math>G</math> is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center <math>Z(G)</math>. The center of a group <math>G</math> is always a [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] abelian subgroup of <math>G</math>. If the quotient group <math>G/Z(G)</math> of a group by its center is cyclic then <math>G</math> is abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA48 p. 48].</ref>\n\n== Finite abelian groups ==\nCyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo <math>n</math>]], <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}</math>, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].\n\nAny group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is also abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA79 p. 79].</ref> In fact, for every prime number <math>p</math> there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order <math>p^2</math>, namely <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}</math> and <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p\\times\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group <math>G</math> can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order; it is also known as the '''basis theorem for finite abelian groups'''.<ref>[[:de:Hans Kurzweil|Kurzweil, H.]], & [[:de:Bernd Stellmacher|Stellmacher, B.]], ''The Theory of Finite Groups: An Introduction'' (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iebSBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PR1&pg=PA43 pp. 43\u201354].</ref> This is generalized by the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]], with finite groups being the special case when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.\n\nThe classification was proven by [[Leopold Kronecker]] in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1801; see [[Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups#History|history]] for details.\n\nThe cyclic group <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{mn}</math> of order <math>mn</math> is isomorphic to the direct sum of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_m</math> and <math>\\mathbb{Z}_n</math> if and only if <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group <math>G</math> is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{u}\\ \\mathbb{Z}_{k_i}</math>\n\nin either of the following canonical ways:\n* the numbers <math>k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_u</math> are powers of (not necessarily distinct) primes,\n* or <math>k_1</math> [[divisor|divides]] <math>k_2</math>, which divides <math>k_3</math>, and so on up to <math>k_u</math>.\n\nFor example, <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{15}</math> can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\cong  \\{0,5,10\\} \\oplus \\{0,3,6,9,12\\}</math>. The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].\n\nFor another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either <math>\\mathbb{Z}_8</math> (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), <math>\\mathbb{Z}_4\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2</math> (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2</math>.\n\nSee also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.\n\n=== Automorphisms ===\nOne can apply the [[#Classification|fundamental theorem]] to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group <math>G</math>. To do this, one uses the fact that if <math>G</math> splits as a direct sum <math>H\\oplus K</math> of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then <math>\\text{Aut}(H\\oplus K) \\cong \\text{Aut}(H)\\oplus \\text{Aut}(K)</math>.\n\nGiven this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of <math>G</math> it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] <math>p</math>-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of <math>p</math>). Fix a prime <math>p</math> and suppose the exponents <math>e_i</math> of the cyclic factors of the Sylow <math>p</math>-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:\n\n:<math>e_1\\leq e_2 \\leq\\cdots\\leq e_n</math>\n\nfor some <math>n > 0</math>. One needs to find the automorphisms of\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.</math>\n\nOne special case is when <math>n = 1</math>, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow <math>p</math>-subgroup <math>P</math>. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when <math>n</math> is arbitrary but <math>e_i = 1</math> for <math> 1 \\le i  \\le n</math>. Here, one is considering <math>P</math> to be of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_p \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_p,</math>\n\nso elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension <math>n</math> over the finite field of <math>p</math> elements <math>\\mathbb{F}_p</math>. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\cong\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbf{F}_p),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\text{GL}</math> is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order\n\n:<math> \\left|\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\right|=(p^n-1)\\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).</math>\n\nIn the most general case, where the <math>e_i</math> and <math>n</math> are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines\n\n:<math>d_k=\\max\\{r\\mid e_r = e_k^{\\,}\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>c_k=\\min\\{r\\mid e_r=e_k\\}</math>\n\nthen one has in particular <math>k \\le d_k</math>, <math>c_k \\le k</math>, and\n\n:<math> \\left|\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\right| = \\prod_{k=1}^n (p^{d_k}-p^{k-1}) \\prod_{j=1}^n (p^{e_j})^{n-d_j} \\prod_{i=1}^n (p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}. </math>\n\nOne can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., & Rhea, D.).\n\n==Finitely generated abelian groups==\n{{main|Finitely generated abelian group}}\nAn abelian group {{mvar|A}} is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called ''generators'') <math>G=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}</math> such that every element of the group is a [[linear combination]] with integer coefficients of elements of {{mvar|G}}. \n\nLet {{mvar|L}} be a [[free abelian group]] with basis <math>B=\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}.</math> \nThere is a unique [[group homomorphism]]\n<math>p\\colon L \\to A,</math> such that \n:<math>p(b_i) = x_i\\quad \\text{for } i=1,\\ldots, n.</math>\nThis homomorphism is surjective, and its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] is finitely generated (since integers form a [[Noetherian ring]]). Consider the matrix {{mvar|M}} with integer entries, such that the entries of its {{mvar|j}}th column are the coefficients of the {{mvar|j}}th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the [[cokernel]] of linear map defined by {{mvar|M}}. Conversely every [[integer matrix]] defines a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nIt follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of {{mvar|A}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the left by a [[unimodular matrix]] (that is, an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of {{mvar|M}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the right by an unimodular matrix.\n\nThe [[Smith normal form]] of {{mvar|M}} is a matrix\n:<math>S=UMV,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}} are unimodular, and {{mvar|S}} is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries {{tmath|d_{1,1}, \\ldots, d_{k,k} }} are the first ones, and {{tmath|d_{j,j} }} is a divisor of {{tmath|d_{i,i} }} for {{math|''i'' > ''j''}}. The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group {{mvar|A}} is the [[direct sum]] \n:<math>\\Z^r \\oplus \\Z/d_{1,1}\\Z \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\Z/d_{k,k}\\Z,</math> \nwhere {{mvar|r}} is the number of zero rows at the bottom of {{mvar|r}} (and also the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the group). This is the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]].\n\nThe existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.\n\n== Infinite abelian groups ==\nThe simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] <math>A</math> is isomorphic to the direct sum of <math>r</math> copies of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of [[prime power]] orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number <math>r</math>, called the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of <math>A</math>, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.\n\nBy contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups <math>A</math> in which the equation <math>nx = a</math> admits a solution <math>x \\in A</math> for any natural number <math>n</math> and element <math>a</math> of <math>A</math>, constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> and [[Pr\u00fcfer group]]s <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p/Z_p</math> for various prime numbers <math>p</math>, and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.<ref>For example, <math>\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\sum_p \\mathbb{Q}_p/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.</ref> Moreover, if a divisible group <math>A</math> is a subgroup of an abelian group <math>G</math> then <math>A</math> admits a direct complement: a subgroup <math>C</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>G = A \\oplus C</math>. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''.\n\nTwo important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', exemplified by the groups <math>\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}</math> (periodic) and <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> (torsion-free).\n\n=== Torsion groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''', if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Pr\u00fcfer theorems]] state that if <math>A</math> is a periodic group, and it either has a '''bounded exponent''', i.e., <math>nA = 0</math> for some natural number <math>n</math>, or is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|<math>p</math>-heights]] of the elements of <math>A</math> are finite for each <math>p</math>, then <math>A</math> is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.<ref>Countability assumption in the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^m\\mathbb{Z}</math> for all natural <math>m</math> is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.</ref> \nThe cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^m\\mathbb{Z}</math> in such a decomposition is an invariant of <math>A</math>. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem to countable abelian <math>p</math>-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.\n\n=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of [[torsion-free abelian group]]s have been studied extensively:\n\n* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|<math>p</math>-adic integers]]\n* [[Slender group]]s\n\nAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If <math>A</math> is an abelian group and <math>T(A)</math> is its [[torsion subgroup]], then the factor group  <math>A/T(A)</math> is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of <math>A</math>, so  <math>A</math> is ''not'' isomorphic to <math>T(A) \\oplus A/T(A)</math>. Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups. The additive group <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers is torsion-free <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-module.<ref>Lal, R., ''Algebra 2: Linear Algebra, Galois Theory, Representation Theory, Group Extensions and Schur Multiplier'' (Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer, 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwPNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA206 p. 206].</ref>{{rp|206}}\n\n=== Invariants and classification ===\nOne of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group <math>A</math> is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of <math>A</math>. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank <math>r</math> is a subgroup of <math>\\mathbb{Q}_r</math>. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|<math>p</math>-adic integers]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math> is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-rank and the groups <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p^n</math> with different <math>n</math> are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.\n\nThe classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fuchs]], [[Phillip Griffith]], and [[David Arnold (mathematician)|David Arnold]], as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in ''[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]]'' for more recent findings.\n\n=== Additive groups of rings ===\nThe additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:\n\n* [[Tensor product]]\n* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups\n* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions.\n\n== Relation to other mathematical topics ==\nMany large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.\n\nThe collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[Group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] <math>\\textbf{Ab}</math>, the prototype of an [[abelian category]].\n\nNearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student {{harvs|first=Wanda|last=Szmielew|authorlink=Wanda Szmielew|year=1955|txt}} proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:\n*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;\n*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;\n*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.\n*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.\n*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in [[computational group theory]].\n\nMoreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:\n* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]] ([[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]]), the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present-day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;\n* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;\n* Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).\n\n== A note on the typography ==\nAmong mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase '''a''', rather than an uppercase '''A''', indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701231658/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html |archive-date=1 July 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=3 July 2016|title=Abel Prize Awarded: The Mathematicians' Nobel}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*{{annotated link|Commutator subgroup}}\n*{{annotated link|Abelianization}}\n*{{annotated link|Dihedral group of order 6}}, the smallest non-abelian group\n*{{annotated link|Elementary abelian group}}\n*{{annotated link|Pontryagin duality}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=David |author-link=David A.

That is, the group operation is [[commutative]]. With the addition as an operation, the [[integer]]s and the [[real number]]s form abelian groups, and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples. Abelian groups are named after early 19th century mathematician [[Niels Henrik Abel]].<ref>Jacobson 2009, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate courses of [[abstract algebra]], and underlies many fundamental [[algebraic structure]]s, such as [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood and [[#Classification|fully classified]].\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Group}}\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Group-like structures}}\nAn abelian group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], <math>A</math>, together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] <math>\\cdot</math> that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> of <math>A</math> to form another element of <math>A,</math> denoted <math>a \\cdot b</math>. The symbol <math>\\cdot</math> is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, <math>(A, \\cdot)</math>, must satisfy five requirements known as the ''abelian group axioms'':\n\n;Closure: For all <math>a</math>, <math>b</math> in <math>A</math>, the result of the operation <math>a \\cdot b</math> is also in <math>A</math>.\n;Associativity: For all <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> in <math>A</math>, the equation <math>(a \\cdot b)\\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)</math> holds.\n;Identity element: There exists an element <math>e</math> in <math>A</math>, such that for all elements <math>a</math> in <math>A</math>, the equation <math>e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a</math> holds.\n;Inverse element: For each <math>a</math> in <math>A</math> there exists an element <math>b</math> in <math>A</math> such that <math>a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e</math>, where <math>e</math> is the identity element.\n;Commutativity: For all <math>a</math>, <math>b</math> in <math>A</math>, <math>a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a</math>.\n\nA group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a \"non-abelian group\" or \"non-commutative group\".\n\n== Facts ==\n\n=== Notation ===\n{{see also|Additive group|Multiplicative group}}\nThere are two main notational conventions for abelian groups \u2013 additive and multiplicative.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! Convention\n! Operation\n! Identity\n! Powers\n! Inverse\n|-\n! Addition\n| <math>x + y</math> || 0 || <math>nx</math> || <math>-x</math>\n|-\n! Multiplication\n| <math>x \\cdot y</math> or <math>xy</math> || 1\n| <math>x^n</math>\n| <math>x^{-1}</math>\n|}\n\nGenerally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being [[near-ring]]s and [[partially ordered group]]s, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.\n\n=== Multiplication table ===\nTo verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) \u2013 known as a [[Cayley table]] \u2013 can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is <math>G = \\{g_1 = e, g_2, \\dots, g_n \\}</math> under the operation <math>\\cdot</math>, the <math>(i, j)</math>-th entry of this table contains the product <math>g_i \\cdot g_j</math>. The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\nThis is true since if the group is abelian, then <math>g_i \\cdot g_j = g_j \\cdot g_i</math>. This implies that the <math>(i,j)</math> entry of the table equals the <math>(j,i)</math> entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\n\n== Examples ==\n* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] <math>+</math>, denoted <math>(\\mathbb{Z}, +)</math>, the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer <math>n</math> has an [[additive inverse]], <math>-n</math>, and the addition operation is commutative since <math>n + m = m + n</math> for any two integers <math>m</math> and <math>n</math>.\n* Every [[cyclic group]] <math>G</math> is abelian, because if <math>x</math>, <math>y</math> are in <math>G</math>, then <math>xy = a^ma^n = a^{m+n} = a^na^m = yx</math>. Thus the [[integer]]s, <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>, form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo <math>n</math>]], <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n \\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n* Every [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.\n* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian. The finite [[simple group|simple]] abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order.<ref>Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA32 p. 32].</ref>\n* The concepts of abelian group and <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] agree.  More specifically, every <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-module is an abelian group with its operation of addition, and every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> in a unique way.\n\nIn general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication \u2013 one example is the group of <math>2 \\times 2</math> [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].\n\n== Historical remarks ==\n<!-- This particular statement seems to be suspect, but the direction is right. Note: updated and corrected on Sept. 2, 2012 -->\n[[Camille Jordan]] named abelian groups after [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]], because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a [[polynomial]] implies that the roots of the polynomial can be [[solvability by radicals|calculated by using radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.\n\n== Properties ==\nIf <math>n</math> is a [[natural number]] and <math>x</math> is an element of an abelian group <math>G</math> written additively, then <math>nx</math> can be defined as <math>x + x + \\cdots + x</math> (<math>n</math> summands) and <math>(-n)x = -(nx)</math>. In this way, <math>G</math> becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers. In fact, the modules over <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> can be identified with the abelian groups.\n\nTheorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}</math> for <math>p</math> prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.\n\nIf <math>f, g: G \\to H</math> are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum <math>f + g</math>, defined by <math>(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math>, is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if <math>H</math> is a non-abelian group.) The set <math>\\text{Hom}(G,H)</math> of all group homomorphisms from <math>G</math> to <math>H</math> thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.\n\nSomewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the maximal [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of a set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.\n\nThe [[center (group theory)|center]] <math>Z(G)</math> of a group <math>G</math> is the set of elements that commute with every element of <math>G</math>. A group <math>G</math> is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center <math>Z(G)</math>. The center of a group <math>G</math> is always a [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] abelian subgroup of <math>G</math>. If the quotient group <math>G/Z(G)</math> of a group by its center is cyclic then <math>G</math> is abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA48 p. 48].</ref>\n\n== Finite abelian groups ==\nCyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo <math>n</math>]], <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}</math>, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].\n\nAny group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is also abelian.<ref>Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA79 p. 79].</ref> In fact, for every prime number <math>p</math> there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order <math>p^2</math>, namely <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}</math> and <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p\\times\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n\n=== Classification ===\nThe '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group <math>G</math> can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order; it is also known as the '''basis theorem for finite abelian groups'''.<ref>[[:de:Hans Kurzweil|Kurzweil, H.]], & [[:de:Bernd Stellmacher|Stellmacher, B.]], ''The Theory of Finite Groups: An Introduction'' (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iebSBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PR1&pg=PA43 pp. 43\u201354].</ref> This is generalized by the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]], with finite groups being the special case when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.\n\nThe classification was proven by [[Leopold Kronecker]] in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1801; see [[Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups#History|history]] for details.\n\nThe cyclic group <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{mn}</math> of order <math>mn</math> is isomorphic to the direct sum of <math>\\mathbb{Z}_m</math> and <math>\\mathbb{Z}_n</math> if and only if <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group <math>G</math> is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{u}\\ \\mathbf{Z}_{k_i}</math>\n\nin either of the following canonical ways:\n* the numbers <math>k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_u</math> are powers of (not necessarily distinct) primes,\n* or <math>k_1</math> [[divisor|divides]] <math>k_2</math>, which divides <math>k_3</math>, and so on up to <math>k_u</math>.\n\nFor example, <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{15}</math> can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{15} \\cong  \\{0,5,10\\} \\oplus \\{0,3,6,9,12\\}</math>. The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].\n\nFor another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either <math>\\mathbb{Z}_8</math> (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), <math>\\mathbb{Z}_4\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2</math> (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2</math>.\n\nSee also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.\n\n=== Automorphisms ===\nOne can apply the [[#Classification|fundamental theorem]] to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group <math>G</math>. To do this, one uses the fact that if <math>G</math> splits as a direct sum <math>H\\oplus K</math> of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then <math>\\text{Aut}(H\\oplus K) \\cong \\text{Aut}(H)\\oplus \\text{Aut}(K)</math>.\n\nGiven this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of <math>G</math> it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] <math>p</math>-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of <math>p</math>). Fix a prime <math>p</math> and suppose the exponents <math>e_i</math> of the cyclic factors of the Sylow <math>p</math>-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:\n\n:<math>e_1\\leq e_2 \\leq\\cdots\\leq e_n</math>\n\nfor some <math>n > 0</math>. One needs to find the automorphisms of\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.</math>\n\nOne special case is when <math>n = 1</math>, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow <math>p</math>-subgroup <math>P</math>. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when <math>n</math> is arbitrary but <math>e_i = 1</math> for <math> 1 \\le i  \\le n</math>. Here, one is considering <math>P</math> to be of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Z}_p \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}_p,</math>\n\nso elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension <math>n</math> over the finite field of <math>p</math> elements <math>\\mathbb{F}_p</math>. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\cong\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbf{F}_p),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\text{GL}</math> is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order\n\n:<math> \\left|\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\right|=(p^n-1)\\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).</math>\n\nIn the most general case, where the <math>e_i</math> and <math>n</math> are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines\n\n:<math>d_k=\\max\\{r\\mid e_r = e_k^{\\,}\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>c_k=\\min\\{r\\mid e_r=e_k\\}</math>\n\nthen one has in particular <math>k \\le d_k</math>, <math>c_k \\le k</math>, and\n\n:<math> \\left|\\operatorname{Aut}(P)\\right| = \\prod_{k=1}^n (p^{d_k}-p^{k-1}) \\prod_{j=1}^n (p^{e_j})^{n-d_j} \\prod_{i=1}^n (p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}. </math>\n\nOne can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., & Rhea, D.).\n\n==Finitely generated abelian groups==\n{{main|Finitely generated abelian group}}\nAn abelian group {{mvar|A}} is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called ''generators'') <math>G=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}</math> such that every element of the group is a [[linear combination]] with integer coefficients of elements of {{mvar|G}}. \n\nLet {{mvar|L}} be a [[free abelian group]] with basis <math>B=\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}.</math> \nThere is a unique [[group homomorphism]]\n<math>p\\colon L \\to A,</math> such that \n:<math>p(b_i) = x_i\\quad \\text{for } i=1,\\ldots, n.</math>\nThis homomorphism is surjective, and its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] is finitely generated (since integers form a [[Noetherian ring]]). Consider the matrix {{mvar|M}} with integer entries, such that the entries of its {{mvar|j}}th column are the coefficients of the {{mvar|j}}th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the [[cokernel]] of linear map defined by {{mvar|M}}. Conversely every [[integer matrix]] defines a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nIt follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of {{mvar|A}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the left by a [[unimodular matrix]] (that is, an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of {{mvar|M}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the right by an unimodular matrix.\n\nThe [[Smith normal form]] of {{mvar|M}} is a matrix\n:<math>S=UMV,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}} are unimodular, and {{mvar|S}} is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries {{tmath|d_{1,1}, \\ldots, d_{k,k} }} are the first ones, and {{tmath|d_{j,j} }} is a divisor of {{tmath|d_{i,i} }} for {{math|''i'' > ''j''}}. The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group {{mvar|A}} is the [[direct sum]] \n:<math>\\Z^r \\oplus \\Z/d_{1,1}\\Z \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\Z/d_{k,k}\\Z,</math> \nwhere {{mvar|r}} is the number of zero rows at the bottom of {{mvar|r}} (and also the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the group). This is the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]].\n\nThe existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.\n\n== Infinite abelian groups ==\nThe simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] <math>A</math> is isomorphic to the direct sum of <math>r</math> copies of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of [[prime power]] orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number <math>r</math>, called the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of <math>A</math>, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.\n\nBy contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups <math>A</math> in which the equation <math>nx = a</math> admits a solution <math>x \\in A</math> for any natural number <math>n</math> and element <math>a</math> of <math>A</math>, constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> and [[Pr\u00fcfer group]]s <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p/Z_p</math> for various prime numbers <math>p</math>, and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.<ref>For example, <math>\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\sum_p \\mathbb{Q}_p/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.</ref> Moreover, if a divisible group <math>A</math> is a subgroup of an abelian group <math>G</math> then <math>A</math> admits a direct complement: a subgroup <math>C</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>G = A \\oplus C</math>. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''.\n\nTwo important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', exemplified by the groups <math>\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}</math> (periodic) and <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> (torsion-free).\n\n=== Torsion groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''', if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Pr\u00fcfer theorems]] state that if <math>A</math> is a periodic group, and it either has a '''bounded exponent''', i.e., <math>nA = 0</math> for some natural number <math>n</math>, or is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|<math>p</math>-heights]] of the elements of <math>A</math> are finite for each <math>p</math>, then <math>A</math> is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.<ref>Countability assumption in the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^m\\mathbb{Z}</math> for all natural <math>m</math> is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.</ref> \nThe cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}/p^m\\mathbb{Z}</math> in such a decomposition is an invariant of <math>A</math>. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem to countable abelian <math>p</math>-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.\n\n=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===\n\nAn abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of [[torsion-free abelian group]]s have been studied extensively:\n\n* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|<math>p</math>-adic integers]]\n* [[Slender group]]s\n\nAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If <math>A</math> is an abelian group and <math>T(A)</math> is its [[torsion subgroup]], then the factor group  <math>A/T(A)</math> is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of <math>A</math>, so  <math>A</math> is ''not'' isomorphic to <math>T(A) \\oplus A/T(A)</math>. Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups. The additive group <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers is torsion-free <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-module.<ref>Lal, R., ''Algebra 2: Linear Algebra, Galois Theory, Representation Theory, Group Extensions and Schur Multiplier'' (Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer, 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwPNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA206 p. 206].</ref>{{rp|206}}\n\n=== Invariants and classification ===\nOne of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group <math>A</math> is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of <math>A</math>. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank <math>r</math> is a subgroup of <math>\\mathbb{Q}_r</math>. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|<math>p</math>-adic integers]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math> is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-rank and the groups <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p^n</math> with different <math>n</math> are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.\n\nThe classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fuchs]], [[Phillip Griffith]], and [[David Arnold (mathematician)|David Arnold]], as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in ''[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]]'' for more recent findings.\n\n=== Additive groups of rings ===\nThe additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:\n\n* [[Tensor product]]\n* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups\n* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions.\n\n== Relation to other mathematical topics ==\nMany large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.\n\nThe collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[Group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] <math>\\textbf{Ab}</math>, the prototype of an [[abelian category]].\n\nNearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student {{harvs|first=Wanda|last=Szmielew|authorlink=Wanda Szmielew|year=1955|txt}} proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:\n*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;\n*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;\n*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.\n*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.\n*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in [[computational group theory]].\n\nMoreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:\n* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]] ([[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]]), the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present-day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;\n* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;\n* Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).\n\n== A note on the typography ==\nAmong mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase '''a''', rather than an uppercase '''A''', indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701231658/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html |archive-date=1 July 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=3 July 2016|title=Abel Prize Awarded: The Mathematicians' Nobel}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*{{annotated link|Commutator subgroup}}\n*{{annotated link|Abelianization}}\n*{{annotated link|Dihedral group of order 6}}, the smallest non-abelian group\n*{{annotated link|Elementary abelian group}}\n*{{annotated link|Pontryagin duality}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=David |author-link=David A.

The team consisted of two brothers Husnlal (1910\u201328 December 1968) and Bhagatram (1916\u2013 29 November 1973) who was elder of two. They were most popular music composers in the 1940s and early 1950s.<ref name=\"Gulaz\u0101raNihalani2003\">{{cite book|author1=Gulzar|last2=Nihalani|first2=Govind|last3=Chatterjee|first3=Saibal|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC&pg=PT584|year=2003|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7991-066-5|pages=584\u2013}}</ref> It is said that the concept of a duo of music directors began with them. Their eldest brother Amarnath was also a famous music composer of H M V and film music in 1940s. The brothers trained famous music directors Shankar (of [[Shankar Jaikishan]]), Laxmikant (of Laxmikant -Pyarelal) [[Khayyam]] and the singer, [[Mahendra Kapoor]].<ref name=\"Gulaz\u0101raNihalani2003\"/> and many more\n\n==Background==\nThe duo were born in Village Kahma, [[Jalandhar district]], Punjab.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Career==\nHusan Lal & Bhagatram became the first music director who worked as a pair. They got their first break in the film 'Chand' in 1944. They gave their first hit with 'Do dilon ko yeh duniya milne bhi nahin deti..' sung by Manju.\n\nHusan Lal was an accomplished violinist and a renowned classical vocalist and Bhagatram was an ace [[Pump organ|harmonium]] player. They were the brothers of the famous composer of the 1940s, [[Pandit Amarnath]], and both worked as his assistants.\n\nIn 1944, the duo got their first break in the film Chand. The song, 'Do Dilon Ko Yeh Duniya' sung by Manju, was their very first hit. Husan lal - Bhagatram popularised Punjabi folk music, and featured its lilt and rhythm in their music compositions. In the late 1940s, they became the most celebrated composers with the success of films like Pyar Ki Jeet and Badi Bahen. Towards their elder brother Amarnath's last days, the duo helped Amarnath complete the score for the film Mirza Sahiban.\n\nTheir song, 'Ek Dil Ke Tukde Hazaar Huye' (Pyar Ki Jeet) sung by Mohammed Rafi brought in a new era of sad songs. They took a lot of pains to make sure this song was an instant hit. They also composed the famous song \"Suno Suno Ai Duniya Walo, Bapu Ki Yeh Amar Kahani\", sung by Mohd Rafi which was a milestone in the history of Bollywood Industry.\n\nThey worked with highly acclaimed lyricists like Shewan Rizvi, Aarzu Lucknavi, Brajendra Gaud, Kaif Irfani, Sarshar Sailani, Nakshab Jarachavi, Qamar Jalalabadi, [[Asad Bhopali]], [[Rajendra Krishan]] and Mulk Raj Bhakri.
