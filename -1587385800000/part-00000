Population estimates approximate 170,000 birds, making it the most common of the Hawaiian thrushes.

The back and primaries are a dull olive brown.  They also have whitish vents and undertail coverts.   The juveniles are also similarly dull in coloration, but have pale whitish-buff spotting on the wing coverts.\n\n==Behaviour==\n\u2018\u014cma\u2019os are mostly [[frugivores]], but will take insects or other small invertebrates.\nThe bird has a song that is a set of jerky liquid notes, ''whip-per-weeo-whip-per-weet''. Their many calls include a cat-like rasp, a frog like croak and even a high pitched police whistle type sound. During breeding, the birds make a bulky nest in a tree or [[tree fern]], laying one to three bluish eggs inside.\n\n==Habitat==\nThe \u2018\u014dma\u2019o once lived on most of the land of Hawaii. Today it is restricted to the southern and eastern slopes of the island, mostly above 1,000 meters above sea level, 25 to 30 percent of its ancestral habitat. Its preferred habitat is [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests|rainforest]], but can be found in [[Hawaiian tropical high shrublands|high shrublands]] on [[Mauna Loa]]. Preferred trees include the [[ohia]] and [[koa]].  The Hawaiian thrush avoids areas with [[banana poka]] (an invasive vine). In lower elevations, it appears to be gaining a natural resistance to [[avian malaria]].  Threats to this species include [[habitat destruction]] from housing, tourism development and farming; introduced feral animal predation (mainly rats, cats and mongoose); [[invasive plant]] encroachment; and feral livestock such as goats and pigs.\n\nThe species has been aided by several conservation actions.

He has an affectionate sister  Sudha ([[Geetanjali (actress)|Geethanjali]]). Chakravarthy is extremely fond of his sister. Sudha is a great musician and loves writing poetry and she marries a loving person. However, by the time Chakravarthy returns to his hometown, his sister is terribly ill and in the last stages of her life. Chakravarthy gets distraught to know that his sister has cancer. Sudha requests Chakravarthy to marry her sister-in-law Nirmala ([[Sowcar Janaki]]) as a dying wish. Chakravarthy doesn't get a chance to tell that he has already loved a woman in life. He suppresses the sadness and marries Nirmala as per his sister's wish. Nirmala is a materialistic person who loves going around for picnics, shopping and doesn't understand the artistic subtleties in life. Chakravarthy is a busy doctor with nonstop work dealing with patients, treatment and tests. He has nothing in common with Nirmala and their life goes on in a mechanical way, despite staying under one roof. The story makes a turn when Chakravarthy meets Ravindra ([[Jaggayya (actor)|Jaggayya]]) and his wife Madhavi ([[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]]). Madhavi is a great veena player and writes poetry exactly like Chakravarthy's lost sister Sudha. Chakravathy starts feeling that his sister has returned in the form of Madhavi. He feels relief in visiting their house and speaking to Madhavi so that it's like speaking to his own sister. Though Madhavi finds Chakravarthy's behavior a little odd in the beginning, her husband convinces her, saying Chakravarthy is a very good gentleman.\n\nMeanwhile, Nirmala despises the affection of Chakravarthy towards Madhavi's family. On the ill advice of the cook ([[Suryakantham]]), Nirmala writes a secret letter to Ravindra by wrongly quoting the friendship of Chakravarthy and Madhavi. Ravindra starts believing the cooked up story and hates Chakravarthy. He insults Madhavi without even considering that the latter is pregnant and in a weakened condition. As the story reaches its climax, Ravindra realizes that Chakravarthy only had brotherly affection, but nothing else on Madhavi. Nirmala realizes her mistake of writing such a letter. Ravindra realizes his blunder and even names his newborn son after Chakravarthy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]] as Dr. Chakravarthy\n*[[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]] as Madhavi\n*[[Jaggayya (actor)|Jaggayya]] as Ravindra\n*[[Krishna Kumari (actress)|Krishna Kumari]] as Dr. Sridevi\n*[[Sowcar Janaki]] as Nirmala\n*[[Gummadi Venkateswara Rao|Gummadi]] as Inspector Sridhar\n*[[Padmanabham]] as Venkata Swamy\n*[[Chalam]] as Venkata Ramana\n*[[Suryakantham]] as Kanthamma\n*[[Geetanjali (actress)|Geethanjali]] as Sudha\n*[[Jayanthi (actress)|Jayanthi]] as Padma\n\n==Crew==\n*'''Art''': G.

The Governor-General of British India, [[Lord Canning]] ruled in his arbitration that the empire was to be divided into two separate sultanates: [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|The Sultanate of Zanzibar]] with its dependencies to [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]], Said's former Governor of the East African dominions, and [[Muscat and Oman|the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman]] to [[Thuwaini bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Thuwaini bin Said]]. On 10 March 1862, the Zanzibar Guarantee Treaty was signed in [[Paris]] by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], whereby both parties agreed to respect the independence of the Sultan of Oman and the Sultan of Zanzibar. Recognizing the economic loss caused to Oman by the severance of the Zanzibar connection, Thuwaini insisted Majid pay 40,000 [[Maria Theresa thaler]]s annually as compensation but the payment fell into arrears and ceased a year later.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKAtjJoXXpwC&pg=PA224 |title=The Rough Guide to Oman|last=|first=|publisher=Gavin Thomas|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=226}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n{{portal|Oman}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|url=http://www.san.beck.org/1-13-Africa1500-1800.html |accessdate=2013-11-11\n |last=Beck |first=Sanderson|year=2004|chapter=East Africa, Portuguese, and Arabs|title=Middle East & Africa to 1875}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Davies|first=Charles E.|title=The Blood-red Arab Flag: An Investigation Into Qasimi Piracy, 1797-1820\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGboFK2QPUwC&pg=PA52|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=978-0-85989-509-5}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Limbert|first=Mandana|title=In the Time of Oil: Piety, Memory, and Social Life in an Omani Town\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zs3FT5SZ_2cC&pg=PT153|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |date=2010-06-07|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7460-4}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Thomas|first=Gavin|title=The Rough Guide to Oman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKAtjJoXXpwC&pg=PA222|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |date=2011-11-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4053-8935-8}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Siebert|first=Stefan|title=Analysis of Arid Agricultural Systems Using Quantitative Image Analysis, Modeling and Geographical Information Systems\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTjTRBsw_BgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |year=2005|publisher=kassel university press GmbH|isbn=978-3-89958-192-8}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Ochs|first=Peter J.|title=Maverick Guide to Oman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTP47KlX4hUC&pg=PA258|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |date=1999-11-01|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-4556-0865-2}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Plekhanov|first=Sergey|title=A Reformer on the Throne: Sultan Qaboos Bin Said Al Said\n |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-U8BL-tEPLwC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_-U8BL-tEPLwC/page/n51 49]\n |accessdate=2013-11-11\n |year=2004|publisher=Trident Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-900724-70-8}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |last=Miles|first=Samuel Barrett|authorlink=Samuel Barrett Miles|title=The Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbsOoPpZiSEC&pg=PA225|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |year=1919|publisher=Garnet & Ithaca Press|isbn=978-1-873938-56-0}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv\n |author=JPM Guides|title=Gulf States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8nMCRYnKn8C&pg=PA85|accessdate=2013-11-11\n |date=2000-03-01|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-2-88452-099-7}}\n\n[[Category:Former sultanates]]\n[[Category:Former countries in the Middle East]]\n\n{{improve categories|date=December 2018}}\n", "name_user": "Sinaloa", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omani_Empire"}

However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. Gandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from Lok Sabha. She said: \"There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments\". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her.\n\nAfter news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty.

Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.
