{"title_page": "British Poetry Revival", "text_new": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005). Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.\n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting.

Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.

The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Iain Sinclair]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], Dick Russell and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in 'CLASP: late modernist poetry in London' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism.\n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996).

The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, \"If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful.\" He also expressed his concern for defencemen, \"It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen ... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time ... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt.\" At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen [[Paul Martin (ice hockey)|Paul Martin]], [[Johnny Oduya]] and [[Bryce Salvador]] were all out with injuries.<ref name=\"Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid\">{{cite web|last=Gulitti|first=Tom|url=http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid/|title=Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid|publisher=Fire&Ice|accessdate=November 10, 2009|date=November 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113050802/http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid|archivedate=November 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUltimately the suggestion was rejected and the rule stayed in place. Former Maple Leafs' general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] said, \"We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn't handle the puck behind the net at all.

Some of the things Brodeur talks about in the book are player salaries and contracts, NHL marketing, [[Lou Lamoriello]], and the Devils' new arena in Newark, the [[Prudential Center]]. Brodeur also includes his views on the \"new NHL\" after the lockout, and how it affected his career.<ref name=\"biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470838515/|title=Brodeur: Beyond the Crease (Hardcover)|accessdate=December 6, 2006|publisher=Amazon.com|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nBrodeur co-owns a business called La Pizzeria Etc. with former teammate [[Sheldon Souray]].

The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, \"If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful.\" He also expressed his concern for defencemen, \"It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen ... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time ...

Former Maple Leafs' general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] said, \"We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn't handle the puck behind the net at all.
