Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]]\u2019s [[7th U.S. Cavalry]] attacked [[Black Kettle]]\u2019s Southern [[Cheyenne]] camp on the [[Washita River]] (the present-day [[Washita Battlefield National Historic Site]] near [[Cheyenne, Oklahoma]]).\n\nThey were the most isolated band of a major winter encampment along the river of numerous Native American tribal bands, totaling thousands of people. But Custer's forces attacked their village because scouts had followed the trail of a party that had raided white settlers and passed through it. Black Kettle and his people had been at peace and were seeking peace. Custer's soldiers killed women and children in addition to warriors, although they also took many captive to serve as hostages and human shields. The number of Cheyenne killed in the attack has been disputed since the first reports.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the Southern Cheyenne and [[Arapaho]] signed the [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]], they were \u2014 according to the final treaty text as affirmed by Congress \u2014 required to move south from present-day [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]] to a new reservation in [[Indian Territory]] (modern Oklahoma). The actual oral accord of the treaty negotiations, however, had guaranteed the Cheyennes their traditional hunting lands as long as there was sufficient buffalo to justify the chase, a crucial treaty stipulation which was tacitly dropped in the subsequent ratification process. This forced them to give up their traditional territory for one with little arable land and away from [[American Bison|buffalo]], their main source of meat and a center of their culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0984.htm|title=INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES.

Among these raids were those along the [[Solomon River (Kansas)|Solomon]] and [[Saline River (Kansas)|Saline]] rivers in Kansas, which began August 10, 1868. The warriors killed at least 15 white settlers, wounded others, and were reported to have raped some women, as well as taking others captive to be adopted into their tribes.\n\nIn 1897, Kansas Rep. Horace L. Moore remarked at a meeting of the Kansas State Historical Society that \"The total of losses from September 12, 1868, to February 9, 1869, exclusive of casualties incident to military operations, was 158 men murdered, sixteen wounded and forty-one scalped. Three scouts were killed, fourteen women outraged, one man was captured, four women and twenty-four children were carried off. Nearly all of these losses occurred in what we then called western Kansas, although the Saline, Solomon and Republican do not seem so very far west now\".<ref name=\"moore\">Moore, January 19, 1897, p. 350.</ref>\n\nOn August 19, 1868, Colonel [[Edward W.

Wynkoop and Little Rock|interviewed Little Rock]], a chief in [[Black Kettle]]'s Cheyenne village. [[Little Rock (Cheyenne chief)|Little Rock]] told what he had learned about the raids along the Saline and Solomon rivers. According to Little Rock's account, a war party of about 200 Cheyenne from a camp above the forks of Walnut Creek departed camp intending to go out against the Pawnee. Instead, they raided white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers. Some of the warriors returned to Black Kettle's camp. Little Rock learned from them what took place. Little Rock identified the warriors most responsible for the raids and agreed to try to have them delivered to white authorities.<ref name=\"wynkoop-littlerock\">[[s:Interview between E. W.

In April 1868, the U.S. Army distributed food provisions due the Cheyenne and Arapaho at Fort Larned and Fort Dodge, both north of the Arkansas. On August 9, 1868, they had distributed treaty annuities in the form of arms and ammunition at Fort Larned rather than south of the Arkansas.<ref name=\"hardorff-56n\">Hardorff 2006, p. 56 note 2.</ref>\n\nBlack Kettle continued, asking if he might move his people south to Fort Cobb:\n\n<blockquote>The Cheyennes do not fight at all this side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the fighting began I have not been able to keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the [[Antelope Hills (Oklahoma)|Antelope Hills]], and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyenne north of the Arkansas.<ref name=\"hazen-record\"/></blockquote>\n\nBig Mouth of the Arapaho spoke next, saying in part:\n\n<blockquote>I never would have gone north of the Arkansas again, but my father there [the agent] sent for me time after time, saying it was the place for my people, and finally I went. No sooner had we got there than there was trouble. I do not want war, and my people do not, but although we have come back south of the Arkansas, the soldiers follow us and continue fighting, and we want you to send out and stop these soldiers from coming against us.<ref name=\"hazen-record\"/></blockquote>\n\nHazen's October 13 orders from General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], commander of the Military Division of the Missouri, had charged Hazen with making provision for Indians who wanted to stay out of the war. The orders stated if General [[Philip Sheridan]] had to invade the reservation to pursue hostile Indians, he needed to spare the \"well-disposed\".  Sherman recommended that non-belligerent Indians camp near Fort Cobb.

When he went back to retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north who looked like soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. Bad Man doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said perhaps he had a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs' wishes by joining the war party.

Custer's troops followed this trail all day without a break until nightfall, when they rested briefly until there was sufficient moonlight to continue. They followed the trail to Black Kettle's village, where Custer divided his force into four parts, moving each into position so that at first daylight they could simultaneously converge on the village.<ref name=\"hoig-124\">Hoig 1980, p. 124.</ref> At daybreak, as the columns attacked, Double Wolf awoke and fired his gun to alert the village; he was among the first to die in the charge.<ref name=\"greene-129\">Greene 2004, p. 129.</ref> The Cheyenne warriors hurriedly left their lodges to take cover behind trees and in deep ravines.

The Osage scouts led Custer toward the village, hearing sounds and smelling smoke from the camp long before the soldiers. The Osage did not participate in the initial attack, fearing that the soldiers would mistake them for Cheyenne and shoot them. Instead, they waited behind the color-bearer of the 7th US Cavalry on the north side of the river until the village was taken. The Osage rode into the village, where they took scalps and helped the soldiers round up fleeing Cheyenne women and children.<ref>[https://waba.oncell.com/en/8-osage-and-sharpshooters-69599.html at 0:42.

As the fighting began to subside, he saw large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops and learned that Black Kettle's village was only one of many Indian encampments along the river, where thousands of Indians had gathered. Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others seized the Indians' property and horses. They destroyed what they did not want or could not carry, including about 675 ponies and horses.

Sheridan on November 28, 1868, Custer reported that by \"actual and careful examination after the battle,\" the bodies of 103 warriors were found<ref name=\"custer-1868-11-28\"/><ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> \u2014 a figure echoed by Sheridan when from Camp Supply he relayed news of the Washita fight to Bvt. Maj. Gen. W.A. Nichols the following day.<ref name=\"sheridan-1868-11-29\"/> In fact, no battlefield count of the dead was made.<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/><ref name=\"hoig-200\"/> According to Lt. [[Edward Settle Godfrey|Edward S. Godfrey]], no estimate of Indian warrior fatalities was made until the evening of the day following the battle, after the soldiers made camp during their march back to Camp Supply.<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> \"On [the] second night [after the battle],\" Godfrey told interviewer Walter M. Camp in 1917, \"Custer interrogated the officers as to what Indians they had seen dead in the village, and it was from these reports that the official report of Indians killed was made up. The dead Indians on the field were not counted by the troops then, but guessed at later, as explained.\"<ref name=\"godfrey-1917\">Camp, Walter M. (March 3, 1917). Interview of Lt. Edward S. Godfrey. In Hardorff 2006, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nIn his 1928 memoir, Godfrey related, \"After supper in the evening, the officers were called together and each one questioned as to the casualties of enemy warriors, locations, etc. Every effort was made to avoid duplications. The total was found to be one hundred and three.\"<ref name=\"godfrey-1928-29\">Godfrey, Edward S.

Holloway's ''Wild Life on the Plains and Horrors of Indian Warfare'', that \"Custer assembled the officers to inquire of each how many dead Indians ''each'' had seen; then what each had seen were added. ''They had all seen the same dead Indians''.\" [emphasis in original].<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/>\n\nJohn Poisal and Jack Fitzpatrick, [[mixed-blood]] scouts attached to the Seventh Cavalry,<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> reported a different number of Indian casualties to scout J.S. Morrison when they arrived at [[Fort Dodge, Kansas|Fort Dodge]] with the Cheyenne prisoners.<ref name=\"hardorff-282\">Hardorff 2006, p. 282.</ref> In a letter to Indian Agent Col. [[Edward W. Wynkoop]] on December 14, 1868, Morrison wrote,\n\n<blockquote>John Smith, John Poysell [Poisal], and Jack Fitzpatrick have got in today. John S. was not in the [Washita] fight, but John P. and Jack were. They all agree in stating that the official reports of the fight were very much exaggerated; that there were not over twenty bucks killed; the rest, about 40, were women and children.<ref name=\"morrison-letter\"/></blockquote>The Cheyenne prisoners, interviewed by Gen. Sheridan at Camp Supply, reported 13 Cheyenne men, two Sioux, and one Arapaho killed at the Washita,<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> a figure which Sheridan subsequently reported to Bvt. Maj. Gen. Nichols.<ref name=\"sheridan-1868-12-03\"/> The journalist DeB. Randolph Keim interviewed the women prisoners with the help of interpreter Richard Curtis. He obtained the names of those killed and arrived at the same figure of 13 Cheyenne, two Sioux, and one Arapaho killed.<ref name=\"keim-1868-12-24\"/> Later information from various Cheyenne sources, most of them independent of each other, tended to confirm the figures given by the Cheyenne women prisoners.<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> Few of the military reports noted casualties among the women and children. Custer acknowledged in his report, \"In the excitement of the fight, as well as in self-defence, it so happened that some of the squaws and a few of the children were killed and wounded....\"<ref name=\"custer-1868-11-28\"/>\n\nAfter Custer and Sheridan visited the battlefield in December, Custer revised his initial estimate of 103 warriors killed upward. He wrote from Fort Cobb,\n<blockquote>The Indians admit a loss of 140 killed, besides a heavy loss of wounded. This, with the Indian prisoners we have in our possession, makes the entire loss of the Indian in killed, wounded, and missing not far from 300.<ref name=\"custer-1868-12-22\"/></blockquote>\n\nHoig points out that if true, the number would mean that virtually everyone in Black Kettle's village was killed or captured.<ref name=\"hoig-200\"/> Greene states, \"Custer's figures were inflated, and the specific sources of his information remain unknown.\"<ref name=\"greene-136\"/>\n\nHardorff notes questions about this total.\n<blockquote>This new number was based on information obtained from two imprisoned Kiowa chiefs at Fort Cobb who faced death by hanging. In view of their predicament, it seems likely that these men would have said anything to avoid the gallows. But such skepticism is not warranted in the case of the Washita prisoners. The Cheyenne women were allowed to mingle freely with the officers and knew many of them on an intimate basis. They were assured good treatment and had no apparent reason to distort their statements about dead kinsmen.<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/></blockquote>\n\nGreene finds the Cheyenne and other Indian estimates most reliable. He writes, \"As might be expected, the best estimates must come from the people who suffered the losses,\" though noting, \"even these do not agree.\"<ref name=\"greene-136\"/> Utley, however, writes, \"Indian calculations \u2014 a dozen warriors and twice as many women and children killed \u2013 are as improbably low as Custer's are high.\"<ref name=\"utley-70\">Utley 2001, p. 70.</ref> Hoig writes, \"Even though the number 103 was not arrived at by a precise battlefield count, it is a definite figure which has already been placed on historical markers of the battlefield. Since it will likely never be proved absolutely incorrect, the figure will undoubtedly remain accepted as the number of Indians killed by Custer at the Washita. History should make it clear, however, that the dead were by no means all warriors who were met in open battle and defeated.\"<ref name=\"hoig-201\">Hoig 1980, p. 201.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the Cheyenne accounts provide names of men killed at the Washita.<ref name=\"keim-1868-12-24\"/><ref name=\"bent-1913-08-28\"/><ref name=\"grinnell-1916-10-03\"/><ref name=\"bent-1916-12-04\"/><ref name=\"hyde\">Hyde 1968, p. 322.</ref> In his book on the Washita, Greene provides an appendix of \"Known Village Fatalities at the Washita.\"  He compiled a list of all unique names, for a total of 40 men, 12 women (of whom 11 are unidentified), and six unidentified children. Greene notes that some individuals might have more than one name, so some entries might be duplicates.<ref name=\"greene-212-214\">Greene 2004, pp. 212\u2013214.</ref> Using the same sources, Richard G. Hardorff has compiled a \"Composite List of Names.\" It partially reconciles multiple names (or multiple translations of the same name) among the different sources; for example, the Mexican ''Pilan'', with Indian names White Bear and Tall White Man; or Bitter Man/Cranky Man, also known as Bad Man. Writes Hardorff, \"Some of the dead may have been identified by their birth name by one informant and by their nickname by another. Variations in the translation of personal names add to the confusion in the identification....\"<ref name=\"hardorff-402\">Hardorff 2006, p. 402.</ref>\n\n{| style=\"border:10px solid white\" align=\"\"\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:120%\" | '''Estimates of Indian casualties in the Battle of the Washita<br>according to contemporary sources'''\n|-\n! width=\"150\"|Source\n! width=\"80\"|Date of estimate\n! width=\"80\"|Men\n! width=\"78\"|Women\n! width=\"50\"|Children\n! width=\"50\"|Total\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background:#E0FFFF\"\n| Lt.

Davis]]\n\nFollowing the event, a controversy arose as to whether the event was best described as a military victory or as a massacre. This discussion endures among historians to this day.<ref name=Hardorff-29/>\n\nThe [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Bureau]] described the event as a \"massacre of innocent Indians\", and humanitarian groups denounced it as \"cold-blooded butchery\".<ref name=Hardorff-29/> The Cheyenne survivors considered it a horrifying event that gravely impacted their lives and community; the loss of many tribal elders, in particular, was profoundly damaging to Cheyenne families and society. Modern Cheyenne consider the event a massacre and are campaigning to change the name of the historical site to reflect that view.<ref>Hardorff 2006 p.31</ref>\n\nCuster himself did not consider Washita a massacre, stating that he did not kill every Indian in the village, though he said his forces could not avoid killing a few women in the middle of the hard fight. He said that some women took up weapons and were subsequently killed and that he took women and children prisoners.<ref name=\"greene-189\">Greene 2004, page 189.</ref> In his book about the encounter, published in 2004 for the National Park Service, historian Jerome Greene concluded that \"Soldiers evidently took measures to protect the women and children.\"<ref name=\"greene-189\"/>\n\nBy early December 1868, the attack had provoked debate and criticism in the press. In the December 9 ''Leavenworth Evening Bulletin'', an article noted: \"Gen. S. Sandford and Tappan, and Col. Taylor of the Indian Peace Commission, unite in the opinion that the late battle with the Indians was simply an attack upon peaceful bands, which were on the march to their new reservations\". The December 14 ''[[New York Tribune]]'' reported, \"Col. Wynkoop, agent for the Cheyenne and Arapahos Indians, has published his letter of resignation. He regards Gen. Custer's late fight as simply a massacre, and says that Black Kettle and his band, friendly Indians, were, when attacked, on their way to their reservation.\" The scout James S. Morrison wrote Indian Agent Col. Wynkoop that twice as many women and children as warriors had been killed during the attack.\n\nIn Custer's direct frontal assault on an armed and ostensibly hostile encampment, the only fatality in the 7th Cavalry in the fighting in the village itself was squadron commander Captain [[Louis McLane Hamilton]], a grandson of American [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]] [[Alexander Hamilton]].<ref name=\"hatch-81\"/><ref name=okla>{{cite journal |title=In Memory of Captain Louis McLane Hamilton |work=Chronicles of Oklahoma |volume=37 |year=1959 |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |pages=355\u2013359 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v037/v037p354.pdf }}</ref> The rest of the dead were with the detached command of Maj. Joel Elliott, who (as noted above) were killed more than a mile from the fighting in the village.<ref name=\"hatch-81\">Hatch 2002, page 81</ref> Companies A and D, composed of 120 officers and men, suffered only four wounded in the assault, and attacking Companies C and K, also totaling 120 officers and men, suffered no casualties.<ref name=\"hatch-81\"/>\n\nHistorian [[Paul Andrew Hutton]] wrote, \"Although the fight on the Washita was most assuredly one-sided, it was not a massacre. Black Kettle's Cheyennes were not unarmed innocents living under the impression that they were not at war. Several of Black Kettle's warriors had recently fought the soldiers, and the chief had been informed by Hazen that there could be no peace until he surrendered to Sheridan. The soldiers were not under orders to kill everyone, for Custer personally stopped the slaying of noncombatants, and fifty-three prisoners were taken by the troops.\"<ref>''The Custer Reader'', Norman: [[University of Oklahoma Press]], p. 102</ref>\n\nHistorian Joseph B. Thoburn considers the destruction of Black Kettle's village too one-sided to be called a battle. He reasons that had a superior force of Indians attacked a white settlement containing no more people than were in Black Kettle's camp, with like results, the incident would doubtless have been heralded as \"a massacre\".<ref name=\"Hardorff-29\">Hardorff 2006, p. 29.</ref> Historian Stan Hoig argues that the conflict fit the definition of a massacre because a group of people, even one in possession of weapons as the Cheyenne were, were killed \"indiscriminately, mercilessly and in large numbers\".<ref name=Hardorff30>Hardorff 2006, p. 30.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nDuring the late 20th century, a time of activism for Native American and minority [[civil rights]], and protests about the [[Vietnam War]], film and other media reflected changes in historians' perspective on the Battle of Washita River. They also used the event to reflect on contemporary issues. In the 1970 film ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'',<ref name=\"LBMfilm\">''Little Big Man'' (film). Directed by Arthur Penn. Based on novel by Thomas Berger. Written by Calder Willingham. Produced by Stuart Millar. Performers Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Chief Dan George, Martin Balsam, Richard Mulligan. Cinema Center Films, 1970.</ref> based on the 1964 novel by [[Thomas Berger (novelist)|Thomas Berger]], director [[Arthur Penn]] depicted the Seventh Cavalry's attack on Black Kettle's village on the Washita as a massacre resembling the 1968 [[My Lai massacre]] by U.S. troops in Vietnam.<ref name=\"fuller\">Fuller, Graham.

(2003-5-02). \"A shift to the rights: Sympathetic depiction of Indians in 'Little Big Man' is no small thing\", ''The Sacramento Bee''.</ref>\n\nThe 1991 television film ''[[Son of the Morning Star]]'', based on [[Evan S. Connell]]'s non-fiction book of the same name, presented the battle from the points of view of Kate Bighead (Cheyenne) and [[Elizabeth Bacon Custer|Elizabeth Custer]]. It depicted Chief Black Kettle as being killed by Custer's troopers, and Custer's not waiting for word of Major Elliott. The fourth episode of the 2005 TV miniseries ''[[Into the West (TV miniseries)|Into the West]]''  depicts Custer attacking and Black Kettle fleeing the village.\n\nThe television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' aired a special double-episode entitled \"Washita\" on April 29, 1995.<ref name=\"drquinn\">\"Washita.\" ''Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman'' (television series). CBS Broadcasting, Inc. Original broadcast April 29, 1995.</ref> The episode set the scene of the Washita attack in Colorado instead of Oklahoma, the site of the battle. It fictionalized Custer as deliberately misleading Colorado settlers about the difference between Black Kettle and his band, depicted as peaceful, and the Dog Soldiers, who were attacking farms and railroad crews. Lead character Dr. Michaela \"Mike\" Quinn made futile attempts to argue with Custer and to warn Black Kettle of impending massacre.\n\nIn the 2003 film ''[[The Last Samurai]]'',<ref name=\"lastsamurai\">''The Last Samurai'' (film).

Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]]\u2019s [[7th U.S. Cavalry]] attacked [[Black Kettle]]\u2019s Southern [[Cheyenne]] camp on the [[Washita River]] (the present-day [[Washita Battlefield National Historic Site]] near [[Cheyenne, Oklahoma]]). \n\nThey were the most isolated band of a major winter encampment along the river of numerous Native American tribal bands, totaling thousands of people. But Custer's forces attacked their village because scouts had followed the trail of a party that had raided white settlers and passed through it. Black Kettle and his people had been at peace and were seeking peace. Custer's soldiers killed women and children in addition to warriors, although they also took many captive to serve as hostages and human shields. The number of Cheyenne killed in the attack has been disputed since the first reports. \n\n==Background==\nAfter the Southern Cheyenne and [[Arapaho]] signed the [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]], they were \u2014 according to the final treaty text as affirmed by Congress \u2014 required to move south from present-day [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]] to a new reservation in [[Indian Territory]] (modern Oklahoma). The actual oral accord of the treaty negotiations, however, had guaranteed the Cheyennes their traditional hunting lands as long as there was sufficient buffalo to justify the chase, a crucial treaty stipulation which was tacitly dropped in the subsequent ratification process. This forced them to give up their traditional territory for one with little arable land and away from [[American Bison|buffalo]], their main source of meat and a center of their culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0984.htm|title=INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES.

Among these raids were those along the [[Solomon River (Kansas)|Solomon]] and [[Saline River (Kansas)|Saline]] rivers in Kansas, which began August 10, 1868. The warriors killed at least 15 white settlers, wounded others, and were reported to have raped some women, as well as taking others captive to be adopted into their tribes.\n\nIn 1897, Kansas Rep. Horace L. Moore remarked at a meeting of the Kansas State Historical Society that \"The total of losses from September 12, 1868, to February 9, 1869, exclusive of casualties incident to military operations, was 158 men murdered, sixteen wounded and forty-one scalped. Three scouts were killed, fourteen women outraged, one man was captured, four women and twenty-four children were carried off. Nearly all of these losses occurred in what we then called western Kansas, although the Saline, Solomon and Republican do not seem so very far west now\".<ref name=\"moore\">Moore, January 19, 1897, p. 350.</ref>\n\nOn August 19, 1868, Colonel [[Edward W.

According to Little Rock's account, a war party of about 200 Cheyenne from a camp above the forks of Walnut Creek departed camp intending to go out against the Pawnee. Instead, they raided white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers. Some of the warriors returned to Black Kettle's camp. Little Rock learned from them what took place.

When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the fighting began I have not been able to keep them all at home.

Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others seized the Indians' property and horses.

Morrison when they arrived at [[Fort Dodge, Kansas|Fort Dodge]] with the Cheyenne prisoners.<ref name=\"hardorff-282\">Hardorff 2006, p. 282.</ref> In a letter to Indian Agent Col. [[Edward W. Wynkoop]] on December 14, 1868, Morrison wrote,\n\n<blockquote>John Smith, John Poysell [Poisal], and Jack Fitzpatrick have got in today. John S. was not in the [Washita] fight, but John P. and Jack were. They all agree in stating that the official reports of the fight were very much exaggerated; that there were not over twenty bucks killed; the rest, about 40, were women and children.<ref name=\"morrison-letter\"/></blockquote>The Cheyenne prisoners, interviewed by Gen. Sheridan at Camp Supply, reported 13 Cheyenne men, two Sioux, and one Arapaho killed at the Washita,<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> a figure which Sheridan subsequently reported to Bvt. Maj. Gen. Nichols.<ref name=\"sheridan-1868-12-03\"/> The journalist DeB. Randolph Keim interviewed the women prisoners with the help of interpreter Richard Curtis. He obtained the names of those killed and arrived at the same figure of 13 Cheyenne, two Sioux, and one Arapaho killed.<ref name=\"keim-1868-12-24\"/> Later information from various Cheyenne sources, most of them independent of each other, tended to confirm the figures given by the Cheyenne women prisoners.<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/> Few of the military reports noted casualties among the women and children. Custer acknowledged in his report, \"In the excitement of the fight, as well as in self-defence, it so happened that some of the squaws and a few of the children were killed and wounded....\"<ref name=\"custer-1868-11-28\"/>\n\nAfter Custer and Sheridan visited the battlefield in December, Custer revised his initial estimate of 103 warriors killed upward. He wrote from Fort Cobb,\n<blockquote>The Indians admit a loss of 140 killed, besides a heavy loss of wounded. This, with the Indian prisoners we have in our possession, makes the entire loss of the Indian in killed, wounded, and missing not far from 300.<ref name=\"custer-1868-12-22\"/></blockquote>\n\nHoig points out that if true, the number would mean that virtually everyone in Black Kettle's village was killed or captured.<ref name=\"hoig-200\"/> Greene states, \"Custer's figures were inflated, and the specific sources of his information remain unknown.\"<ref name=\"greene-136\"/> \n\nHardorff notes questions about this total.\n<blockquote>This new number was based on information obtained from two imprisoned Kiowa chiefs at Fort Cobb who faced death by hanging. In view of their predicament, it seems likely that these men would have said anything to avoid the gallows. But such skepticism is not warranted in the case of the Washita prisoners. The Cheyenne women were allowed to mingle freely with the officers and knew many of them on an intimate basis. They were assured good treatment and had no apparent reason to distort their statements about dead kinsmen.<ref name=\"hardorff-78n15\"/></blockquote>\n\nGreene finds the Cheyenne and other Indian estimates most reliable. He writes, \"As might be expected, the best estimates must come from the people who suffered the losses,\" though noting, \"even these do not agree.\"<ref name=\"greene-136\"/> Utley, however, writes, \"Indian calculations \u2014 a dozen warriors and twice as many women and children killed \u2013 are as improbably low as Custer's are high.\"<ref name=\"utley-70\">Utley 2001, p. 70.</ref> Hoig writes, \"Even though the number 103 was not arrived at by a precise battlefield count, it is a definite figure which has already been placed on historical markers of the battlefield. Since it will likely never be proved absolutely incorrect, the figure will undoubtedly remain accepted as the number of Indians killed by Custer at the Washita. History should make it clear, however, that the dead were by no means all warriors who were met in open battle and defeated.\"<ref name=\"hoig-201\">Hoig 1980, p. 201.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the Cheyenne accounts provide names of men killed at the Washita.<ref name=\"keim-1868-12-24\"/><ref name=\"bent-1913-08-28\"/><ref name=\"grinnell-1916-10-03\"/><ref name=\"bent-1916-12-04\"/><ref name=\"hyde\">Hyde 1968, p. 322.</ref> In his book on the Washita, Greene provides an appendix of \"Known Village Fatalities at the Washita.\"  He compiled a list of all unique names, for a total of 40 men, 12 women (of whom 11 are unidentified), and six unidentified children. Greene notes that some individuals might have more than one name, so some entries might be duplicates.<ref name=\"greene-212-214\">Greene 2004, pp. 212\u2013214.</ref> Using the same sources, Richard G. Hardorff has compiled a \"Composite List of Names.\" It partially reconciles multiple names (or multiple translations of the same name) among the different sources; for example, the Mexican ''Pilan'', with Indian names White Bear and Tall White Man; or Bitter Man/Cranky Man, also known as Bad Man. Writes Hardorff, \"Some of the dead may have been identified by their birth name by one informant and by their nickname by another.

Davis]]\n\nFollowing the event, a controversy arose as to whether the event was best described as a military victory or as a massacre. This discussion endures among historians to this day.<ref name=Hardorff-29/>\n\nThe [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Bureau]] described the event as a \"massacre of innocent Indians\", and humanitarian groups denounced it as \"cold-blooded butchery\".<ref name=Hardorff-29/> The Cheyenne survivors considered it a horrifying event that gravely impacted their lives and community; the loss of many tribal elders, in particular, was profoundly damaging to Cheyenne families and society. Modern Cheyenne consider the event a massacre and are campaigning to change the name of the historical site to reflect that view.<ref>Hardorff 2006 p.31</ref>\n\nCuster himself did not consider Washita a massacre, stating that he did not kill every Indian in the village, though he said his forces could not avoid killing a few women in the middle of the hard fight. He said that some women took up weapons and were subsequently killed and that he took women and children prisoners.<ref name=\"greene-189\">Greene 2004, page 189.</ref> In his book about the encounter, published in 2004 for the National Park Service, historian Jerome Greene concluded that \"Soldiers evidently took measures to protect the women and children.\"<ref name=\"greene-189\"/>\n\nBy early December 1868, the attack had provoked debate and criticism in the press. In the December 9 ''Leavenworth Evening Bulletin'', an article noted: \"Gen. S. Sandford and Tappan, and Col. Taylor of the Indian Peace Commission, unite in the opinion that the late battle with the Indians was simply an attack upon peaceful bands, which were on the march to their new reservations\". The December 14 ''[[New York Tribune]]'' reported, \"Col. Wynkoop, agent for the Cheyenne and Arapahos Indians, has published his letter of resignation. He regards Gen. Custer's late fight as simply a massacre, and says that Black Kettle and his band, friendly Indians, were, when attacked, on their way to their reservation.\" The scout James S. Morrison wrote Indian Agent Col. Wynkoop that twice as many women and children as warriors had been killed during the attack.\n\nIn Custer's direct frontal assault on an armed and ostensibly hostile encampment, the only fatality in the 7th Cavalry in the fighting in the village itself was squadron commander Captain [[Louis McLane Hamilton]], a grandson of American [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]] [[Alexander Hamilton]].<ref name=\"hatch-81\"/><ref name=okla>{{cite journal |title=In Memory of Captain Louis McLane Hamilton |work=Chronicles of Oklahoma |volume=37 |year=1959 |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |pages=355\u2013359 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v037/v037p354.pdf }}</ref> The rest of the dead were with the detached command of Maj. Joel Elliott, who (as noted above) were killed more than a mile from the fighting in the village.<ref name=\"hatch-81\">Hatch 2002, page 81</ref> Companies A and D, composed of 120 officers and men, suffered only four wounded in the assault, and attacking Companies C and K, also totaling 120 officers and men, suffered no casualties.<ref name=\"hatch-81\"/>\n\nHistorian [[Paul Andrew Hutton]] wrote, \"Although the fight on the Washita was most assuredly one-sided, it was not a massacre. Black Kettle's Cheyennes were not unarmed innocents living under the impression that they were not at war. Several of Black Kettle's warriors had recently fought the soldiers, and the chief had been informed by Hazen that there could be no peace until he surrendered to Sheridan. The soldiers were not under orders to kill everyone, for Custer personally stopped the slaying of noncombatants, and fifty-three prisoners were taken by the troops.\"<ref>''The Custer Reader'', Norman: [[University of Oklahoma Press]], p. 102</ref>\n\nHistorian Joseph B. Thoburn considers the destruction of Black Kettle's village too one-sided to be called a battle. He reasons that had a superior force of Indians attacked a white settlement containing no more people than were in Black Kettle's camp, with like results, the incident would doubtless have been heralded as \"a massacre\".<ref name=\"Hardorff-29\">Hardorff 2006, p. 29.</ref> Historian Stan Hoig argues that the conflict fit the definition of a massacre because a group of people, even one in possession of weapons as the Cheyenne were, were killed \"indiscriminately, mercilessly and in large numbers\".<ref name=Hardorff30>Hardorff 2006, p. 30.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nDuring the late 20th century, a time of activism for Native American and minority [[civil rights]], and protests about the [[Vietnam War]], film and other media reflected changes in historians' perspective on the Battle of Washita River. They also used the event to reflect on contemporary issues. In the 1970 film ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'',<ref name=\"LBMfilm\">''Little Big Man'' (film). Directed by Arthur Penn. Based on novel by Thomas Berger. Written by Calder Willingham. Produced by Stuart Millar. Performers Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Chief Dan George, Martin Balsam, Richard Mulligan.

Connell]]'s non-fiction book of the same name, presented the battle from the points of view of Kate Bighead (Cheyenne) and [[Elizabeth Bacon Custer|Elizabeth Custer]]. It depicted Chief Black Kettle as being killed by Custer's troopers, and Custer's not waiting for word of Major Elliott. The fourth episode of the 2005 TV miniseries ''[[Into the West (TV miniseries)|Into the West]]''  depicts Custer attacking and Black Kettle fleeing the village.\n\nThe television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' aired a special double-episode entitled \"Washita\" on April 29, 1995.<ref name=\"drquinn\">\"Washita.\" ''Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman'' (television series). CBS Broadcasting, Inc. Original broadcast April 29, 1995.</ref> The episode set the scene of the Washita attack in Colorado instead of Oklahoma, the site of the battle. It fictionalized Custer as deliberately misleading Colorado settlers about the difference between Black Kettle and his band, depicted as peaceful, and the Dog Soldiers, who were attacking farms and railroad crews. Lead character Dr. Michaela \"Mike\" Quinn made futile attempts to argue with Custer and to warn Black Kettle of impending massacre.\n\nIn the 2003 film ''[[The Last Samurai]]'',<ref name=\"lastsamurai\">''The Last Samurai'' (film). Directed by Edward Zwick. Written by John Logan, Edward Zwick, and Marshall Herskovitz. Produced by Tom Cruise. Performers Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe.
