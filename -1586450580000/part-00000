It is part of the [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] [[Wheeling metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], and Wheeling is across the Ohio to the east. The population was 4,278 at the 2010 census, having had its peak in 1920. The city is located along the [[Ohio River]].\n\nThe [[Bellaire Bridge|Bellaire toll bridge]] (now abandoned and closed) was filmed in the 1991 motion picture ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]].'' The curved railroad viaduct and bridge over the Ohio, the [[B & O Railroad Viaduct]], were featured in the 2010 film ''[[Unstoppable (2010 film)|Unstoppable]]'' and is a registered historic structure.  A logo featuring the historic stone bridge is featured on official village paperwork as well as on police uniforms,  and was designed by former resident Michael A. Massa,  creator of the Belmont county seal, under the Administration of former City Mayor Fitch.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native Americans===\n[[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]] occupied numerous areas along the Ohio River and built complex earthworks. None of their distinctive prehistoric remains has been found within the present-day city limits.\n\nThe [[Mingo]], [[Shawnee]] and [[Delaware]] were historic tribes who inhabited the area at the time of European encounter and settlement. The latter were involved in the Northwest Indian Wars after settlement began in the post-Revolutionary War years. Unhappy that the United States had ignored their grievances in the 1789 [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], the Indians tried to push out the settlers over the next several years.\n\n===Europeans===\nThe first documented European visitors to the Ohio River Valley and this area were French trappers and priests in the early and mid-1700s. They were impressed with the river's heavily wooded and hilly shores, and with the abundance of fish and wildlife.\n\n===Beginnings of Bellaire===\nThe young [[George Washington]] had explored and surveyed lands in the Ohio River Valley before the Revolutionary War. After the war, he supported plans to have the federal government make land grants to veterans as payment for their services, in lieu of cash.\n\nThe ownership of the land changed hands sporadically, through speculation and conflicts over land deeds. John Rodefer and Jacob Davis purchased a shared majority of land for a village, which they realized in 1834. They surveyed six acres of building lot sites north of what is today Twenty-Seventh Street West toward Belmont Street. They named it Bell Air after Davis's former home in [[Maryland]]. Soon after, other settlers began to buy lots, and the town began to grow.\n\nThe first big boost for growth came with the construction of the Central Ohio Railway in 1853, later absorbed by the [[Baltimore and Ohio]], and the Stone Viaduct Bridge (opened in 1871) that carried it to [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], Virginia. The B&O reached Wheeling in January 1853, having started construction at [[Baltimore]], Maryland in 1827. It was the means by which the East Coast city, a port on [[Chesapeake Bay]], could connect with western markets and compete with New York City and the [[Erie Canal]]. Col. John Sullivan campaigned for the connection from Bellaire. The town was renamed Bellaire by the railroad company.\n\nBellaire had some strategic importance during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Its location on the Ohio River meant that it was on the border between the state of Ohio (pro-Union) and the state of Virginia (voted to secede from the Union). Railroads on both sides of the river added to the strategic significance. For these reasons, Camp Jefferson was established in Bellaire as a military training camp, and was often departure point for union soldiers using the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to move to the southeast.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Camp Jefferson\n  |publisher=Ohio Historical Society\n  |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=667&nm=Camp-Jefferson\n  |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===Glass City era===\nBellaire gained the title of \"Glass City\" for the period of 1870 to 1885.  The area had modern transportation, an energy source, and a skilled workforce. The transportation infrastructure included the Ohio River, the National Road,<ref>{{cite book |last=McKelvey |title=Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio and Representative Citizens |year=1903 |accessdate= |date= |month= |publisher=Biographic Publishing Company |location=Chicago, IL |isbn= |pages=68\u201369 |ref= }}</ref> and railroads, including the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Central Ohio Railroad. Coal was the local energy source, as Belmont County was part of the eastern Ohio coal region.  A skilled workforce was located within the region, since glass had been made across the river in Wheeling since the 1820s.\n\nSome of the glass-making facilities of the time were [[Belmont Glass Company|Belmont Glass Works]], Bellaire Window Glass Company, Rodefer-Gleason Glass Company, Star Glass Works, National Glass Manufacturing Company, Bellaire Goblet Works, Union Window Glass Company, and Enterprise Window Glass Company.  In the next decade, the list also included the Bellaire Bottle Company, the Century Glass Company, and the Imperial Glass Company.<ref>{{cite book |last=McKelvey |title=Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio and Representative Citizens |year=1903 |accessdate= |date= |month= |publisher=Biographic Publishing Company |location=Chicago, IL |isbn= |page=170 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe discovery of natural gas in the [[Findlay, Ohio]] area in the late 1880s drew many manufacturers from Bellaire to the west, where the region around [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Fostoria, Ohio|Fostoria]] became the new center for Ohio's glass industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.fostoria.oh.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4&Itemid=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001034332/http://www.ci.fostoria.oh.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4&Itemid=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 October 2006|title=Fostoria Ohio Official Website \u2013 Fostoria Glass|accessdate=17 Nov 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Glass Museum====\nAmong dozens of local manufacturers, the Imperial Glass Company, founded in 1901 by Edward Muhleman, a riverman and financier, first made glass in 1904. It specialized in the mass production of attractive and affordable pressed-glass tableware, using continuous-feed [[melting tank]]s.  One of the largest American handmade glass manufacturers during the 20th century, Imperial also produced blown glass, several lines of art glass, and its trademark \"Candlewick\" pattern.  Bellaire's glassmaking era finally ended when the \"Big I\" closed its door in 1984. The building was razed in 1995. Its diverse products remain highly prized by glass collectors.\n\nThe Imperial Glass Museum contains displays of Imperial Glassware, as well as other Bellaire glassware, from the Ohio Valley Glass and Artifacts Museum. The museum is dedicated to the glassware and people who worked at Imperial. The National Imperial Glass (NIG) Collectors Society intends to keep alive the story of Imperial through the museum. Imperial was one of the largest and most diverse of the companies that made up the American handmade glass industry.\n\n==Geography==\nBellaire is located at {{coord|40|0|59|N|80|44|44|W|type:city}} (40.016257, \u221280.745627).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|1.68|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.65|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 1466\n|1870= 4033\n|1880= 8025\n|1890= 9934\n|1900= 9912\n|1910= 12946\n|1920= 15061\n|1930= 13327\n|1940= 13799\n|1950= 12573\n|1960= 11502\n|1970= 9655\n|1980= 8231\n|1990= 6028\n|2000= 4892\n|2010= 4278\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4064\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDuring the [[Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike of 1894]], the National Guard was called up to protect the region's coal mines, and on June 13, there was a violent clash between strikers and national guard troops just west of town.<ref>Coal Strike may Continue \u2013 But Few Miners Willing to Accept Lower Wages, [https://www.nytimes.com/1894/06/14/archives/coal-strike-may-continue-but-few-miners-willing-to-accept-lower.html New York Times], Thursday June 14, 1894; page 4.</ref>\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 4,278 people, 1,836 households, and 1,056 families living in the village.

Ohio|Belmont County]], [[Ohio]], United States. It is part of the [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] [[Wheeling metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], and Wheeling is across the Ohio to the east. The population was 4,278 at the 2010 census, having had its peak in 1920. The city is located along the [[Ohio River]].\n\nThe [[Bellaire Bridge|Bellaire toll bridge]] (now abandoned and closed) was filmed in the 1991 motion picture ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]].'' The curved railroad viaduct and bridge over the Ohio, the [[B & O Railroad Viaduct]], were featured in the 2010 film ''[[Unstoppable (2010 film)|Unstoppable]]'' and is a registered historic structure.  A logo featuring the historic stone bridge is featured on official village paperwork as well as on police uniforms,  and was designed by former resident Michael A. Massa,  creator of the Belmont county seal, under the Administration of former City Mayor Fitch.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native Americans===\n[[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]] occupied numerous areas along the Ohio River and built complex earthworks. None of their distinctive prehistoric remains has been found within the present-day city limits.\n\nThe [[Mingo]], [[Shawnee]] and [[Delaware]] were historic tribes who inhabited the area at the time of European encounter and settlement. The latter were involved in the Northwest Indian Wars after settlement began in the post-Revolutionary War years. Unhappy that the United States had ignored their grievances in the 1789 [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], the Indians tried to push out the settlers over the next several years.\n\n===Europeans===\nThe first documented European visitors to the Ohio River Valley and this area were French trappers and priests in the early and mid-1700s. They were impressed with the river's heavily wooded and hilly shores, and with the abundance of fish and wildlife.\n\n===Beginnings of Bellaire===\nThe young [[George Washington]] had explored and surveyed lands in the Ohio River Valley before the Revolutionary War. After the war, he supported plans to have the federal government make land grants to veterans as payment for their services, in lieu of cash.\n\nThe ownership of the land changed hands sporadically, through speculation and conflicts over land deeds. John Rodefer and Jacob Davis purchased a shared majority of land for a village, which they realized in 1834. They surveyed six acres of building lot sites north of what is today Twenty-Seventh Street West toward Belmont Street. They named it Bell Air after Davis's former home in [[Maryland]]. Soon after, other settlers began to buy lots, and the town began to grow.\n\nThe first big boost for growth came with the construction of the Central Ohio Railway in 1853, later absorbed by the [[Baltimore and Ohio]], and the Stone Viaduct Bridge (opened in 1871) that carried it to [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], Virginia. The B&O reached Wheeling in January 1853, having started construction at [[Baltimore]], Maryland in 1827. It was the means by which the East Coast city, a port on [[Chesapeake Bay]], could connect with western markets and compete with New York City and the [[Erie Canal]]. Col. John Sullivan campaigned for the connection from Bellaire. The town was renamed Bellaire by the railroad company.\n\nBellaire had some strategic importance during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Its location on the Ohio River meant that it was on the border between the state of Ohio (pro-Union) and the state of Virginia (voted to secede from the Union). Railroads on both sides of the river added to the strategic significance. For these reasons, Camp Jefferson was established in Bellaire as a military training camp, and was often departure point for union soldiers using the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to move to the southeast.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Camp Jefferson\n  |publisher=Ohio Historical Society\n  |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=667&nm=Camp-Jefferson\n  |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===Glass City era===\nBellaire gained the title of \"Glass City\" for the period of 1870 to 1885.  The area had modern transportation, an energy source, and a skilled workforce. The transportation infrastructure included the Ohio River, the National Road,<ref>{{cite book |last=McKelvey |title=Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio and Representative Citizens |year=1903 |accessdate= |date= |month= |publisher=Biographic Publishing Company |location=Chicago, IL |isbn= |pages=68\u201369 |ref= }}</ref> and railroads, including the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Central Ohio Railroad. Coal was the local energy source, as Belmont County was part of the eastern Ohio coal region.  A skilled workforce was located within the region, since glass had been made across the river in Wheeling since the 1820s.\n\nSome of the glass-making facilities of the time were [[Belmont Glass Company|Belmont Glass Works]], Bellaire Window Glass Company, Rodefer-Gleason Glass Company, Star Glass Works, National Glass Manufacturing Company, Bellaire Goblet Works, Union Window Glass Company, and Enterprise Window Glass Company.  In the next decade, the list also included the Bellaire Bottle Company, the Century Glass Company, and the Imperial Glass Company.<ref>{{cite book |last=McKelvey |title=Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio and Representative Citizens |year=1903 |accessdate= |date= |month= |publisher=Biographic Publishing Company |location=Chicago, IL |isbn= |page=170 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe discovery of natural gas in the [[Findlay, Ohio]] area in the late 1880s drew many manufacturers from Bellaire to the west, where the region around [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Fostoria, Ohio|Fostoria]] became the new center for Ohio's glass industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.fostoria.oh.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4&Itemid=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001034332/http://www.ci.fostoria.oh.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4&Itemid=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 October 2006|title=Fostoria Ohio Official Website \u2013 Fostoria Glass|accessdate=17 Nov 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Glass Museum====\nAmong dozens of local manufacturers, the Imperial Glass Company, founded in 1901 by Edward Muhleman, a riverman and financier, first made glass in 1904. It specialized in the mass production of attractive and affordable pressed-glass tableware, using continuous-feed [[melting tank]]s.  One of the largest American handmade glass manufacturers during the 20th century, Imperial also produced blown glass, several lines of art glass, and its trademark \"Candlewick\" pattern.  Bellaire's glassmaking era finally ended when the \"Big I\" closed its door in 1984. The building was razed in 1995. Its diverse products remain highly prized by glass collectors.\n\nThe Imperial Glass Museum contains displays of Imperial Glassware, as well as other Bellaire glassware, from the Ohio Valley Glass and Artifacts Museum. The museum is dedicated to the glassware and people who worked at Imperial. The National Imperial Glass (NIG) Collectors Society intends to keep alive the story of Imperial through the museum. Imperial was one of the largest and most diverse of the companies that made up the American handmade glass industry.\n\n==Geography==\nBellaire is located at {{coord|40|0|59|N|80|44|44|W|type:city}} (40.016257, \u221280.745627).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|1.68|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|1.65|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 1466\n|1870= 4033\n|1880= 8025\n|1890= 9934\n|1900= 9912\n|1910= 12946\n|1920= 15061\n|1930= 13327\n|1940= 13799\n|1950= 12573\n|1960= 11502\n|1970= 9655\n|1980= 8231\n|1990= 6028\n|2000= 4892\n|2010= 4278\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4064\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDuring the [[Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike of 1894]], the National Guard was called up to protect the region's coal mines, and on June 13, there was a violent clash between strikers and national guard troops just west of town.<ref>Coal Strike may Continue \u2013 But Few Miners Willing to Accept Lower Wages, [https://www.nytimes.com/1894/06/14/archives/coal-strike-may-continue-but-few-miners-willing-to-accept-lower.html New York Times], Thursday June 14, 1894; page 4.</ref>\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 4,278 people, 1,836 households, and 1,056 families living in the village.

A competing hypothesis (\"[[multiple discovery]]\") is that most inventions and scientific discoveries are made independently and simultaneously by multiple inventors and scientists.\n\nThe multiple discovery hypothesis might be especially relevant in the development of mathematics since mathematical knowledge is highly unified and any advances that happen need to be built from previously established results through a process of deduction, as a general rule.  For instance, the development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] into a systematic discipline did not occur until the development of [[analytic geometry]], the former being credited to both [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and the latter to both [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Genius]]\n*[[Great man theory]]\n*[[Universal mind|Hive mind]]\n*[[List of multiple discoveries]]\n*[[Multiple discovery]]\n*[[People known as the father or mother of something]]\n*[[Scientific priority]]\n*[[Scientific theory]]\n*[[:Category:Discovery and invention controversies]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''Hypothesis and experiment in the early development of Kekuleacute's Benzene theory'' Alan J.

A competing hypothesis (\"[[multiple discovery]]\") is that most inventions and scientific discoveries are made independently and simultaneously by multiple inventors and scientists.\n\nThe multiple discovery hypothesis might be especially relevant in the development of mathematics since mathematical knowledge is highly unified and any advances that happen need to be built from previously established results through a process of deduction, as a general rule.  For instance, the development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] into a systematic discipline did not occur until the development of [[analytic geometry]], the former being credited to both [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and the latter to both [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Genius]]\n*[[Great man theory]]\n*[[Universal mind|Hive mind]]\n*[[List of multiple discoveries]]\n*[[Multiple discovery]]\n*[[People known as the father or mother of something]]\n*[[Scientific priority]]\n*[[Scientific theory]]\n*[[:Category:Discovery and invention controversies]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''Hypothesis and experiment in the early development of Kekuleacute's Benzene theory'' Alan J.
