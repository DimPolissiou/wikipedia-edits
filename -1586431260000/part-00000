{"title_page": "List of musical symbols", "text_new": "{{short description|none}}\n{{Selfref|For the use of musical symbols on Wikipedia, see [[Help:Musical symbols]].}}\n'''Musical symbols''' are marks and symbols used since about the 13th century in [[musical notation]] of [[sheet music|musical scores]]. Some are used to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[tempo]], [[metre (music)|metre]], [[Duration (music)|duration]] and [[articulation (music)|articulation]] of a [[musical note or a section (music passage) of music. In some cases, symbols provide information about the form of a piece (e.g., how many repeats of a section) or about how to play the note (e.g., with violin family instruments, a note may be bowed or plucked). Some symbols are instrument-specific notation giving the performer information about which finger, hand or foot to use.\n\n==Lines==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px; padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''<br />The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word \"stave\" is often used.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''<br /> These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''<br />These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures''). Also used for changes in [[time signature]]. Bar lines are extended to connect multiple staves in certain types of music, such as for keyboard or harp, and in conductor scores, but such extensions are not used for other types of music, such as vocal scores.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-doublebar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Double bar line, Double barline'''<br />These separate two sections of music, or are placed before a change in [[key signature]] and/or [[time signature]].\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-endbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Bold double bar line, Bold double barline'''<br />These indicate the conclusion of a movement or an entire composition.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-dottedbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Dotted bar line, Dotted barline'''<br />Subdivides long measures of complex meter into shorter segments for ease of reading, usually according to natural rhythmic subdivisions.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Staff-bracket.jpg|30px]]\n|'''Bracket'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that sound simultaneously. In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).\n|-\n| [[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]\n|'''Brace'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.<ref>[https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/musicengraving/engraving-convention/braces-and-bracket/ \"Music Notation and Engraving \u2013 Braces and Bracket], [[Colorado College]] Music Department</ref> Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an '''accolade''' in some old texts) varies in design and style.\n|}\n\n== Clefs ==\n{{main|Clef}}\nClefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''<br />The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996>{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=0-88284-768-6}}</ref> The treble clef is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. \n|-\n| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''<br />These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the \"alto clef\". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a \"movable\" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a \"tenor clef\". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.<br /> Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''<br />The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996 /> Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a \"bass clef\". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here. In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Neutral clef'''<br />Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.\n|-\n| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Octave clef'''<br />Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.\n|-\n| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]\n|'''Tablature'''<br />For stringed instruments, such as the guitar, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.\n|}\n\n== Notes and rests ==\n\n{{main|Note value}}\n[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values. The whole note is the reference value, and the other notes are named (in American usage) in comparison; i.e., a quarter note is a quarter of the length of a whole note.\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Note\n!width=*|British name / American name\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Rest\n|-\n| [[File:Music-octwholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Maxima (music)|Large (Latin: Maxima) / Octuple whole note]]'''<ref name=256th/>\n| [[File:Music-octwholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-quadwholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Longa (music)|Long / Quadruple whole note]]'''<ref name=256th/>\n| [[File:Music-quadwholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-doublewholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Double whole note|Breve / Double whole note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-doublewholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-wholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Whole note|Semibreve / Whole note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-wholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-halfnote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Half note|Minim / Half note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-halfrest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-quarternote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Quarter note|Crotchet / Quarter note]]'''<ref>Examples of the older form are found in the work of English music publishers up to the 20th century, e.g., W.

In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text \u2013 [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer about the lyrics. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Dotted note]]'''<br />Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' \u00d7 (2 \u2212 2<sup>''\u2212n''</sup>)}}.\n|-\n| [[File:Ghost note.png]]\n|'''[[Ghost note]]'''<br />A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played. It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval. Composers will primarily use this notation to represent percussive pitches.  This notation is also used in parts where spoken words are used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''<br />Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation. Also called ''gathered rest'' or ''multi-bar rest''.\n|}\n\n== Breaks ==\n{| style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-breath.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Breath mark]]'''<br />This symbol tells the performer to take a breath (or make a slight pause for non-wind instruments). This pause usually does not affect the overall tempo. For bowed instruments, it indicates to lift the bow and play the next note with a downward (or upward, if marked) bow.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-caesura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Caesura]]'''<br />A pause during which time is not counted.\n|}\n\n== Accidentals and key signatures ==\n{{main|Accidental (music)|Key signature|Circle of fifths}}\n\n=== Common accidentals ===\n[[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] modify the pitch of the notes that follow them on the same staff position within a measure, unless cancelled by an additional accidental.\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-flat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Flat (music)|Flat]]'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one [[semitone]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Sharp (music)|Sharp]]'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one semitone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-natural.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Natural (music)|Natural]]'''<br />Cancels a previous accidental, or modifies the pitch of a sharp or flat as defined by the prevailing key signature (such as F-sharp in the key of G major, for example).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-doubleflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Double flat]]'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by two chromatic semitones.

Usually used when the note to modify is already sharpened by the key signature.\n|}\n\n===Key signatures===\n[[Key signature]]s define the prevailing [[Key (music)|key]] of the music that follows, thus avoiding the use of accidentals for many notes. If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat key signature'''<br />'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature, starting with the leftmost, i.e., B{{music|\u266d}}, and proceeding to the right; for example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B{{music|\u266d}} major/G minor, and all B's and E's are \"flatted\" (US) or \"flattened\" (UK), i.e., lowered to B{{music|\u266d}} and E{{music|\u266d}}.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. I,24 \"at least one note has to be sharpened or flattened\"</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:C-sharp-major a-sharp-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp key signature'''<br />'''''Raises''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature, also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four sharps are used, the key is E major/C{{music|\u266f}} minor, and the corresponding pitches are raised.\n|}\n\n=== Quarter tones ===\nThere is no universally accepted notation for [[microtonal music]], with varying systems being used depending on the situation. A common notation for [[quarter tone]]s involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demiflat'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demisharp'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)<br />Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.\n|}\n\nA symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.\n\nIn [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.\n\n== Time signatures ==\n{{main|Time signature}}\n[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is \"marked off\" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 simple time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as \"three-four time\" or \"three-quarter time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 compound time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as \"Six-Eight Time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Common time]]'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented \"imperfect\" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|80px]]\n|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''<br />Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters \"'''M.M.'''\", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].\n|}\n\n== Note relationships ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''<br />Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical \u2013 that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''<br />Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.<br />Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.<br />A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''<br />A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tuplet]]'''<br />A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''<br />Several notes sounded simultaneously (\"solid\" or \"block\"), or in succession (\"broken\"). Two-note chords are called a '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]''' or an [[Interval (music)|'''interval''']]; three-note chords built from generic third intervals are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''<br />A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a \"broken chord\" or \"rolled chord\".\n|}\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{main|Dynamics (music)}}\nDynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]\n|'''Pianississimo'''<ref name=ppp group=D>Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra \"iss\" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo'').

Can be extended in the same manner as crescendo.\n|}\n<references group=D />\nOther commonly used dynamics build upon these values. For example, \"''pianississimo''\" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) means \"so softly as to be almost inaudible\", and \"''fortississimo''\" ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) means \"extremely loud\".  Dynamics are relative, and the meaning of each level is at the discretion of the performer or, in the case of ensembles, the conductor. However, modern legislation to curb high noise levels in the workplace in an effort to prevent damage to musicians' hearing has posed a challenge to the interpretation of very loud dynamics in some large orchestral works, as noise levels within the orchestra itself can easily exceed safe levels when all instruments are playing at full volume<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html \"No Fortissimo? Symphony Told to Keep It Down\"] by [[Sarah Lyall]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (20 April 2008)</ref>. \n\nA small {{serif|'''''s'''''}} in front of the dynamic notations means ''subito'' (meaning \"suddenly\" in Italian), and means that the dynamic is to change to the new notation rapidly. Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).\n\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]\n|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''<br />A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (''forte''), then immediately softly (''piano'').\n|}\n\nAnother value that rarely appears is ''[[niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means \"nothing\". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate \"fade out to nothing\".\n\n== Articulation marks ==\n[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccato]]'''<br />This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''<br />Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking\u2019s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''<br />Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tenuto]]'''<br />This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a degree of emphasis, especially when combined with dynamic markings to indicate a change in loudness, or combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').\n|-\n| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Marcato]]'''<br />''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge). In organ notation, this means ''play a pedal note with the toe''. Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''<br />A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires, but is often set as twice the original value of the designated notes.\n|}\n\n== Ornaments ==\nOrnaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]][[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''<br />A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a \"shake\". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill. In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn. In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29</ref> In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a [[tremolo]]. In French baroque notation, the trill, or ''tremblement'', was notated as a small cross above or beside the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Upper [[mordent]]'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the next higher note (according to key signature) then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a \"shake\" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In much music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[File:Music-turn-2.svg|60px]][[File:Music-turn (inverted).png|60px]][[File:Music-inverted turn.png|60px]]}}\n|'''[[Turn (music)|Turn]]'''<br />When placed directly above the note, the turn (also known as a ''gruppetto'') indicates a sequence of upper auxiliary note, principal note, lower auxiliary note, and a return to the principal note. When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''<br />The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''<br />The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged. Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).\n|}\n\n== Octave signs ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Ottava'''<br />''8<sup>va</sup>'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') is placed {{em|above}} the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to play the passage one [[octave]] higher.<br />When this sign (or in recent notation practice, an ''8<sup>vb</sup>'' \u2013 both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed {{em|below}} the staff, it indicates to play the passage one octave lower.<ref>George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W.

A ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' sign ''below'' the staff indicates ''play the passage two octaves lower''.\n|}\n''8<sup>va</sup>'' and ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' are sometimes abbreviated further to ''8'' and ''15''. When they appear below the staff, the word ''bassa'' is sometimes added.\n\n== Repetition and codas ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tremolo.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music Tremolo shortcut.jpg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tremolo]]'''<br />A rapidly repeated note. If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as \"as fast as possible\", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.<br />In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussion and some untuned percussion instruments such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.<br />The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''<br />Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once. If there is no left repeat sign, the right repeat sign sends the performer back to the start of the piece or the nearest double bar.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-simile.svg|100px]]\n|'''Simile marks'''<br />Denote that preceding groups of beats or measures are to be repeated. In the examples here, the first usually means to repeat the previous measure, and the second usually means to repeat the previous two measures.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-volte.svg|100px]]\n|'''Volta brackets''' ('''1st and 2nd endings''', or '''1st- and 2nd-time bars''')<br />A repeated passage is to be played with different endings on different playings; it is possible to have more than two endings (1st, 2nd, 3rd ...).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dacapo.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Da capo]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From top\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music from its beginning. This is usually followed by ''al fine'' (lit. \"to the end\"), which means to repeat to the word ''fine'' and stop, or ''al coda'' (lit. \"to the coda (sign)\"), which means repeat to the coda sign and then jump forward.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dalsegno.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Dal segno]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From the sign\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music starting at the nearest ''segno''. This is followed by ''al fine'' or ''al coda'' just as with ''da capo''.\n|-\n| [[File:SegnoTeken.svg|50px]]\n|'''Segno'''<br />Mark used with ''dal segno''.\n|-\n| [[File:Coda sign.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Coda (music)|Coda]]'''<br />Indicates a forward jump in the music to its ending passage, marked with the same sign. Only used after playing through a ''D.S. al coda'' (Dal segno al coda) or ''D.C. al coda'' (Da capo al coda).\n|}\n\n== Instrument-specific notation ==\n=== Bowed string instruments ===\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bart\u00f3k pizzicato|Left-hand pizzicato]]''' or '''[[Stopped note]]'''<br />A note on a stringed instrument where the string is plucked with the left hand (the hand that usually stops the strings) rather than bowed. On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a \"stopped note\" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn). In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be \"choked\" (muted with the hand).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''Snap pizzicato'''<br />On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it \"snap\" against the frame.

On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note \"open\" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''<br />On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Down bow''' or '''Gi\u00f9 arco'''<br />Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with a downstroke.\n|}\n\n=== Guitar ===\n\nThe guitar has a [[fingerpicking]] notation system derived from the names of the fingers in Spanish or Latin.

Some are used to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[tempo]], [[metre (music)|metre]], [[Duration (music)|duration]] and [[articulation (music)|articulation]] of a [[musical note|note]] or a [[section (music)|passage]] of music. In some cases, symbols provide information about the form of a piece (e.g., how many repeats of a section) or about how to play the note (e.g., with violin family instruments, a note may be bowed or plucked). Some symbols are instrument-specific notation giving the performer information about which finger, hand or foot to use.\n\n==Lines==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px; padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''<br />The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word \"stave\" is often used.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''<br /> These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''<br />These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures''). Also used for changes in [[time signature]]. Bar lines are extended to connect multiple staves in certain types of music, such as for keyboard or harp, and in conductor scores, but such extensions are not used for other types of music, such as vocal scores.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-doublebar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Double bar line, Double barline'''<br />These separate two sections of music, or are placed before a change in [[key signature]] and/or [[time signature]].\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-endbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Bold double bar line, Bold double barline'''<br />These indicate the conclusion of a movement or an entire composition.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-dottedbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Dotted bar line, Dotted barline'''<br />Subdivides long measures of complex meter into shorter segments for ease of reading, usually according to natural rhythmic subdivisions.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Staff-bracket.jpg|30px]]\n|'''Bracket'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that sound simultaneously. In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).\n|-\n| [[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]\n|'''Brace'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.<ref>[https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/musicengraving/engraving-convention/braces-and-bracket/ \"Music Notation and Engraving \u2013 Braces and Bracket], [[Colorado College]] Music Department</ref> Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an '''accolade''' in some old texts) varies in design and style.\n|}\n\n== Clefs ==\n{{main|Clef}}\nClefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''<br />The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996>{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=0-88284-768-6}}</ref> The treble clef is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. \n|-\n| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''<br />These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the \"alto clef\". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a \"movable\" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a \"tenor clef\". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.<br /> Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''<br />The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996 /> Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a \"bass clef\". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here. In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Neutral clef'''<br />Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.\n|-\n| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Octave clef'''<br />Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.\n|-\n| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]\n|'''Tablature'''<br />For stringed instruments, such as the guitar, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.\n|}\n\n== Notes and rests ==\n\n{{main|Note value}}\n[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values.

In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text \u2013 [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer about the lyrics. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Dotted note]]'''<br />Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' \u00d7 (2 \u2212 2<sup>''\u2212n''</sup>)}}.\n|-\n| [[File:Ghost note.png]]\n|'''[[Ghost note]]'''<br />A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played. It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval. Composers will primarily use this notation to represent percussive pitches.  This notation is also used in parts where spoken words are used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''<br />Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation.

If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat key signature'''<br />'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature, starting with the leftmost, i.e., B{{music|\u266d}}, and proceeding to the right; for example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B{{music|\u266d}} major/G minor, and all B's and E's are \"flatted\" (US) or \"flattened\" (UK), i.e., lowered to B{{music|\u266d}} and E{{music|\u266d}}.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958.

Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature, also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four sharps are used, the key is E major/C{{music|\u266f}} minor, and the corresponding pitches are raised.\n|}\n\n=== Quarter tones ===\nThere is no universally accepted notation for [[microtonal music]], with varying systems being used depending on the situation. A common notation for [[quarter tone]]s involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demiflat'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demisharp'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)<br />Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.\n|}\n\nA symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.\n\nIn [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.\n\n== Time signatures ==\n{{main|Time signature}}\n[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is \"marked off\" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 simple time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as \"three-four time\" or \"three-quarter time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 compound time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as \"Six-Eight Time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Common time]]'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented \"imperfect\" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|80px]]\n|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''<br />Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters \"'''M.M.'''\", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].\n|}\n\n== Note relationships ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''<br />Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical \u2013 that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''<br />Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.<br />Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.<br />A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''<br />A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tuplet]]'''<br />A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''<br />Several notes sounded simultaneously (\"solid\" or \"block\"), or in succession (\"broken\"). Two-note chords are called a '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]''' or an [[Interval (music)|'''interval''']]; three-note chords built from generic third intervals are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''<br />A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a \"broken chord\" or \"rolled chord\".\n|}\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{main|Dynamics (music)}}\nDynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]\n|'''Pianississimo'''<ref name=ppp group=D>Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra \"iss\" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo'').

For example, \"''pianississimo''\" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) means \"so softly as to be almost inaudible\", and \"''fortississimo''\" ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) means \"extremely loud\".  Dynamics are relative, and the meaning of each level is at the discretion of the performer or, in the case of ensembles, the conductor. However, modern legislation to curb high noise levels in the workplace in an effort to prevent damage to musicians' hearing has posed a challenge to the interpretation of very loud dynamics in some large orchestral works, as noise levels within the orchestra itself can easily exceed safe levels when all instruments are playing at full volume<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html \"No Fortissimo?

Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).\n\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]\n|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''<br />A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (''forte''), then immediately softly (''piano'').\n|}\n\nAnother value that rarely appears is ''[[niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means \"nothing\". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate \"fade out to nothing\".\n\n== Articulation marks ==\n[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccato]]'''<br />This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''<br />Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking\u2019s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''<br />Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tenuto]]'''<br />This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a degree of emphasis, especially when combined with dynamic markings to indicate a change in loudness, or combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').\n|-\n| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Marcato]]'''<br />''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge).

Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''<br />A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires, but is often set as twice the original value of the designated notes.\n|}\n\n== Ornaments ==\nOrnaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]][[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''<br />A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a \"shake\". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill. In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn. In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29</ref> In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a [[tremolo]].

In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a \"shake\" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In much music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[File:Music-turn-2.svg|60px]][[File:Music-turn (inverted).png|60px]][[File:Music-inverted turn.png|60px]]}}\n|'''[[Turn (music)|Turn]]'''<br />When placed directly above the note, the turn (also known as a ''gruppetto'') indicates a sequence of upper auxiliary note, principal note, lower auxiliary note, and a return to the principal note. When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''<br />The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''<br />The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged. Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).\n|}\n\n== Octave signs ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Ottava'''<br />''8<sup>va</sup>'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') is placed {{em|above}} the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to play the passage one [[octave]] higher.<br />When this sign (or in recent notation practice, an ''8<sup>vb</sup>'' \u2013 both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed {{em|below}} the staff, it indicates to play the passage one octave lower.<ref>George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W. W. Norton & Company), p. 16</ref><ref>Anthony Donato, ''Preparing Music Manuscript'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.), pp. 42-43</ref>\n|-\n|[[File:Music-quindicesimaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Quindicesima'''<br />The ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' sign is placed ''above'' the staff (as shown) to mean ''play the passage two octaves higher''. A ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' sign ''below'' the staff indicates ''play the passage two octaves lower''.\n|}\n''8<sup>va</sup>'' and ''15<sup>ma</sup>'' are sometimes abbreviated further to ''8'' and ''15''. When they appear below the staff, the word ''bassa'' is sometimes added.\n\n== Repetition and codas ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tremolo.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music Tremolo shortcut.jpg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tremolo]]'''<br />A rapidly repeated note. If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as \"as fast as possible\", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.<br />In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussion and some untuned percussion instruments such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.<br />The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''<br />Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once. If there is no left repeat sign, the right repeat sign sends the performer back to the start of the piece or the nearest double bar.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-simile.svg|100px]]\n|'''Simile marks'''<br />Denote that preceding groups of beats or measures are to be repeated. In the examples here, the first usually means to repeat the previous measure, and the second usually means to repeat the previous two measures.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-volte.svg|100px]]\n|'''Volta brackets''' ('''1st and 2nd endings''', or '''1st- and 2nd-time bars''')<br />A repeated passage is to be played with different endings on different playings; it is possible to have more than two endings (1st, 2nd, 3rd ...).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dacapo.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Da capo]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From top\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music from its beginning. This is usually followed by ''al fine'' (lit. \"to the end\"), which means to repeat to the word ''fine'' and stop, or ''al coda'' (lit. \"to the coda (sign)\"), which means repeat to the coda sign and then jump forward.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dalsegno.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Dal segno]]'''<br /> (lit. \"From the sign\") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music starting at the nearest ''segno''. This is followed by ''al fine'' or ''al coda'' just as with ''da capo''.\n|-\n| [[File:SegnoTeken.svg|50px]]\n|'''Segno'''<br />Mark used with ''dal segno''.\n|-\n| [[File:Coda sign.svg|50px]]\n|'''[[Coda (music)|Coda]]'''<br />Indicates a forward jump in the music to its ending passage, marked with the same sign. Only used after playing through a ''D.S. al coda'' (Dal segno al coda) or ''D.C. al coda'' (Da capo al coda).\n|}\n\n== Instrument-specific notation ==\n=== Bowed string instruments ===\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bart\u00f3k pizzicato|Left-hand pizzicato]]''' or '''[[Stopped note]]'''<br />A note on a stringed instrument where the string is plucked with the left hand (the hand that usually stops the strings) rather than bowed. On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a \"stopped note\" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn). In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be \"choked\" (muted with the hand).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''Snap pizzicato'''<br />On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it \"snap\" against the frame. Also known as a [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] pizzicato.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-harmonic.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|Natural harmonic]]''' or '''Open note'''<br />On a stringed instrument, means to play a natural harmonic (also called '''flageolet'''). On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note \"open\" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''<br />On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Down bow''' or '''Gi\u00f9 arco'''<br />Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with a downstroke.\n|}\n\n=== Guitar ===\n\nThe guitar has a [[fingerpicking]] notation system derived from the names of the fingers in Spanish or Latin. They are written above, below, or beside the note to which they are attached. They read as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Symbol !! Spanish !! Italian !! Latin !! English !!

It features the [[Hong Kong]] celebrity, [[Jackie Chan]], who was also the producer of it, while it also features other actors from some of his films.\n\nDuring the same year, the game was later updated and retitled as {{nihongo|'''''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu'''''|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3 FISTS OF FIRE \u6210\u9f8d\u4f1d\u8aac|lit. \"Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Legend of Jackie Chan\"}}.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe controls of the game are similar to that of SNK's earlier installments in their ''[[Fatal Fury (series)|Fatal Fury]]'' series (particularly ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'', ''[[Fatal Fury Special|Special]]'' and ''[[Fatal Fury 3|3]]''), as well as ''[[The King of Fighters (series)|The King of Fighters]]'' franchise. The special actions are also similar to other fighting games from the same era. The presentation and death moves were most likely influenced by that of the success of [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' franchise, though not the first in the genre.\n\nThe player's character fights against his or her opponent in a standard one-on-one best two-of-three format like most fighting games, but a match can last up to five rounds if there is no clear-cut winner in previous rounds (the game will end if both fighters lose the fifth round and no bonus points will be awarded if one wins the fifth round). Players have a character roster of six characters to choose from at the start, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. In one-player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. After two opponents are knocked out, one out of three versions of Jackie Chan becomes the next opponent. Unlike the ''Mortal Kombat'' series, some powerful finishing moves lack blood and gore, and some do not destroy the opponents. The fast-paced action and zooming view are similar to that of numerous [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] fighting games.\n\n===''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu''===\n''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu''  is an updated version of ''The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan'' that was also released the same year exclusively for the arcades, and was the very last fighting game Kaneko released before their bankruptcy in 2006. It adds a desperation move system, an improved combo system with a special combo counter above the life bars that records the highest number of combos during a match, and an \"escaping\" feature where players can struggle out of combos or stand up as fast as possible by rapidly moving the control stick and tapping the buttons simultaneously. ''Fists of Fire'' also makes all three versions of Jackie Chan into playable characters expanding the roster up to nine playable characters, and makes adjustments to the character balance by strengthening and weakening the statistics of certain playable characters from the first game, while adding and removing a few moves to some of them. The palettes of Lau, Yeung and Thorston were heavily modified as well. The opening intro is a modified version of the first game's intro, but the rest of the game's graphics are not that different.\n\n==Characters==\nThere are six playable characters to choose from in ''The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan'', and nine in ''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Lau'''|\u30ed\u30a6}} (actor: [[Andy Lau|Lau Tak / Andy Lau]]) - Known for his appearances in several Jackie Chan films such as ''[[Island of Fire]]'' as Lau / Boss Lee, and ''[[Drunken Master II]]'' as the Counter Intelligence Officer. In this game, he uses [[karate]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Dark Lau.\n*{{nihongo|'''Yeung'''|\u30e4\u30f3}} (actor: Yeung Ching-Ching) - Known for her appearance in many Shaw Brothers movies including ''[[Clan of the White Lotus]]'' (as herself), ''[[The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter]]'' (as Yang No. 9) and ''[[Treasure Hunters (1981 film)|Treasure Hunters]]'' (as Jue Gow). In this game, she uses [[b\u014djutsu]]. She was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Shadow Yeung.\n*{{nihongo|'''Sam'''|\u30b5\u30e0}} (actor: [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team#Members (past & present)|Sam Wong / Ming-Sing Wong]]) - Known for being one of the former leaders of the well-known [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]]. In this game, he uses [[Chinese martial arts|kung-fu]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Black Sam.\n*{{nihongo|'''Thorsten'''|\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3}} (actor: Thorston Nickel) - Known for his appearance in ''[[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (as Cougar). In this game, he uses traditional [[martial arts]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Demon Thorsten.\n*{{nihongo|'''Kim-Maree'''|\u30ad\u30e0 \u30de\u30ea\u30fc}} (actor: Kim-Maree Penn) - Known for her appearance in ''[[Police Story 3: Supercop]]'' as Blonde Gunwoman (uncredited). In this game, she uses [[professional wrestling]]. She was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Dirty Maree.\n*{{nihongo|'''Mysterious Lion'''|\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u3000\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3}} (actor: Sam Wong / Ming-Sing Wong) - The only original character in the game. In this game, he uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Evil Lion.\n\n===Bosses===\nAfter two opponents have been knocked out, players face Jackie Chan as he uses three different fighting styles in order of appearance. He is unplayable in the original version, but playable in the ''Fists of Fire'' update. Known to be very protective of his image, the three variations of Chan cannot be defeated with a finishing move and give the player a thumbs up if he loses a round.\n*{{nihongo|'''[[Five Animals|Five Animal Fist]]'''|\u4e94\u5f62\u62f3}} (Yellow) - This version of him appears as the first boss.

As the film crew traveled to Japan they began a search for sponsors to fund the film, and as they were searching, the video game developer Kaneko was found.  While Kaneko agreed to sponsor the film, they penned a mutual deal to create a Jackie Chan-based fighting game. The deal was negotiated by Chan's longtime friend and accomplice Frankie Chan, who also co-produced the game. Due to the timing and relationship between filming ''Thunderbolt'' in Japan and signing the fighting game deal, Kaneko brought Jackie Chan and some of his actors and stuntmen of ''Thunderbolt'' such as Sam Wong and Thorsten Nickel to the offices in Tokyo in order to start the motion capture work in order to convert them into playable characters.

It features the [[Hong Kong]] celebrity, [[Jackie Chan]], who was also the producer of it, while it also features other actors from some of his films.\n\nDuring the same year, the game was later updated and retitled as {{nihongo|'''''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu'''''|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3 FISTS OF FIRE \u6210\u9f8d\u4f1d\u8aac|lit. \"Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Legend of Jackie Chan\"}}.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe controls of the game are similar to that of SNK's earlier installments in their ''[[Fatal Fury (series)|Fatal Fury]]'' series (particularly ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'', ''[[Fatal Fury Special|Special]]'' and ''[[Fatal Fury 3|3]]''), as well as ''[[The King of Fighters (series)|The King of Fighters]]'' franchise. The special actions are also similar to other fighting games from the same era. The presentation and death moves were most likely influenced by that of the success of [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' franchise, though not the first in the genre.\n\nThe player's character fights against his or her opponent in a standard one-on-one best two-of-three format like most fighting games, but a match can last up to five rounds if there is no clear-cut winner in previous rounds (the game will end if both fighters lose the fifth round and no bonus points will be awarded if one wins the fifth round). Players has a character roster of six characters to choose from at the start, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. In one-player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. After two opponents are knocked out, one out of three versions of Jackie Chan becomes the next opponent. Unlike the ''Mortal Kombat'' series, some powerful finishing moves lack blood and gore, and some don't destroy the opponents. The fast-paced action and zooming view are similar to that of numerous [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] fighting games.\n\n===''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu''===\n''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire: Jackie Chan Densetsu''  is an updated version of ''The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan'' that was also released the same year exclusively for the arcades, and was the very last fighting game Kaneko released before their bankruptcy in 2006. It adds a desperation move system, an improved combo system with a special combo counter above the life bars that records the highest number of combos during a match, and an \"escaping\" feature where players can struggle out of combos or stand up as fast as possible by rapidly moving the control stick and tapping the buttons simultaneously. ''Fists of Fire'' also makes all three versions of Jackie Chan into playable characters expanding the roster up to nine playable characters, and makes adjustments to the character balance by strengthening and weakening the statistics of certain playable characters from the first game, while adding and removing a few moves to some of them. The palettes of Lau, Yeung and Thorston were heavily modified as well. The opening intro is a modified version of the first game's intro, but the rest of the game's graphics are not that different.\n\n==Characters==\nThere are six playable characters to choose from in ''The Kung-Fu Master Jackie Chan'', and nine in ''Jackie Chan in Fists of Fire''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Lau'''|\u30ed\u30a6}} (actor: [[Andy Lau|Lau Tak / Andy Lau]]) - Known for his appearances in several Jackie Chan films such as ''[[Island of Fire]]'' as Lau / Boss Lee, and ''[[Drunken Master II]]'' as the Counter Intelligence Officer. In this game, he uses [[karate]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Dark Lau.\n*{{nihongo|'''Yeung'''|\u30e4\u30f3}} (actor: Yeung Ching-Ching) - Known for her appearance in many Shaw Brothers movies including ''[[Clan of the White Lotus]]'' (as herself), ''[[The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter]]'' (as Yang No. 9) and ''[[Treasure Hunters (1981 film)|Treasure Hunters]]'' (as Jue Gow). In this game, she uses [[b\u014djutsu]]. She was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Shadow Yeung.\n*{{nihongo|'''Sam'''|\u30b5\u30e0}} (actor: [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team#Members (past & present)|Sam Wong / Ming-Sing Wong]]) - Known for being one of the former leaders of the well-known [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]]. In this game, he uses [[Chinese martial arts|kung-fu]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Black Sam.\n*{{nihongo|'''Thorsten'''|\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3}} (actor: Thorston Nickel) - Known for his appearance in ''[[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (as Cougar). In this game, he uses traditional [[martial arts]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Demon Thorsten.\n*{{nihongo|'''Kim-Maree'''|\u30ad\u30e0 \u30de\u30ea\u30fc}} (actor: Kim-Maree Penn) - Known for her appearance in ''[[Police Story 3: Supercop]]'' as Blonde Gunwoman (uncredited). In this game, she uses [[professional wrestling]]. She was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Dirty Maree.\n*{{nihongo|'''Mysterious Lion'''|\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u3000\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3}} (actor: Sam Wong / Ming-Sing Wong) - The only original character in the game. In this game, he uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. He was later altered in the ''Fists of Fire'' update as Evil Lion.\n\n===Bosses===\nAfter two opponents have been knocked out, players face Jackie Chan as he uses three different fighting styles in order of appearance. He is unplayable in the original version, but playable in the ''Fists of Fire'' update. Known to be very protective of his image, the three variations of Chan cannot be defeated with a finishing move and give the player a thumbs up if he loses a round.\n*{{nihongo|'''[[Five Animals|Five Animal Fist]]'''|\u4e94\u5f62\u62f3}} (Yellow) - This version of him appears as the first boss.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is.

He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

New York Times ] October 29, 1966: 1.</ref>)\n\nHamilton then made a science fiction movie for [[George Pal]] at MGM, ''[[The Power (1968 film)|The Power]]'' (1968).\n\n===Television===\nGeorge went into television in 1969, supporting [[Lana Turner]] in the all-star ABC series ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]'' (1969\u201370).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-survivors/cast/204719/|title=The Survivors (1969) Cast| website=TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the show was canceled in January 1970, George went into ''[[Paris 7000]]'' (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena\u2014including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]]. As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: \"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or\u2014this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms\u2014with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution\".<ref>''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.</ref> These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society which are, in turn, fought out at the level of the [[class struggle]].<ref name=\"ComparingEconomic\">''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a socialist society, [[private property]]\u2014in the form of the means of production\u2014would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs\u2014that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".<ref>''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.</ref>\n\n[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.<ref>Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \"Men make their own history\".

All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].\n\nThe base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: \"The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society\" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political \"forms of social consciousness\" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.<ref>See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R.

As Engels clarified: \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes\".<ref>''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.</ref>\n\nMarx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:<ref>Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not \"an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself\".

Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes. In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term \"surplus labour\", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker. In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the \"voluntary\" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.<!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. -->\n\n[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (German: ''[[Gattungswesen]]'', \"species-essence\", \"species-being\"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.<ref>\"Alienation\" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''</ref> In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism\u2014his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.\n\n=== Social classes ===\n{{main|Marxian class theory}}\n{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}\nMarx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:\n* [[Proletariat]]: \"[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref> The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].\n* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who \"own the means of production\" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.\n** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.\n* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economic affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.\n* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.\n* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.\n\n[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness\u2014of itself and the social world\u2014that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nWithout defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],<ref>Joseph McCarney (April 2005).

Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and (by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace) create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.\n\nMarx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest amount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.\n\nThrough [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is the property of the society as a whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators.

The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Gr\u00fcnberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]].

Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.\n\n[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.<ref>Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought.

Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]].\n\n[[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W.

He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\".<ref>''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.</ref>\n\nFriedrich Engels (28 November 1820 \u2013 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.\n\nIn 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.\n\nAfter Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings.

The Bolsheviks established the first [[socialist state]] based on the ideas of [[Soviet Democracy]] and [[Leninism]]. Their newly formed federal state promised to end Russian involvement in [[World War I]] and establish a revolutionary worker's state. Following the October Revolution the Soviet government was involved in a struggle with the [[White Movement]] and several independence movements in the [[Russian Civil War]]. This period is marked by the establishment of many socialist policies and the development of new socialist ideas mainly in the form of [[Marxism-Leninism]]. In 1919 the nascent Soviet Government established the [[Communist Academy]] and the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute]] for doctrinal Marxist study as well as to publish official ideological and research documents for the [[CPSU]]. With Lenin's death in 1924 there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] in the form of the [[Right Opposition]] and [[Left Opposition]] respectively. These struggles were based on both sides different interpretations of Marxist and Leninist theory based on the situation of the [[Soviet Union]] at the time.<ref>History.com Staff. \"Russian Revolution.\" History.com, A&E Television Networks, 2009, www.history.com/topics/russian-revolution.</ref><ref>Sean McMeekin, The Russian Revolution: A New History (Basic Books: May 2017)</ref>\n\n===Chinese Revolution===\n{{main|Chinese Communist Revolution|Maoism|Socialism with Chinese Characteristics|Anti-Revisionism}}\n{{quote box|quote=The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable.

The [[Chinese Communist Party]], which was founded in 1921, was in conflict with the [[Kuomintang]] over the future of the country. Throughout the Civil War [[Mao Zedong]] developed a theory of Marxism for the Chinese historical context. Mao found a large base of support in the peasantry as opposed to the Russian Revolution which found its primary support in the urban centers of the Russian Empire. Some major ideas contributed by Mao were the ideas of [[New Democracy]], [[Mass line]], and [[People's War]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was declared in 1949. The new socialist state was to be founded on the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.<ref>\nFranke, Wolfgang, A Century of Chinese Revolution, 1851\u20131949 (Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1970).</ref><ref>Ellison, Herbert J., ed.

[[De-Stalinization]], which first began under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and the policy of [[detente]] were seen as [[Revisionism (Marxism)]] and insufficiently Marxist.

This new model was to be a newer dynamic form of Marxism-Leninism and Maoism in the PRC. Commonly referred to as [[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]] this new path was centered around Deng's [[Four Cardinal Principles]] which sought to uphold the central role of the Chinese Communist Party and uphold the principle that the PRC was in the [[Primary stage of socialism]] and that it was still working to build a communist society based on Marxist principles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schram |first1=Stuart |authorlink= |year=1989 |title = The Thought of Mao Tse-Tung |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn = 9780521310628 |ref = CITEREFSchram1989 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/dengxp/vol2/text/b1290.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827102126/http://en.people.cn/dengxp/vol2/text/b1290.html |archive-date=27 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Late 20th century ===\n[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]\nIn 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.<ref>See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].</ref> One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928\u20131967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to purge Chinese society of capitalist elements and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978\u20131992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics\u2014championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]\u2014led the west to take a more aggressive stand towards the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist\u2013Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/12/resources/5037?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&pid=mssa:ms.0650&query=&clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&hlon=yes&big=&adv=&filter=&hitPageStart=&sortFields=&view=all|title=Collection: Cuban revolution collection &#124; Archives at Yale|website=Archives.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>Carrere D'Encausse, Helene (1993).

These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.<ref>M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929\u20131990''.

For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: \"Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&nbsp;...

Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence\u2013\u2013but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx\u2019s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?\" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's \"Capital\": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx\u2019s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] (\"The Return of Karl Marx,\" ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 & 27, 1997, p. 252): \"His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days.\"</ref>\n\n=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===\nMarx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.<ref>Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's \"Capital\"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=Stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory.

However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).\n\nLibertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]<ref>[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.</ref> and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',<ref>Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.</ref> emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.<ref>Draper, Hal.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena\u2014including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]]. As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: \"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or\u2014this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms\u2014with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution\".<ref>''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.</ref> These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society which are, in turn, fought out at the level of the [[class struggle]].<ref name=\"ComparingEconomic\">''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a socialist society, [[private property]]\u2014in the form of the means of production\u2014would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs\u2014that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".<ref>''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.</ref>\n\n[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.<ref>Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \"Men make their own history\".

All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].\n\nThe base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: \"The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society\" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political \"forms of social consciousness\" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.<ref>See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-D\u00fchring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]</ref> This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes\".<ref>''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.</ref>\n\nMarx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:<ref>Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not \"an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself\". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.</ref>\n# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.\n# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.\n# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.\n# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.\n\n=== Criticism of capitalism ===\n{{further|Opposition to capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}\nAccording to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], \"the principal content of Marxism\" was \"Marx's economic doctrine\".<ref>[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.</ref> Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that \"the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&nbsp;... one and the same\", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that \"the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]\" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.<ref>[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].</ref>\n\nExploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]\u2014the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes. In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term \"surplus labour\", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker. In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the \"voluntary\" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.<!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. -->\n\n[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (German: ''[[Gattungswesen]]'', \"species-essence\", \"species-being\"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.<ref>\"Alienation\" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''</ref> In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism\u2014his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.\n\n=== Social classes ===\n{{main|Marxian class theory}}\n{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}\nMarx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:\n* [[Proletariat]]: \"[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref> The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].\n* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who \"own the means of production\" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.\n** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.\n* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economic affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.\n* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.\n* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.\n\n[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness\u2014of itself and the social world\u2014that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nWithout defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],<ref>Joseph McCarney (April 2005).

Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and (by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace) create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.\n\nMarx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest amount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.\n\nThrough [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is the property of the society as a whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, [[Withering away of the state|will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared]].<ref name=\"Origins of the Family- Chapter IX\">{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ZhaoDickson2001\">{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: \"The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&nbsp;...

As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Gr\u00fcnberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).\n\n[[Marxian economics]] is a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}</ref> Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.\n\n[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.<ref>Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>\n\n[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]].\n\n[[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Luk\u00e1cs]], [[Ernst Fischer (writer)|Ernst Fischer]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].\n\nAccording to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===\n{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}\n[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]\nKarl Marx (5 May 1818 \u2013 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\".<ref>''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.</ref>\n\nFriedrich Engels (28 November 1820 \u2013 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.\n\nIn 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.\n\nAfter Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&nbsp;\u2013 analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class\u2014Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].\n\n===Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union===\n{{main|October Revolution|CPSU|Leninism|Marxism-Leninism|Trotskyism}}\n[[File:Lenin and stalin.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]]]]\nWith the [[October Revolution]] in 1917 the [[Bolsheviks]] took power from the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. The Bolsheviks established the first [[socialist state]] based on the ideas of [[Soviet Democracy]] and [[Leninism]]. Their newly formed federal state promised to end Russian involvement in [[World War I]] and establish a revolutionary worker's state. Following the October Revolution the Soviet government was involved in a struggle with the [[White Movement]] and several independence movements in the [[Russian Civil War]]. This period is marked by the establishment of many socialist policies and the development of new socialist ideas mainly in the form of [[Marxism-Leninism]]. In 1919 the nascent Soviet Government established the [[Communist Academy]] and the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute]] for doctrinal Marxist study as well as to publish official ideological and research documents for the [[CPSU]]. With Lenin's death in 1924 there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] in the form of the [[Right Opposition]] and [[Left Opposition]] respectively.

Throughout the Civil War [[Mao Zedong]] developed a theory of Marxism for the Chinese historical context. Mao found a large base of support in the peasantry as opposed to the Russian Revolution which found its primary support in the urban centers of the Russian Empire. Some major ideas contributed by Mao were the ideas of [[New Democracy]], [[Mass line]], and [[People's War]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was declared in 1949.

He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to purge Chinese society of capitalist elements and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978\u20131992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology.

Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist\u2013Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/12/resources/5037?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&pid=mssa:ms.0650&query=&clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&hlon=yes&big=&adv=&filter=&hitPageStart=&sortFields=&view=all|title=Collection: Cuban revolution collection &#124; Archives at Yale|website=Archives.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>Carrere D'Encausse, Helene (1993).

These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.<ref>M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929\u20131990''.

Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton & Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}</ref>\n\nSome Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: \"Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars\".<ref>[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.<ref>For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}</ref> Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]\u2014the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.<ref>Held, David (1980), p. 16.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11\u201330|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}</ref>\n\n=== General criticisms ===\nPhilosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] pointed out that \"Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles\". Specifically, he considers \"the laws of dialectics\" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are \"truisms with no specific Marxist content\", others \"philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means\" and some just \"nonsense\". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.<ref>{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.

C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929\u20131990, chapter 7, sects. II\u2013IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.</ref>\n\nThe allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.<ref>See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929\u20131990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.</ref> [[Andrew Kliman]] argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.<ref name=\":0\">Kliman states that \"Marx\u2019s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence\u2013\u2013but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx\u2019s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?\" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's \"Capital\": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx\u2019s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] (\"The Return of Karl Marx,\" ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 & 27, 1997, p. 252): \"His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days.\"</ref>\n\n=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===\nMarx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.<ref>Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's \"Capital\"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=Stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialist critiques ===\n[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations\u2014rooted in Marxism's \"scientific\" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors\u2014has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.\n\nAfter Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself\u2014a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.\n\n=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===\n{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}\n[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.<ref name=Bakunin1872>{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Libert\u00e9'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm|website=Marxists.org}}</ref> The phrases \"barracks socialism\" or \"[[barracks communism]]\" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].<ref name=\"Sperber_2013\">{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W.

Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism \"Marxism in practice\", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).\n\nLibertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]<ref>[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.</ref> and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',<ref>Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.</ref> emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.<ref>Draper, Hal.

In Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.</ref> and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.<ref>M. C. Howard and J. E. King.

The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that B\u00f6hm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.<ref>[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M.

He is remembered as the first person to suggest that the United States should issue paper currency (\"[[greenback (money)|greenback]]s\") during the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born Edmund Richard Taylor in [[Lunenburg County, Virginia]], son of Giles Y Taylor (1766\u20131830) and Francine \"Sina\" Stokes. In later years, he preferred to use his middle name rather than his first name, and used in its short form. Thus he became known as \"Dick\" Taylor, and his middle initial was written \"D\" in formal documents.\n\nIn the fall of 1823, he began general merchandising with Colonel John Taylor in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. On 18 September 1829, he married Margaret Taylor (born 28 December 1813 in Kentucky), the daughter of Col. John Taylor and Elizabeth (Burkhead) Taylor.<ref name=Settlers>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lkgWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA707 ''History of the early settlers of Sangamon County, Illinois'' p. 707.

In 1832 he was re-elected, defeating several challengers including [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Taylor was the only man to defeat Lincoln in a direct election.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lkgWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA707 John Carroll Power and Sarah A.

After holding this position for four years, he returned to the private sector. He continued to play a leading role in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics in Illinois.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalencyc01bate#page/518/mode/2up Newton Bateman, Paul Selby, Alexander McLean (1907) ''Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois'', Volume 1, pp. 519-520.]</ref>\n\n==Business career==\n\n===Illinois coal mines===\nTaylor was a pioneer of the coal industry in Illinois. In 1823 he took an interest in coal and opened the West End Shaft, also known as West End Coal Mine.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o0Y0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA967  Urias John Hoffman (1906) ''History of La Salle County, Illinois'' p. 967]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsangamo00inte#page/522/mode/2up ''History of Sangamon County, Illinois''.

Bailhache & Baker, 1863.]</ref>\n\n===Internal improvements===\nTaylor played an important role in Illinois in promoting and bringing about\n\"[[internal improvements]]\" (canals, railroads, and other transportation infrastructure). General Usher F. Linder stated \"If any man deserves more credit than another for the completion of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], it is Col. Edmund D. Taylor.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dw49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60 Usher F.

Brown was called to the chair and William Stuart appointed Secretary, Francis Payton stated the objects of the meeting. A committee of five was appointed namely: Edmund D. Taylor, Captain J. B. F. Russell, Francis Payton, [[John H. Kinzie]], and Joseph N. Balestier. The meeting declared in favor of the immediate construction of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] and general system of improvement.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lOg6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA83 D. K.

He had insurance, but it was with Chicago firms that were overwhelmed by the disaster.\n\n===Appeal to Congress===\nDuring the Civil War, Taylor had spent considerable sums from his own pocket for travel on government business and in raising and equipping Union troops. At the time, he asked for no reimbursement. But in 1887, he applied to Congress to be repaid $15,000 of his expenses. Taylor retained considerable standing in Chicago's business community. His petition included a supporting memorial signed by 56 prominent men of Chicago and Illinois. Taylor's petition was considered by the Committee on War Claims, but it was rejected for want of documentation.<ref name=\"Rep380\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=x5wZAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA123 Report No. 380 to the 50th Congress.

May 27, 1890]</ref>\n\n==Father of the Greenback==\n\nBy late 1861, it was clear that the Civil War was going to be much more costly than anyone had expected, and that the Union would have to raise or find or borrow vast amounts of money. Taylor had the idea that the Union could pay its expenses with newly created money in the form of paper currency (\"[[greenback (money)|greenback]]s\"). In 1861, Taylor mentioned his idea for greenbacks at [[Ulysses S. Grant|General Grant]]'s headquarters in [[Cairo, Illinois]].\n\nOn 16 January 1862, Taylor met privately with President [[Abraham Lincoln]] at his request. Taylor suggested the issuance of treasury notes bearing no interest and printed on the best banking paper. Taylor said \"Just get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes... and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also. If you make them full legal tender... they will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as any money; as Congress is given the express right by the Constitution.\"<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web |url=http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/lincoln_obama.php |title=Revive Lincoln's Monetary Policy|last1=Brown |first1=Ellen|date=April 8, 2009 |website=webofdebt.com|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter dated 16 December 1864, the President named Col.

He is remembered as the first person to suggest that the United States should issue paper currency (\"[[greenback (money)|greenback]]s\") during the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born Edmund Richard Taylor in [[Lunenburg County, Virginia]], son of Giles Y Taylor (1766\u20131830) and Francine \"Sina\" Stokes. In later years, he preferred to use his middle name rather than his first name, and used in its short form. Thus he became known as \"Dick\" Taylor, and his middle initial was written \"D\" in formal documents.\n\nIn the fall of 1823, he began general merchandising with Colonel John Taylor in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. On 18 September 1829, he married Margaret Taylor (born 28 December 1813 in Kentucky), the daughter of Col. John Taylor and Elizabeth (Burkhead) Taylor.<ref name=Settlers>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lkgWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA707 ''History of the early settlers of Sangamon County, Illinois'' p. 707.

In 1832 he was re-elected, defeating several challengers including [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Taylor was the only man to defeat Lincoln in a direct election.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lkgWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA707 John Carroll Power and Sarah A.

After holding this position for four years, he returned to the private sector. He continued to play a leading role in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics in Illinois.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalencyc01bate#page/518/mode/2up Newton Bateman, Paul Selby, Alexander McLean (1907) ''Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois'', Volume 1, pp. 519-520.]</ref>\n\n==Business career==\n\n===Illinois coal mines===\nTaylor was a pioneer of the coal industry in Illinois. In 1823 he took an interest in coal and opened the West End Shaft, also known as West End Coal Mine.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o0Y0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA967  Urias John Hoffman (1906) ''History of La Salle County, Illinois'' p. 967]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsangamo00inte#page/522/mode/2up ''History of Sangamon County, Illinois''.

Bailhache & Baker, 1863.]</ref>\n\n===Internal improvements===\nTaylor played an important role in Illinois in promoting and bringing about\n\"[[internal improvements]]\" (canals, railroads, and other transportation infrastructure). General Usher F. Linder stated \"If any man deserves more credit than another for the completion of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], it is Col. Edmund D. Taylor.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dw49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60 Usher F.

Brown was called to the chair and William Stuart appointed Secretary, Francis Payton stated the objects of the meeting. A committee of five was appointed namely: Edmund D. Taylor, Captain J. B. F. Russell, Francis Payton, [[John H. Kinzie]], and Joseph N. Balestier. The meeting declared in favor of the immediate construction of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] and general system of improvement.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lOg6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA83 D. K.

He had insurance, but it was with Chicago firms that were overwhelmed by the disaster.\n\n===Appeal to Congress===\nDuring the Civil War, Taylor had spent considerable sums from his own pocket for travel on government business and in raising and equipping Union troops. At the time, he asked for no reimbursement. But in 1887, he applied to Congress to be repaid $15,000 of his expenses. Taylor retained considerable standing in Chicago's business community. His petition included a supporting memorial signed by 56 prominent men of Chicago and Illinois. Taylor's petition was considered by the Committee on War Claims, but it was rejected for want of documentation.<ref name=\"Rep380\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=x5wZAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA123 Report No. 380 to the 50th Congress.

May 27, 1890]</ref>\n\n==Father of the Greenback==\n\nBy late 1861, it was clear that the Civil War was going to be much more costly than anyone had expected, and that the Union would have to raise or find or borrow vast amounts of money. Taylor had the idea that the Union could pay its expenses with newly created money in the form of paper currency (\"[[greenback (money)|greenback]]s\"). In 1861, Taylor mentioned his idea for greenbacks at [[Ulysses S. Grant|General Grant]]'s headquarters in [[Cairo, Illinois]].\n\nOn 16 January 1862, Taylor met privately with President [[Abraham Lincoln]] at his request. Taylor suggested the issuance of treasury notes bearing no interest and printed on the best banking paper. Taylor said \"Just get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes... and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also. If you make them full legal tender... they will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as any money; as Congress is given the express right by the Constitution.\"<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web |url=http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/lincoln_obama.php |title=Revive Lincoln's Monetary Policy|last1=Brown |first1=Ellen|date=April 8, 2009 |website=webofdebt.com|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter dated 16 December 1864, the President named Col.

He included the 1864 letter from Lincoln.<ref name=\"Rep380\"/> In February 1888, he added a recent letter from General [[John Alexander McClernand|John McClernand]], who had been at Cairo at the time, and confirmed Taylor's account.<ref name=\"Rep380\"/>\n\n==Educational institutions==\nTaylor was a patron of many educational institutions.\n\nIn 1837, he was on the Board of Trustees for [[Rush Medical College]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJBBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA12 ''Fergus' Historical Series''', Issues 27-30, p. 12., H.
