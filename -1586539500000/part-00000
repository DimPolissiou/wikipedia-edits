It also provides facilities for performances, gatherings, talks, entertainment and small conferences.

Host [[Sandi Richard]] comes \"to the rescue\" of a family that can't cope with making healthy, fresh dinners, and teaches how to counteract their lack of time.\n\nThe show follows a standard format - first, a 'help us' video is shown, detailing the problems the family faces. Sandi comes to their house to discuss the situation in more detail, and to inspect the kitchen. She identifies the most stressful or time crunched day of the week, labeled 'Fright Night'.\n\nShe returns several days later with a menu plan of a month's worth of meals. Magnets symbolizing the various family members and the foods they will cook are placed on the fridge as she introduces this week's menu.\n\nA shopping trip follows, with Sandi recommending various prepared or partially prepared foods as time savers (such as store-bought sauces, precut vegetables).

Host [[Sandi Richard]] comes \"to the rescue\" of a family that can't cope with making healthy, fresh dinners, and teaches how to counteract their lack of time.\n\nThe show follows a standard format - first, a 'help us' video is shown, detailing the problems the family faces. Sandi comes to their house to discuss the situation in more detail, and to inspect the kitchen. She identifies the most stressful or time crunched day of the week, labeled 'Fright Night'.\n\nShe returns several days later with a menu plan of a month's worth of meals. Magnets symbolizing the various family members and the foods they will cook are placed on the fridge as she introduces this week's menu.\n\nA shopping trip follows, with Sandi recommending various prepared or partially prepared foods as time savers (such as store-bought sauces, precut vegetables). In some episodes, a brief overview of how Sandi has reorganized the kitchen is shown.\n\nThen Sandi proceeds to walk each family member through the meals they are preparing this week. The family is left alone to handle 'Fright Night' according to her plans.\n\nTo conclude the show, Sandi returns a month later to find out how the monthly meal plan has worked.

Henry bombardement 1814.jpg|thumb|Bomb vessels attacking [[Fort McHenry]] during the [[Battle of Baltimore]]]]\nA '''bomb vessel''', '''bomb ship''', '''bomb ketch''', or simply '''bomb''' was a type of wooden sailing [[naval ship]].

Bomb vessels were specialized ships designed for bombarding (hence the name) fixed positions on land.

The side-by-side, forward-pointing mortars were replaced in the British designs by mortars mounted on the centerline on revolving platforms. These platforms were supported by strong internal wooden framework to transmit the forces of firing the weapons to the hull. The interstices of the framework were used as storage areas for ammunition.\n\n[[File:Granado bomb vessel model.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Granado'' bomb vessel, launched in 1742. It has two mortars inline. [[National Maritime Museum]], London.]]\nEarly bomb vessels were rigged as [[ketch]]es with two [[mast (sailing)|masts]]. They were [[seamanship|awkward vessels to handle]], in part because bomb ketches typically had the masts stepped farther aft than would have been normal in other vessels of similar rig, in order to accommodate the mortars forward and provide a clear area for their forwards fire. As a result, by the 1800s British bomb vessels were designed as [[full rigged ship]]s with three masts, and two mortars, one between each neighboring pair of masts.<ref name=\"Block2003\">{{cite book|author=Leo Block|title=To harness the wind: a short history of the development of sails|year=2003|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-55750-209-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc/page/65 65]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc/page/65}}</ref> The full rig also meant that bomb vessels could be used as escort sloops between bombardment missions; in 1805 the [[Acheron]] bomb along with the [[Arrow]] sloop were both lost in a valiant defence of their convoy. Bomb vessels often had the front rigging made of chain, to better withstand the muzzle blast of the mortars.<ref name=\"Zorlu2008\"/>\n\nMortars were the only kind of naval armament to fire explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]] rather than solid shot until the invention of the [[Paixhans gun]]. Since it was considered dangerous to have large stocks of shells on board the ships that were firing them, and because the reinforced mortar platforms occupied so much space below decks, bomb vessels were usually accompanied by a tender to carry ammunition as well as the ordnance officers in charge of firing the mortars. However, as naval warfare became more advanced, bomb ships were also accompanied by frigates to protect them from direct assault by faster, smaller vessels.\n\nBomb vessels were traditionally named after [[volcano]]es, or given other names suggestive of explosive qualities. Some were also given names associated with the [[underworld]]. Vessels of other types which were later converted to bomb ships generally retained their original names.\n\nBomb vessels were highly specialized and expensive to fit out and maintain, and only marginally suited for their secondary role as [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]]. Because bomb vessels were built with extremely strong hulls to withstand the recoil of the mortars, several were converted in peacetime as ships for exploration of the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions, where [[pack ice]] and [[icebergs]] were a constant menace. Most famously, these ships included {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}. In this case, the volcanoes \u2013 [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] on [[Ross Island]] in [[Antarctica]] \u2013 were named after the ships, instead of vice versa.\n\n[[File:Fort-Pulaski-Under-Fire-April-1862-Leslie-s-Weekly-Mod.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Fort Pulaski|Fort Pulaski under fire. 1 May 1862.]]]]\nAlthough horizontal fire naval guns propelling explosive shells had entered all major navies by the 1840s (see [[Paixhans gun]]), there was still room for a specialized vessel on occasion. During the American Civil War, the Union fleet included armored gunboats armed with 13 inch mortars; the weapon weighed 17,250&nbsp;lbs and its bedding another 4,500&nbsp;lbs.

The side-by-side, forward-pointing mortars were replaced in the British designs by mortars mounted on the centerline on revolving platforms. These platforms were supported by strong internal wooden framework to transmit the forces of firing the weapons to the hull. The interstices of the framework were used as storage areas for ammunition.\n\n[[File:Granado bomb vessel model.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Granado'' bomb vessel, launched in 1742. It has two mortars inline. [[National Maritime Museum]], London.]]\nEarly bomb vessels were rigged as [[ketch]]es with two [[mast (sailing)|masts]]. They were [[seamanship|awkward vessels to handle]], in part because bomb ketches typically had the masts stepped farther aft than would have been normal in other vessels of similar rig, in order to accommodate the mortars forward and provide a clear area for their forwards fire. As a result, by the 1800s British bomb vessels were designed as [[full rigged ship]]s with three masts, and two mortars, one between each neighboring pair of masts.<ref name=\"Block2003\">{{cite book|author=Leo Block|title=To harness the wind: a short history of the development of sails|year=2003|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-55750-209-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc/page/65 65]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc/page/65}}</ref> The full rig also meant that bomb vessels could be used as escort sloops between bombardment missions; in 1805 the [[Acheron]] bomb along with the [[Arrow]] sloop were both lost in a valiant defence of their convoy. Bomb vessels often had the front rigging made of chain, to better withstand the muzzle blast of the mortars.<ref name=\"Zorlu2008\"/>\n\nMortars were the only kind of naval armament to fire explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]] rather than solid shot until the invention of the [[Paixhans gun]]. Since it was considered dangerous to have large stocks of shells on board the ships that were firing them, and because the reinforced mortar platforms occupied so much space below decks, bomb vessels were usually accompanied by a tender to carry ammunition as well as the ordnance officers in charge of firing the mortars. However, as naval warfare became more advanced, bomb ships were also accompanied by frigates to protect them from direct assault by faster, smaller vessels.\n\nBomb vessels were traditionally named after [[volcano]]es, or given other names suggestive of explosive qualities. Some were also given names associated with the [[underworld]]. Vessels of other types which were later converted to bomb ships generally retained their original names.\n\nBomb vessels were highly specialized and expensive to fit out and maintain, and only marginally suited for their secondary role as [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]]. Because bomb vessels were built with extremely strong hulls to withstand the recoil of the mortars, several were converted in peacetime as ships for exploration of the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions, where [[pack ice]] and [[icebergs]] were a constant menace. Most famously, these ships included {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}. In this case, the volcanoes \u2013 [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] on [[Ross Island]] in [[Antarctica]] \u2013 were named after the ships, instead of vice versa.\n\n[[File:Fort-Pulaski-Under-Fire-April-1862-Leslie-s-Weekly-Mod.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Fort Pulaski|Fort Pulaski under fire. 1 May 1862.]]]]\nAlthough horizontal fire naval guns propelling explosive shells had entered all major navies by the 1840s (see [[Paixhans gun]]), there was still room for a specialized vessel on occasion. During the American Civil War, the Union fleet included armored gunboats armed with 13 inch mortars; the weapon weighed 17,250&nbsp;lbs and its bedding another 4,500&nbsp;lbs. They fired 204-lb shells, with a bursting charge of 7&nbsp;lbs of gunpowder, and had a range of three miles. At this distance, the projectile spent 30 seconds in flight.

Saint Arunagirinadhar had sung Thiruppugazh on this temple. The temple belonging to the 14th century was under dilapidated conditions a few decades back and with the efforts of Sri Swami Balamugan Adimai, the temple is now restored to its full glory with fantastic sculptural works, big mandapams etc., to the extent of people calling this as the 7th Padai Veedu of Lord [[Muruga]].\n\n==Legend==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Tirumarugal3.jpg| Gopuram view\nImage:Tirumarugal2.jpg| [[Pushkarni|Temple Tank]]\nImage:Tirumarugal4.jpg| Inside view\nFile:Tirumarugalratnagirisvarartemple3.jpg|Front Mandapa\nFile:Tirumarugalratnagirisvarartemple4.jpg|Tirumana mandapa\nFile:Tirumarugalratnagirisvarartemple5.jpg|Vimana of presiding deity\nFile:Tirumarugalratnagirisvarartemple6.jpg|Vimana of Goddess\nFile:Tirumarugalratnagirisvarartemple7.jpg|Mandapa in the middle of tank\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n* {{cite book|title=South Indian shrines: illustrated|author=P.

Agencies typically are reviewed every 12 years. During the 2009 legislative session, the session adjourned without the legislature continuing several agencies (among them the [[Texas Department of Transportation]], the state's largest), thus requiring the [[Governor of Texas|governor]] to call a special session.\n\nSunset staff conducts an agency's review in the interim before the session when the agency's enabling act comes under legislative scrutiny. The agency prepares a self-evaluation report for the commission. Sunset staff meets with the agency's leadership and staff as well as interest groups, regulated entities, and members of the public who are affected by the agency. Staff also coordinates with other state oversight agencies, such as the State Auditor's Office and the Legislative Budget Board. After the staff publishes its report with recommendations to the commission, the commission holds a public hearing and takes public comments, then holds a second public meeting to make decisions about which recommendations to adopt, including any new proposals from other sources. The commission can recommend any of the following:\n*Continue the agency as is.\n*Continue the agency with modifications (including moving functions from the agency to other agencies, moving functions from other agencies into it, and most commonly, making improvements to the effectiveness and efficiency of an agency's functions.\n*Merge the agency with another agency.\n*Disband the agency and either transfer its functions to other agencies, or abolish them altogether.\n\nIf the commission recommends continuing the agency, it must provide draft legislation to extend the agency's Sunset date and to make any other recommendations the commission adopted. The legislature must pass a bill in order to continue an agency's existence and has complete freedom to amend or reject the commission's recommendations. Generally, the bill will continue the agency for 12 years (six biennial sessions), but this may be shortened to equalize the number and size of agencies under review each biennium or to allow the commission and the legislature to review the status of significant actions taken regarding the agency. If an agency is abolished, the Sunset Act provides a one-year wind-down period for the agency to conclude its operations.\n\nThe commission also performs limited reviews on agencies not subject to sunset at the discretion of the legislature and can recommend that the agency be abolished. In those cases the legislature must pass a bill to abolish the agency without the incentive of an expiring Sunset date in the agency's enabling act.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\nSunset In Texas [https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/u64/Sunset%20in%20Texas%202017-2019.pdf]\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Texas}}\n*[https://www.sunset.texas.gov/ Official website]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Texas Legislature]]\n[[Category:State agencies of Texas]]\n[[Category:Texas House of Representatives]]\n[[Category:Texas Senate]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2009}}\n{{infobox organization\n|image         = Texas sunset advisory commission logo.png\n|image_border  = \n|size          = \n|caption       = \n|map           = \n|msize         = \n|mcaption      = \n|abbreviation  = \n|motto         = \n|formation     = 1977\n|extinction    = \n|type          = Legislative commission\n|status        = \n|purpose       = Review of [[government agency|state agencies]]\n|headquarters  = 1501 N.

{"title_page": "Historiography of the Crusades", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{use British English|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Peter the Hermit.jpg|thumb|Miniature of [[Peter the Hermit]] leading the [[People's Crusade]] ([[Egerton Collection|Egerton]] 1500, Avignon, 14th{{nbsp}}century)|alt=14th-century miniature of Peter the Hermit leading the People's Crusade]] \nThe '''[[historiography]] of the [[Crusades]]''', and popular memories of them, have been subject to competing interpretations since the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, and possibly even before, right up to the current day. The religious idealism, use of martial force and the pragmatic compromises made by those involved in crusading were controversial at the time and the subsequent debates that followed often remained controversal. While the theory and practice of crusading always maintained a rhetorical, legal, and emotional connection with the [[Holy Land]], these also proved applicable to other areas of interest to the [[Catholic Church]]. These areas of interest included the conquest of [[Al-Andalus]], German annexation of the pagan territory in the [[Baltic Region]], suppression of heresy and the assertion of papal control in Germany and Italy. The wars created a body of literature and liturgy, as well as new religious orders. Crusading became integral to Western European culture and continued shaping behaviours through the [[Late Middle Ages]] and in word rather than action beyond the [[15th&nbsp;century]].\n\nFrom the 17th&nbsp;century historians began rejecting religious interpretations and instead examined the Crusades as the origins of nation building, government, commerce, and modern civilisation. From this period they began considering that secular and religious motivations were fundamentally different and it was found that agreeing a consensus reconciling the idealistic and the materialistic was challenging. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers considered the crusaders culturally inferior to themselves and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] considered them morally so.\n\nThe internationalism of crusading presented obstacles to those historians wishing to project both the idea of crusading and the Crusades themselves as a nationalistic ideal. By the [[19th&nbsp;century]] the development of nationalism, colonial politics, and critical history increased interest in the subject for the purposes of entertainment and moralising. In the early [[20th&nbsp;century]] a focus developed on the part crusades played as drivers of medieval conquest and economics and the leagacy this left. This was reinforced by the establishment of Israel in 1948 which prompted efforts to draw historical parallels that still reverberate today. Crusading historiography continues to develop reflecting a range of issues: belief systems, identity, economics, politics, imperialism, colonialism, ideology, legitimacy, pathological violence, warfare, the impact on non-combatants, inter-faith and inter-ethnic relations, state building, and propaganda.\n\n==Terminology==\n\nIn modern [[historiography]], the term \"crusade\" first referred to a military expedition undertaken by European Christians in the 11th, 12th, or 13th{{nbsp}}centuries to the [[Holy Land]]. The conflicts to which the term was applied were later extended to include other campaigns initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against [[paganism|pagans]] and [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]] or for other alleged religious ends.<ref>{{OED|crusades}}</ref> From the first papal decree in 1095, these differed from other Christian religious wars in that they were considered a [[Repentance (Christianity)|penitential]] exercise rewarding the participants with forgiveness for all confessed sins. [[Pope Urban II]] was recorded to have said, as translated by [[Robert Somerville]], ''whoever for devotion alone not to obtain honour or money, goes to Jerusalem to liberate the Church of God can substitute the journey for all penance''.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=1}} \n\nThe usage of the term \"crusade\" can create a misleading impression of coherence, particularly regarding the early Crusades, and the definition is a matter of historiographical debate among contemporary historians.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=40}} At the time of the [[First Crusade]], {{lang|la|iter}}, \"journey\", and {{lang|la|peregrinatio}}, \"pilgrimage\" were used as the descriptions of the campaign. Crusader terminology remained largely indistinguishable from that of Christian pilgrimage during the 12th{{nbsp}}century. Only at the end of the century was a specific language of crusading adopted in the form of {{lang|la|crucesignatus}}{{mdash}}\"one signed by the cross\"{{mdash}}for a crusader. This led to the French {{lang|fr|croisade}}{{mdash}}the way of the cross.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=40}} By the mid 13th{{nbsp}}century the cross became the major descriptor of the crusades with {{lang|la|crux transmarina}}{{mdash}}\"the cross overseas\"{{mdash}}used for crusades across the Mediterranean Sea, and {{lang|la|crux cismarina}}{{mdash}}\"the cross this side of the sea\"{{mdash}}for those in Europe.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=5}}<ref>{{OED|Outremer}}</ref> \n\nDating from the early 1700s, the modern English word \"crusade\" is derived from Spanish, French and Latin.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=77}} The Arabic word for struggle or contest, particularly one for the propagation of Islam{{mdash}}{{lang|ar|[[jih\u0101d]]}}{{mdash}}was used for a religious war by Muslims against [[Kafir|unbelievers]], that was often taught as a [[Hadith|traditional]] duty.<ref>{{OED|jihad}}</ref>  The Crusader states of Syria and Palestine were known as the \"[[Outremer]]\" from the [[French language|French]] ''outre-mer'', or \"the land beyond the sea\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=105}}\n\n==Background==\n\nThe near constant stream of military campaigns from Europe to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] make it virtually impossible to differentiate separate campaigns. French Catholic lawyer [[\u00c9tienne Pasquier]] (1529\u20131615) was one of the first to make an attempt, numbering the Crusades at six.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=47\u201350}} The most commonly accepted numbering holds the First Crusade between 1096 and 1099 with a [[Crusade of 1101|second wave 1101-1102]], the [[Second Crusade|Second]] (1146-1149), the [[Third Crusade|Third]] (1187-1192), [[Fourth Crusade|Fourth]] (1198-1204), and the [[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]] (1217-21). [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] led a major campaign in the [[Sixth Crusade]] (1228-1229), as did [[Louis IX of France]] in the [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]] (1248-1254) before dying on a campaign in the [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]] in Tunisia (1270). [[Crusader States]] were established in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] that lasted in some shape or form from 1098 for two centuries. Jerusalem was held from 1099 to 1187 and from 1229 to 1244. Cyprus was ruled by Western Europeans from 1191 until 1571. The [[East\u2013West Schism]] between the Roman Catholic Church of Western Europe and the Greek Orthodox Church of the Near and Middle East became irrevocable after the [[looting|sacking]] of the Greek Christian capital of [[Constantinople]]. These wars were supported by new traditions, ideologies, and institutions such as the wearing of the cross, awards of spiritual privileges, the idea these were armed pilgrimages, protections from lawsuits and debt repayment, and church protection for a crusader's property and family property and family.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=1\u20136}}\n\n==Medieval==\n\nOriginally, medieval understanding of the Crusades was narrowly focused on a limited set of interrelated texts, most notably ''[[{{lang|la|Gesta Francorum}}]]'' which possibly dates from as early as 1099. The ''Gesta'' was reworked by [[Robert of Rheims]] who created a [[Popery and Papism|papalist]], northern French template for later works. These all demonstrated a degree of martial advocacy that attributed both success and failure to God's will.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=8\u201312}} This clerical view was soon challenged by vernacular adventure stories based on the work of [[Albert of Aachen]]. [[William of Tyre]] expanded on Albert's writing in his ''Historia''. Completed by 1184, William's work describes the warrior state the Outremer had become through the tensions between [[divine providence]] and humankind.{{sfn|Tyerman |2011|pp=16\u201317}} Medieval crusade historiography remained more interested in presenting moralistic lessons than information and praised the crusades as a moral exemplar and a cultural norm.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=32}}\n\n==Reformation==\n\nAttitudes toward the crusades during the Reformation were shaped by the fragmentation of Christian religious orthodoxy and Ottoman territorial expansion. The Papacy continued to authorise crusades in the 16th{{nbsp}}century such as: in the 1520s for the defence of Central Europe, in 1536 in England for the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], in 1571 the [[Battle of Lepanto]] and in 1588 for the [[Spanish Armada]]. An additional example of the continued currency of crusading rhetoric was the granting of indulgences for  for killing [[Huguenots]] in  1568. However after this, Papal calls no longer saw unforced popular support and familiarity with the instituitions and language of crusading diminished. The process of challenging the legality of religiously motivated warfare that began in 12th and 13th{{nbsp}}centuries reached a peak in the legal writing of [[Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] in the late 16th and early 17th{{nbsp}}centuries. Lutherans and Protestants went further, with the consensus among intellectuals that only secular rationales such as the defence of legally held territory justified fighting Muslims. [[Just war]] concepts replaced those of [[Holy war]] in legitimising conflict, making possible a non-sectarian justification for fighting the Turks.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nProtestant [[Martyrology|martyrologist]] [[John Foxe]] blamed the sins of the Catholic Church for the failure of the crusades in his ''History of the Turks'' (1566). He also condemned the use of the crusades against those he considered had maintained the faith, such as the Albigensians and [[Waldensians]]. Lutheran scholar Matthew Dresser (1536\u20131607) extended this view. The crusaders were lauded for their faith, but Urban II's motivation was seen as part of his conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]]. On this view, the crusades were flawed and the idea of restoring the physical Holy Places was \"detestable superstition\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=38\u201342}} Pasquier highlighted the failures of the crusades and the damage that religious conflict had inflicted on France and the church. He emphasised the experience of the victims of papal aggression, the sale of [[indulgences]], abuses by the church, corruption, and conflict at home.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=47\u201350}}\n\n==Enlightenment==\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades richard and saladin at the battle of arsuf.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871):''[[Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]] in the [[Battle of Arsuf]]'']][[Age of Enlightenment]] philosopher historians such as [[David Hume]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Edward Gibbon]] used crusading as a conceptual tool to critique religion, civilisation, and cultural mores. In their view the sole positive effect of crusading was the increasing liberty that municipalities were able to purchase from feudal lords, which had enabled towns to become the source of a new civilised rationality. This was contrasted with a view of the negatives of crusading that included depopulation, economic ruin, the abuse of papal authority, irresponsibilty and barbarism. In turn, these opinions were then criticised in the 19th{{nbsp}}century by crusade enthusiasts as being unnecessarily hostile to, and ignorant of, the crusades.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=79}} \n\nAlternatively,  [[Claude Fleury]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] proposed that the crusades were one stage in the improvement of European civilisation; that paradigm was further developed by [[Rationalism|rationalists]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=67}} In France the idea that the crusades were an important part of national history and identity continued to evolve. In scholarly literature, the term \"holy war\" was replaced by the neutral German ''kreuzzug'' and French ''croisade''.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=71}} Gibbon followed [[Thomas Fuller]] in dismissing the concept that the crusades were a legitimate defence as they were disproportionate to the threat presented. Palestine was an objective, not because of reason but because of fanaticism and superstition.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=87}} [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] expanded on Fleury in a new, empirical, objective approach; placing crusading in a narrative of the road to modernity. The cultural consequences of progress, growth in trade and the rise of the Italian cities are elaborated in his work. In this he influenced his student [[Walter Scott]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=80\u201386}} \n\nMuch of the popular understanding of the crusades today derives from the 19th{{nbsp}}century novels of Scott and the histories of [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Michaud]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=448\u2013456}} Scott published four crusades-based novels between 1819 and 1831 viewing the crusades as incursions of glamorous but uneducated western Europeans into a superior civilisation. Michaud published his influential ''Histoire des croisades'' between 1812 and 1822 depicting the crusades as glorious instruments of French nationalism and proto-imperialism. [[Charles Mills (historian)|Charles Mills]] followed the Gibbon approach critical of Michaud's histories in his ''[[History of the crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the Holy Land]]'' in 1820, but he also praised crusader chivalry as he did in 1825 with his ''History of Chivalry''.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=118\u2013121}} These incompatible views agreed only on the idea that a crusade was defined by its opposition to Islam. Scott's description of an inferior culture attacking a more sophisticated one mixed with Michaud's proto-colonialist conviction. By the 1950s this established a neo-imperialistic and materialistic orthodoxy  that remains the popular perception.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xiv}}</ref> The [[Romantics]] and conservative adherents of the European {{lang|fr|[[anciens r\u00e9gimes]]}} appropriated crusading imagery for their own political goals, downplaying religion to fit it within a modern, secular context and presenting crusades as a counterpoint to liberal ideas of nationalism.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xiv}} Future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] showed a deep interest in crusading, in 1831 he visited the Near East and in 1847 wrote a crusade novel in 1847, called both ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred]]'' or ''The New Crusade''.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=672}}\n\nThe ''[[Salle des Croisades]]'' in the north wing of the  [[Palace of Versailles]] opened in 1843, commissioned by King [[Louis-Philippe]] when France was seized with enthusiasm with its historical past, particularly the period of the crusades. The rooms are filled with over 120 paintings related to the crusades.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2008|p=54}}. In 1833 the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] revived longstanding [[Maurist|Congregation of Saint Maur]] ambitions to create a collection of crusade sources for the glory of France, resulting in the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]''. The laws were published in two volumes in 1841 and 1843. Six volumes by western historians follwed between 1844-1895; five collections of French translations of eastern texts between 1872-1906; two volumes of Greek sources in 1875 and 1881; and two Armenian volumes in 1869 and 1906 that included related miscellania.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\n==Modern==\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, had the most significant impact on crusades' historiography since Michaud. However, academic crusade historians considered it a dated polemic that was derivative, tendentious and misleading even at the time. Owing much in style to the works of Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]], Runciman used literary devices such as imagining the thoughts of historical figures and even inventing fictitious events. The first volume is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]], the second on William of Tyre and the third on the {{lang|fr|[[Les Gestes des Chiprois]]}}, [[Niketas Choniates]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Grousset]]. Runciman's premise was based on ideas about the \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nPrior to the late 20th{{nbsp}}century no serious thought had been given to defining what was meant by \"crusade\" and its scope; it was assumed it meant only Christian attempts to recover Jerusalem. Not much reflection was given to the inclusion from the [[Early Modern Period]] of other theatres of war. The German historian [[Carl Erdmann]] presented a significant challenge, theorising that crusading was a political ideology within Western society rather than a glamourised frontier conflict. By 1977 Riley-Smith, who was a dominant influential figure in academic crusade studies, proposed a wider definition.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=218\u2013221}} The key to definition rested with papal authority.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xi}} \n\nIn a 2001 article{{mdash}}''The Historiography of the Crusades''{{mdash}}[[Giles Constable]] attempted to categorise contemporary crusade study into four areas with differing definitions of what is meant by ''crusade''. His view was that ''Traditionalists'' such as [[Hans Eberhard Mayer]] are concerned with where the crusades were aimed, ''Pluralists'' such as Riley-Smith concentrate on how the crusades were organised, ''Popularists'' including Paul Alphandery and Etienne Delaruelle focus on the popular groundswells of religious fervour and ''Generalists'' such as Ernst-Dieter Hehl focus on the phenomenon of Latin holy wars.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=225\u2013226}}{{sfn|Constable|2001|pp=1\u201322}}\n\nHistorical parallelism and the tradition of drawing inspiration from the Middle Ages have become keystones of [[political Islam]] encouraging ideas of a modern jihad and long struggle while secular [[Arab nationalism]] highlights the role of [[Western imperialism]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=675\u2013680}} Muslim thinkers, politicians, and historians have drawn parallels between the crusades and modern political developments such as the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment]] of Israel in 1948.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=674\u2013675}} Right-wing circles in the [[Western world]] have drawn opposing parallels by considering Christianity to be under an Islamic religious and demographic threat that is analogous to the situation at the time of the crusades. Crusader symbols and [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric are presented as an appropriate response, even if only for [[propaganda]] purposes. These symbols and rhetoric are used to provide a religious justification and inspiration for a struggle against a religious enemy.{{sfn|Koch|2017|p=1}} Madden argued that modern tensions are the result of a constructed view of the crusades created by colonial powers in the 19th{{nbsp}}century and transmitted into Arab nationalism. For him the crusades are a medieval phenomenon in which the crusaders were engaged in a [[defensive war]] war on behalf of their co-religionists.{{sfn|Madden|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\nIn recent decades historians have deployed new approaches borrowed from gender studies and literary theory to examine the validity of narrative sources, developing insight on the experiences and representation of women within the context of the crusades.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=216\u2013217, 235}}\n\n==Colonialism and nationalism==\n\nFrench historians such as Emmanuel Rey, [[Louis Madelin]] and Ren\u00e9 Grousset developed the thinking of Michaud, espoused propaganda of the country's Mediterranean colonies, and provided a source of popular models that were criticised and dismantled when empires ceased to hold academic approval. {{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=116\u2013117}} [[Early modern period]] and [[Francisco Franco]]-era Spain presented a special case where nationalism and national identity could be projected onto the crusades.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=4}} \n\nThe German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] demonstrated an appitite to exploit the crsuades for political advantage with ostentatious tour of the Levant in 1898. He paraded into Jerusalem on a white horse and laid a bronze wreath on the [[Mausoleum of Saladin]] in Damascus. Through this he associated the crusades with the development of German and Western European culture.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=139\u2013140}} In contrast, during [[World War&nbsp;I]] when [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] led a polyglot Allied army, including Muslims, into Jerusalem in December 1917 he was very conscious of possible offence arising from crusading rhetoric or triumphalism. Unlike Wilhelm, he entered on foot and ordered his troops not to refer to the crusades. The British media were not so sensitive. Instead it revelled in medieval analogies and misattributed to Allenby the [[apocrypha]]l, but repeated quote ''Today the wars of the crusades are ended''.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=673\u2013674}}\n\nBritish historians took a less ideological approach compared with Spain, France, Germany and Italy.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n== Islam ==\n\n{{see also|Islamic views on the crusades}}\n\nThe Muslim world exhibited little interest in the crusades as they were not considered significant events until the middle of the 19th{{nbsp}}century. One explanation is that they were considered a more marginal issue compared to the collapse of the [[Caliphate]] through the [[Mongol invasions]] and the replacement of [[Arabs|Arab]] rule by the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]], who suppressed Arab nationalism for the following seven centuries. Carole Hillenbrand argued that Arab historians have often taken a Western viewpoint because they have historically been opposed to Turkish control of their homelands.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=5}}\n\nArabic-speaking Syrian Christians began translating French histories into Arabic, leading to the replacement of the term \"wars of the {{lang|ar|Ifranj}}\"{{snd}}Franks{{snd}}with {{lang|ar|al-hurub al Salabiyya}}{{snd}}\"wars of the Cross\". The Ottoman Turk [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] published the first modern Saladin biography in 1872. Kaiser Wilhelm's Jerusalem visit in 1898 prompted further interest, with the Egyptian Sayyid Ali al-Hariri producing the first Arabic history of the crusades. Modern studies were driven by political purposes in the hope of learning from the Muslim forces' triumph over their enemies.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=675\u2013677}} Before Wilhelm's visit, [[Saladin]]'s Western reputation for chivalry was not reflected in the Muslim world. He had had been largely forgotten and eclipsed by more successful figures such as [[Baybars]] of Egypt. The visit and anti-imperialist sentiment led to the reinvention of his reputation by nationalist Arabs as a hero of the struggle against the West.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2009|pp=6\u201366}} Modern Arab states have sought to commemorate Saladin through various measures, often based on the image created of him in the 19th-century west.{{sfn|Madden|2013|pp=201\u2013204}}\n\n==Primary Sources==\n\n*''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' (ed. 1841&ndash;1906) including the twelve surviving chronicles of the First Crusade:{{sfn|Dass|2011|p=119}}\n:*Anonymous, ''[[Gesta Francorum]]''\n:*Anonymous, ''[[Historia belli sacri]]''\n:*[[Albert of Aachen]], ''Historia Ierosolimitana''\n:*[[Baldric of Dol]], ''Historia Hierosolymitana''\n:*[[Ekkehard of Aura]], ''De oppressione liberatione ac restautatione Jerosolymitanae ecclesiae''\n:*[[Fulcher of Chartres]], ''Historia Hierosolymitana''\n:* Fulcher of Chartres, ''Gesta Francorum Hierusalem expugnantium'' (epitome of prev.)\n:*[[Guibert of Nogent]], ''Dei gesta per Francos''\n:*[[Peter Tudebode]], ''Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere''\n:*[[Ralph of Caen]], ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]''\n:*[[Raymond of Aguilers]] and [[Pons of Balazun]], ''[[Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem]]''\n:*Robert of Rheims, ''[[Historia Hierosolymitana (Robert the Monk)|Historia Hierosolymitana]]''\n\n;Armenian historians of the crusades include{{sfn|MacEvitt|2014|pp=260\u2013275}}\n:*[[Matthew of Edessa]] (d. 1144)\n:*[[Nerses IV|Nerses Shnorhali]] (d. 1173)\n:*[[Michael the Syrian]] (d. 1199)\n:*[[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]] (d. 1271)\n:*[[Nerses of Lambron]] (d. 1198)\n:*[[Sempad the Constable]] (d. 1276)\n:*[[Hayton of Corycus]] (fl. 1307).\n\n;Muslim historians include{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|pp=9\u201330}}\n:*[[Ali ibn al-Athir]] (d. 1233), \n:*[[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]] (d. 1234)\n:*[[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd al-Latif]] (d. 1231)\n:*[[Ibn Jubayr]] (d. 1217)\n:*[[Ibn Khallikan]] (d. 1282)\n:*[[Abu al-Feda]] (d. 1331).\n\n;Contemporary Jewish accounts include{{sfn|Cohen|2013|pp=6\u20137, 31\u201354, 92\u2013105}}\n:*''[[Solomon bar Simson Chronicle]]'' (c. 1140)\n:* The chronicle of [[Eliezer bar Nathan]] (d. 1170)\n:* The ''[[Mainz Anonymous]]''\n:* The works of [[Ephraim of Bonn]] (d. 1200).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Jeremy |title=Sanctifying the name of God: Jewish martyrs and Jewish memories of the First Crusade|year=2013|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=978-0-8122-3780-1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S2IUBAAAQBAJ&|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Constable|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Constable|editor=Angeliki E.

The religious idealism, use of martial force and the pragmatic compromises made by those involved in crusading were controversial at the time and the subsequent debates that followed often remained controversal. While the theory and practice of crusading always maintained a rhetorical, legal, and emotional connection with the [[Holy Land]], these also proved applicable to other areas of interest to the [[Catholic Church]]. These areas of interest included the conquest of [[Al-Andalus]], German annexation of the pagan territory in the [[Baltic Region]], suppression of heresy and the assertion of papal control in Germany and Italy. The wars created a body of literature and liturgy, as well as new religious orders. Crusading became integral to Western European culture and continued shaping behaviours through the [[Late Middle Ages]] and in word rather than action beyond the [[15th&nbsp;century]].\n\nFrom the 17th&nbsp;century historians began rejecting religious interpretations and instead examined the Crusades as the origins of nation building, government, commerce, and modern civilisation. From this period they began considering that secular and religious motivations were fundamentally different and it was found that agreeing a consensus reconciling the idealistic and the materialistic was challenging. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers considered the crusaders culturally inferior to themselves and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] considered them morally so.\n\nThe internationalism of crusading presented obstacles to those historians wishing to project both the idea of crusading and the Crusades themselves as a nationalistic ideal. By the [[19th&nbsp;century]] the development of nationalism, colonial politics, and critical history increased interest in the subject for the purposes of entertainment and moralising. In the early [[20th&nbsp;century]] a focus developed on the part crusades played as drivers of medieval conquest and economics and the leagacy this left. This was reinforced by the establishment of Israel in 1948 which prompted efforts to draw historical parallels that still reverberate today. Crusading historiography continues to develop reflecting a range of issues: belief systems, identity, economics, politics, imperialism, colonialism, ideology, legitimacy, pathological violence, warfare, the impact on non-combatants, inter-faith and inter-ethnic relations, state building, and propaganda.\n\n==Terminology==\n\nIn modern [[historiography]], the term \"crusade\" first referred to a military expedition undertaken by European Christians in the 11th, 12th, or 13th{{nbsp}}centuries to the [[Holy Land]]. The conflicts to which the term was applied were later extended to include other campaigns initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against [[paganism|pagans]] and [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]] or for other alleged religious ends.<ref>{{OED|crusades}}</ref> From the first papal decree in 1095, these differed from other Christian religious wars in that they were considered a [[Repentance (Christianity)|penitential]] exercise rewarding the participants with forgiveness for all confessed sins. [[Pope Urban II]] was recorded to have said, as translated by [[Robert Somerville]], ''whoever for devotion alone not to obtain honour or money, goes to Jerusalem to liberate the Church of God can substitute the journey for all penance''.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=1}} \n\nThe usage of the term \"crusade\" can create a misleading impression of coherence, particularly regarding the early Crusades, and the definition is a matter of historiographical debate among contemporary historians.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=40}} At the time of the [[First Crusade]], {{lang|la|iter}}, \"journey\", and {{lang|la|peregrinatio}}, \"pilgrimage\" were used as the descriptions of the campaign. Crusader terminology remained largely indistinguishable from that of Christian pilgrimage during the 12th{{nbsp}}century. Only at the end of the century was a specific language of crusading adopted in the form of {{lang|la|crucesignatus}}{{mdash}}\"one signed by the cross\"{{mdash}}for a crusader. This led to the French {{lang|fr|croisade}}{{mdash}}the way of the cross.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=40}} By the mid 13th{{nbsp}}century the cross became the major descriptor of the crusades with {{lang|la|crux transmarina}}{{mdash}}\"the cross overseas\"{{mdash}}used for crusades across the Mediterranean Sea, and {{lang|la|crux cismarina}}{{mdash}}\"the cross this side of the sea\"{{mdash}}for those in Europe.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=5}}<ref>{{OED|Outremer}}</ref> \n\nDating from the early 1700s, the modern English word \"crusade\" is derived from Spanish, French and Latin.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=77}} The Arabic word for struggle or contest, particularly one for the propagation of Islam{{mdash}}{{lang|ar|[[jih\u0101d]]}}{{mdash}}was used for a religious war by Muslims against [[Kafir|unbelievers]], that was often taught as a [[Hadith|traditional]] duty.<ref>{{OED|jihad}}</ref>  The Crusader states of Syria and Palestine were known as the \"[[Outremer]]\" from the [[French language|French]] ''outre-mer'', or \"the land beyond the sea\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=105}}\n\n==Background==\n\nThe near constant stream of military campaigns from Europe to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] make it virtually impossible to differentiate separate campaigns. French Catholic lawyer [[\u00c9tienne Pasquier]] (1529\u20131615) was one of the first to make an attempt, numbering the Crusades at six.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=47\u201350}} The most commonly accepted numbering holds the First Crusade between 1096 and 1099 with a [[Crusade of 1101|second wave 1101-1102]], the [[Second Crusade|Second]] (1146-1149), the [[Third Crusade|Third]] (1187-1192), [[Fourth Crusade|Fourth]] (1198-1204), and the [[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]] (1217-21). [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] led a major campaign in the [[Sixth Crusade]] (1228-1229), as did [[Louis IX of France]] in the [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]] (1248-1254) before dying on a campaign in the [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]] in Tunisia (1270). [[Crusader States]] were established in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] that lasted in some shape or form from 1098 for two centuries. Jerusalem was held from 1099 to 1187 and from 1229 to 1244. Cyprus was ruled by Western Europeans from 1191 until 1571. The [[East\u2013West Schism]] between the Roman Catholic Church of Western Europe and the Greek Orthodox Church of the Near and Middle East became irrevocable after the [[looting|sacking]] of the Greek Christian capital of [[Constantinople]]. These wars were supported by new traditions, ideologies, and institutions such as the wearing of the cross, awards of spiritual privileges, the idea these were armed pilgrimages, protections from lawsuits and debt repayment, and church protection for for a crusader's property and family property and family.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=1\u20136}}\n\n==Medieval==\n\nOriginally, medieval understanding of the Crusades was narrowly focused on a limited set of interrelated texts, most notably ''[[{{lang|la|Gesta Francorum}}]]'' which possibly dates from as early as 1099. The ''Gesta'' was reworked by [[Robert of Rheims]] who created a [[Popery and Papism|papalist]], northern French template for later works. These all demonstrated a degree of martial advocacy that attributed both success and failure to God's will.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=8\u201312}} This clerical view was soon challenged by vernacular adventure stories based on the work of [[Albert of Aachen]]. [[William of Tyre]] expanded on Albert's writing in his ''Historia''. Completed by 1184, William's work describes the warrior state the Outremer had become through the tensions between [[divine providence]] and humankind.{{sfn|Tyerman |2011|pp=16\u201317}} Medieval crusade historiography remained more interested in presenting moralistic lessons than information and praised the crusades as a moral exemplar and a cultural norm.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=32}}\n\n==Reformation==\n\nAttitudes toward the crusades during the Reformation were shaped by the fragmentation of Christian religious orthodoxy and Ottoman territorial expansion. The Papacy continued to authorise crusades in the 16th{{nbsp}}century such as: in the 1520s for the defence of Central Europe, in 1536 in England for the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], in 1571 the [[Battle of Lepanto]] and in 1588 for the [[Spanish Armada]]. An additional example of the continued currency of crusading rhetoric was the granting of indulgences for  for killing [[Huguenots]] in  1568. However after this, Papal calls no longer saw unforced popular support and familiarity with the instituitions and language of crusading diminished. The process of challenging the legality of religiously motivated warfare that began in 12th and 13th{{nbsp}}centuries reached a peak in the legal writing of [[Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] in the late 16th and early 17th{{nbsp}}centuries. Lutherans and Protestants went further, with the consensus among intellectuals that only secular rationales such as the defence of legally held territory justified fighting Muslims. [[Just war]] concepts replaced those of [[Holy war]] in legitimising conflict, making possible a non-sectarian justification for fighting the Turks.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nProtestant [[Martyrology|martyrologist]] [[John Foxe]] blamed the sins of the Catholic Church for the failure of the crusades in his ''History of the Turks'' (1566). He also condemned the use of the crusades against those he considered had maintained the faith, such as the Albigensians and [[Waldensians]]. Lutheran scholar Matthew Dresser (1536\u20131607) extended this view. The crusaders were lauded for their faith, but Urban II's motivation was seen as part of his conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]]. On this view, the crusades were flawed and the idea of restoring the physical Holy Places was \"detestable superstition\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=38\u201342}} Pasquier highlighted the failures of the crusades and the damage that religious conflict had inflicted on France and the church. He emphasised the experience of the victims of papal aggression, the sale of [[indulgences]], abuses by the church, corruption, and conflict at home.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=47\u201350}}\n\n==Enlightenment==\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades richard and saladin at the battle of arsuf.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871):''[[Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]] in the [[Battle of Arsuf]]'']][[Age of Enlightenment]] philosopher historians such as [[David Hume]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Edward Gibbon]] used crusading as a conceptual tool to critique religion, civilisation, and cultural mores. In their view the sole positive effect of crusading was the increasing liberty that municipalities were able to purchase from feudal lords, which had enabled towns to become the source of a new civilised rationality. This was contrasted with a view of the negatives of crusading that included depopulation, economic ruin, the abuse of papal authority, irresponsibilty and barbarism. In turn, these opinions were then criticised in the 19th{{nbsp}}century by crusade enthusiasts as being unnecessarily hostile to, and ignorant of, the crusades.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=79}} \n\nAlternatively,  [[Claude Fleury]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] proposed that the crusades were one stage in the improvement of European civilisation; that paradigm was further developed by [[Rationalism|rationalists]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=67}} In France the idea that the crusades were an important part of national history and identity continued to evolve. In scholarly literature, the term \"holy war\" was replaced by the neutral German ''kreuzzug'' and French ''croisade''.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=71}} Gibbon followed [[Thomas Fuller]] in dismissing the concept that the crusades were a legitimate defence as they were disproportionate to the threat presented. Palestine was an objective, not because of reason but because of fanaticism and superstition.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=87}} [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] expanded on Fleury in a new, empirical, objective approach; placing crusading in a narrative of the road to modernity. The cultural consequences of progress, growth in trade and the rise of the Italian cities are elaborated in his work. In this he influenced his student [[Walter Scott]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=80\u201386}} \n\nMuch of the popular understanding of the crusades today derives from the 19th{{nbsp}}century novels of Scott and the histories of [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Michaud]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=448\u2013456}} Scott published four crusades-based novels between 1819 and 1831 viewing the crusades as incursions of glamorous but uneducated western Europeans into a superior civilisation. Michaud published his influential ''Histoire des croisades'' between 1812 and 1822 depicting the crusades as glorious instruments of French nationalism and proto-imperialism. [[Charles Mills (historian)|Charles Mills]] followed the Gibbon approach critical of Michaud's histories in his ''[[History of the crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the Holy Land]]'' in 1820, but he also praised crusader chivalry as he did in 1825 with his ''History of Chivalry''.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=118\u2013121}} These incompatible views agreed only on the idea that a crusade was defined by its opposition to Islam. Scott's description of an inferior culture attacking a more sophisticated one mixed with Michaud's proto-colonialist conviction. By the 1950s this established a neo-imperialistic and materialistic orthodoxy  that remains the popular perception.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xiv}}</ref> The [[Romantics]] and conservative adherents of the European {{lang|fr|[[anciens r\u00e9gimes]]}} appropriated crusading imagery for their own political goals, downplaying religion to fit it within a modern, secular context and presenting crusades as a counterpoint to liberal ideas of nationalism.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xiv}} Future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] showed a deep interest in crusading, in 1831 he visited the Near East and in 1847 wrote a crusade novel in 1847, called both ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred]]'' or ''The New Crusade''.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=672}}\n\nThe ''[[Salle des Croisades]]'' in the north wing of the  [[Palace of Versailles]] opened in 1843, commissioned by King [[Louis-Philippe]] when France was seized with enthusiasm with its historical past, particularly the period of the crusades. The rooms are filled with over 120 paintings related to the crusades.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2008|p=54}}. In 1833 the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] revived longstanding [[Maurist|Congregation of Saint Maur]] ambitions to create a collection of crusade sources for the glory of France, resulting in the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]''. The laws were published in two volumes in 1841 and 1843. Six volumes by western historians follwed between 1844-1895; five collections of French translations of eastern texts between 1872-1906; two volumes of Greek sources in 1875 and 1881; and two Armenian volumes in 1869 and 1906 that included related miscellania.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\n==Modern==\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, had the most significant impact on crusades' historiography since Michaud. However, academic crusade historians considered it a dated polemic that was derivative, tendentious and misleading even at the time. Owing much in style to the works of Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]], Runciman used literary devices such as imagining the thoughts of historical figures and even inventing fictitious events. The first volume is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]], the second on William of Tyre and the third on the {{lang|fr|[[Les Gestes des Chiprois]]}}, [[Niketas Choniates]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Grousset]]. Runciman's premise was based on ideas about the \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nPrior to the late 20th{{nbsp}}century no serious thought had been given to defining what was meant by \"crusade\" and its scope; it was assumed it meant only Christian attempts to recover Jerusalem. Not much reflection was given to the inclusion from the [[Early Modern Period]] of other theatres of war. The German historian [[Carl Erdmann]] presented a significant challenge, theorising that crusading was a political ideology within Western society rather than a glamourised frontier conflict. By 1977 Riley-Smith, who was a dominant influential figure in academic crusade studies, proposed a wider definition.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=218\u2013221}} The key to definition rested with papal authority.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xi}} \n\nIn a 2001 article{{mdash}}''The Historiography of the Crusades''{{mdash}}[[Giles Constable]] attempted to categorise contemporary crusade study into four areas with differing definitions of what is meant by ''crusade''. His view was that ''Traditionalists'' such as [[Hans Eberhard Mayer]] are concerned with where the crusades were aimed, ''Pluralists'' such as Riley-Smith concentrate on how the crusades were organised, ''Popularists'' including Paul Alphandery and Etienne Delaruelle focus on the popular groundswells of religious fervour and ''Generalists'' such as Ernst-Dieter Hehl focus on the phenomenon of Latin holy wars.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=225\u2013226}}{{sfn|Constable|2001|pp=1\u201322}}\n\nHistorical parallelism and the tradition of drawing inspiration from the Middle Ages have become keystones of [[political Islam]] encouraging ideas of a modern jihad and long struggle while secular [[Arab nationalism]] highlights the role of [[Western imperialism]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=675\u2013680}} Muslim thinkers, politicians, and historians have drawn parallels between the crusades and modern political developments such as the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment]] of Israel in 1948.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=674\u2013675}} Right-wing circles in the [[Western world]] have drawn opposing parallels by considering Christianity to be under an Islamic religious and demographic threat that is analogous to the situation at the time of the crusades. Crusader symbols and [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric are presented as an appropriate response, even if only for [[propaganda]] purposes. These symbols and rhetoric are used to provide a religious justification and inspiration for a struggle against a religious enemy.{{sfn|Koch|2017|p=1}} Madden argued that modern tensions are the result of a constructed view of the crusades created by colonial powers in the 19th{{nbsp}}century and transmitted into Arab nationalism. For him the crusades are a medieval phenomenon in which the crusaders were engaged in a [[defensive war]] war on behalf of their co-religionists.{{sfn|Madden|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\nIn recent decades historians have deployed new approaches borrowed from gender studies and literary theory to examine the validity of narrative sources, developing insight on the experiences and representation of women within the context of the crusades.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=216\u2013217, 235}}\n\n==Colonialism and nationalism==\n\nFrench historians such as Emmanuel Rey, [[Louis Madelin]] and Ren\u00e9 Grousset developed the thinking of Michaud, espoused propaganda of the country's Mediterranean colonies, and provided a source of popular models that were criticised and dismantled when empires ceased to hold academic approval. {{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=116\u2013117}} [[Early modern period]] and [[Francisco Franco]]-era Spain presented a special case where nationalism and national identity could be projected onto the crusades.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|p=4}} \n\nThe German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] demonstrated an appitite to exploit the crsuades for political advantage with ostentatious tour of the Levant in 1898. He paraded into Jerusalem on a white horse and laid a bronze wreath on the [[Mausoleum of Saladin]] in Damascus. Through this he associated the crusades with the development of German and Western European culture.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=139\u2013140}} In contrast, during [[World War&nbsp;I]] when [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] led a polyglot Allied army, including Muslims, into Jerusalem in December 1917 he was very conscious of possible offence arising from crusading rhetoric or triumphalism. Unlike Wilhelm, he entered on foot and ordered his troops not to refer to the crusades. The British media were not so sensitive. Instead it revelled in medieval analogies and misattributed to Allenby the [[apocrypha]]l, but repeated quote ''Today the wars of the crusades are ended''.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=673\u2013674}}\n\nBritish historians took a less ideological approach compared with Spain, France, Germany and Italy.{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n== Islam ==\n\n{{see also|Islamic views on the crusades}}\n\nThe Muslim world exhibited little interest in the crusades as they were not considered significant events until the middle of the 19th{{nbsp}}century. One explanation is that they were considered a more marginal issue compared to the collapse of the [[Caliphate]] through the [[Mongol invasions]] and the replacement of [[Arabs|Arab]] rule by the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]], who suppressed Arab nationalism for the following seven centuries. Carole Hillenbrand argued that Arab historians have often taken a Western viewpoint because they have historically been opposed to Turkish control of their homelands.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=5}}\n\nArabic-speaking Syrian Christians began translating French histories into Arabic, leading to the replacement of the term \"wars of the {{lang|ar|Ifranj}}\"{{snd}}Franks{{snd}}with {{lang|ar|al-hurub al Salabiyya}}{{snd}}\"wars of the Cross\". The Ottoman Turk [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] published the first modern Saladin biography in 1872. Kaiser Wilhelm's Jerusalem visit in 1898 prompted further interest, with the Egyptian Sayyid Ali al-Hariri producing the first Arabic history of the crusades. Modern studies were driven by political purposes in the hope of learning from the Muslim forces' triumph over their enemies.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=675\u2013677}} Before Wilhelm's visit, [[Saladin]]'s Western reputation for chivalry was not reflected in the Muslim world. He had had been largely forgotten and eclipsed by more successful figures such as [[Baybars]] of Egypt. The visit and anti-imperialist sentiment led to the reinvention of his reputation by nationalist Arabs as a hero of the struggle against the West.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2009|pp=6\u201366}} Modern Arab states have sought to commemorate Saladin through various measures, often based on the image created of him in the 19th-century west.{{sfn|Madden|2013|pp=201\u2013204}}\n\n==Primary Sources==\n\n*''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' (ed. 1841&ndash;1906) including the twelve surviving chronicles of the First Crusade:{{sfn|Dass|2011|p=119}}\n:*Anonymous, ''[[Gesta Francorum]]''\n:*Anonymous, ''[[Historia belli sacri]]''\n:*[[Albert of Aachen]], ''Historia Ierosolimitana''\n:*[[Baldric of Dol]], ''Historia Hierosolymitana''\n:*[[Ekkehard of Aura]], ''De oppressione liberatione ac restautatione Jerosolymitanae ecclesiae''\n:*[[Fulcher of Chartres]], ''Historia Hierosolymitana''\n:* Fulcher of Chartres, ''Gesta Francorum Hierusalem expugnantium'' (epitome of prev.)\n:*[[Guibert of Nogent]], ''Dei gesta per Francos''\n:*[[Peter Tudebode]], ''Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere''\n:*[[Ralph of Caen]], ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]''\n:*[[Raymond of Aguilers]] and [[Pons of Balazun]], ''[[Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem]]''\n:*Robert of Rheims, ''[[Historia Hierosolymitana (Robert the Monk)|Historia Hierosolymitana]]''\n\n;Armenian historians of the crusades include{{sfn|MacEvitt|2014|pp=260\u2013275}}\n:*[[Matthew of Edessa]] (d. 1144)\n:*[[Nerses IV|Nerses Shnorhali]] (d. 1173)\n:*[[Michael the Syrian]] (d. 1199)\n:*[[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]] (d. 1271)\n:*[[Nerses of Lambron]] (d. 1198)\n:*[[Sempad the Constable]] (d. 1276)\n:*[[Hayton of Corycus]] (fl. 1307).\n\n;Muslim historians include{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|pp=9\u201330}}\n:*[[Ali ibn al-Athir]] (d. 1233), \n:*[[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]] (d. 1234)\n:*[[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd al-Latif]] (d. 1231)\n:*[[Ibn Jubayr]] (d. 1217)\n:*[[Ibn Khallikan]] (d. 1282)\n:*[[Abu al-Feda]] (d. 1331).\n\n;Contemporary Jewish accounts include{{sfn|Cohen|2013|pp=6\u20137, 31\u201354, 92\u2013105}}\n:*''[[Solomon bar Simson Chronicle]]'' (c. 1140)\n:* The chronicle of [[Eliezer bar Nathan]] (d. 1170)\n:* The ''[[Mainz Anonymous]]''\n:* The works of [[Ephraim of Bonn]] (d. 1200).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Jeremy |title=Sanctifying the name of God: Jewish martyrs and Jewish memories of the First Crusade|year=2013|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=978-0-8122-3780-1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S2IUBAAAQBAJ&|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Constable|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Constable|editor=Angeliki E.
