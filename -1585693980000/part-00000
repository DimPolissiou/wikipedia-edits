The west end is at an interchange with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate&nbsp;80]] (I-80) and [[New Jersey Route 94|Route&nbsp;94]] in [[Columbia, New Jersey|Columbia]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] on the [[Delaware River]]. The east end is in the middle of the [[George Washington Bridge]] over the [[Hudson River]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] while the route is concurrent with [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]] and [[U.S. Route 1/9|US&nbsp;1-9]]. Throughout much of its length, US&nbsp;46 is closely paralleled by I-80. US&nbsp;46 is a major local and suburban route, with some sections built to or near [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] standards and many other sections [[arterial road|arterials]] with [[jughandle]]s. The route runs through several communities in the northern part of New Jersey, including [[Hackettstown, New Jersey|Hackettstown]], [[Netcong, New Jersey|Netcong]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany-Troy Hills]], [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]], [[Palisades Park, New Jersey|Palisades Park]], and [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]]. It [[List of crossings of the Upper Passaic River|crosses over the Upper Passaic River]] at [[Route 46 Passaic River Bridge|several points]]. The road has been ceremonially named the '''United [[Spanish\u2013American War]] Veterans Memorial Highway'''.<ref name=SLD/>\n\nWhat is now US&nbsp;46 was originally designated as three separate routes. Pre-1927 Route&nbsp;5 was created in 1916 to follow the road from [[Delaware, Warren County, New Jersey|Delaware]] to [[Denville, New Jersey|Denville]], pre-1927 Route&nbsp;12 in 1917 to follow the route between Hackettstown and [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], and [[Pre-1927 Route 10 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route&nbsp;10]] in 1917 to run between Paterson and [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]]. In 1927, '''Route&nbsp;6''' was legislated to run from Delaware east to the George Washington Bridge, replacing portions of Routes&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;12 and paralleling the former Route&nbsp;10, which itself became [[New Jersey Route 5|Route&nbsp;5]] and [[New Jersey Route 10N|Route&nbsp;10N]], the latter being shortly removed from the state highway system. In 1936, US&nbsp;46 was designated to run from [[U.S. Route 611|US&nbsp;611]] in [[Portland, Pennsylvania]] east to the George Washington Bridge. The route replaced [[Pennsylvania Route 987 (1920s)|Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;987]] to the [[Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station|Delaware Bridge]] over the Delaware, and from there followed Route&nbsp;6 across New Jersey. In 1953, the Route&nbsp;6 designation was removed from US&nbsp;46 in New Jersey, and later that year, the route was realigned to end at US&nbsp;611 in Columbia, New Jersey, replacing a part of Route&nbsp;94. US&nbsp;611 had been brought into New Jersey by two new bridges over the Delaware River, following a freeway between them that became a part of I-80. In 1972, US&nbsp;611 was aligned back into its original Pennsylvania route (which from 1953 until US&nbsp;611 decommission was US&nbsp;611 Alternate), and US&nbsp;46's western terminus remained as an interchange ramp with I-80 and Route&nbsp;94.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Warren County===\n[[File:2018-06-28 15 37 30 View west along U.S. Route 46 (Main Street) at Grand Avenue in Hackettstown, Warren County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View west along US&nbsp;46 at Grand Avenue in Hackettstown]]\nUS&nbsp;46 begins at a complex interchange with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] and [[New Jersey Route 94|Route&nbsp;94]] near the [[Portland\u2013Columbia Toll Bridge]] leading to [[Pennsylvania Route 611]] in the community of [[Columbia, New Jersey|Columbia]] in [[Knowlton Township, New Jersey|Knowlton Township]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]]. From this interchange, the route heads southeast along the east bank of the [[Delaware River]] as a four-lane [[dual carriageway|divided highway]] briefly before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. The road passes through wooded mountainous areas before reaching the community of [[Delaware, Warren County, New Jersey|Delaware]]. In Delaware, US&nbsp;46 intersects [[New Jersey Route 163|Route&nbsp;163]], the approach to the former Delaware Bridge, before passing a few commercial establishments. From here, the route continues alongside the river, passing more rural areas of woods and farms with occasional development as it enters [[White Township, New Jersey|White Township]]. US&nbsp;46 makes a sharp turn to the east away from the Delaware River, widening into a four-lane divided highway again as it bypasses the town of [[Belvidere, New Jersey|Belvidere]] and has a few businesses on it. The road turns back into a two-lane undivided road and comes to a crossroads with [[County Route 519 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;519]]. Past this intersection, US 46 continues through rural sectors with some business before coming to the northern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 31|Route&nbsp;31]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google>{{google maps |url=http://www.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=40.928,+-75.094&daddr=US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:Main+St%2FUS-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:US-46+E+to:George+Washington+Bridge&geocode=FQCDcAIdECiG-w%3BFRETbwIdpquH-w%3BFaL-bwIdjkuM-w%3BFerVbwIdcOON-w%3BFfj0bwIdsBCP-w%3BFeTCbwIdqAOQ-w%3BFTyEbwId4vqQ-w%3BFdTDbwIdglSS-w%3BFVbTbwIdqKCT-w%3BFfrUbwIdmq2U-w%3BFQPpbwIdOGiV-w%3BFcZYbwId-JSX-ykjaltFvPbCiTGFpjdhsoDE1Q&hl=en&mra=ls&via=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10&sll=40.854072,-73.985624&sspn=0.029669,0.055189&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=9|title=overview of U.S. Route 46|accessdate=November 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom this point, the route continues east through dense woods prior to turning northeast into [[Liberty Township, New Jersey|Liberty Township]]. The road passes through the community of [[Townsbury, New Jersey|Townsbury]] before crossing into [[Independence Township, New Jersey|Independence Township]]. Here, US&nbsp;46 enters more agricultural areas and turns east again, with development increasing along the road as it passes through [[Great Meadows-Vienna, New Jersey|Great Meadows-Vienna]]. It continues southeast before entering [[Hackettstown, New Jersey|Hackettstown]], where the road becomes Main Street. In Hackettstown, the route crosses [[NJ Transit]]\u2019s [[Morristown Line]] and [[Montclair-Boonton Line]] before coming to an intersection with [[County Route 517 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;517]]. Here, CR&nbsp;517 forms a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with US&nbsp;46, and the two routes continue southeast through the downtown area. At the intersection with the northern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 182|Route&nbsp;182]], CR&nbsp;517 splits from US&nbsp;46 by heading south on that route while US&nbsp;46 continues to the east.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google/>\n\n===Morris and Essex counties===\n[[File:2018-07-30 10 04 40 View west along U.S. Route 46 just west of Hercules Road and Hillside Avenue in Roxbury Township, Morris County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;46 westbound in Roxbury Township]]Shortly after the Route&nbsp;182 intersection, the route crosses the [[Musconetcong River]] into [[Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey|Washington Township]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], where it heads back into rural surroundings. About a mile into Morris County, US&nbsp;46 divides and becomes a four-lane highway with a wide median. The road passes a median [[park and ride]] lot as it turns north and crosses over a mountain. It continues into [[Mount Olive Township, New Jersey|Mount Olive Township]], taking a sharp turn to the east before the road becomes undivided while remaining four lanes. The road passes rural areas and development as it goes through [[Budd Lake, New Jersey|Budd Lake]]. In this community, the route passes to the south of the namesake lake as it begins to turn northeast and then north. The road heads northeast again before it enters [[Netcong, New Jersey|Netcong]] and becomes a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-80/[[U.S. Route 206|US&nbsp;206]]. Within this interchange, the lanes of US&nbsp;46 split. From this point, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through developed areas of Netcong a short distance to the south of NJ Transit's Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. US&nbsp;46 meets [[New Jersey Route 183|Route&nbsp;183]] at an intersection (formerly Netcong Circle) before widening into a four-lane undivided road and leaving Netcong for [[Roxbury Township, New Jersey|Roxbury Township]]. Here, the road passes through wooded areas, meeting I-80 at another interchange and briefly becoming a divided highway at the crossing under I-80 and again at the actual interchange. US&nbsp;46 remains a divided highway with [[jughandle]]s past this point, continuing southeast into the [[Ledgewood, New Jersey|Ledgewood]] area.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google/>\n\nAt a three-way intersection which was formerly [[Ledgewood Circle]], [[New Jersey Route 10|Route&nbsp;10]] begins straight while US&nbsp;46 turns left to continue east as a two-lane undivided road through more development, crossing the [[Dover and Rockaway River Railroad]]'s [[High Bridge Branch]]. Upon crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Chester Branch and passing through [[Succasunna-Kenvil, New Jersey|Kenvil]], the road enters [[Mine Hill Township, New Jersey|Mine Hill Township]], where the road becomes three lanes with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. The route passes through [[Wharton, New Jersey|Wharton]] at its southern tip before continuing into [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]]. US&nbsp;46 narrows back into two lanes, becoming Blackwell Street as it passes St. Clare's Dover General Hospital. The road widens to four lanes as Blackwell Street splits from it at an eastbound exit and westbound entrance prior to a bridge over the [[Rockaway River]] and NJ Transit's Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. A short distance later, US&nbsp;46 intersects the southern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]] and passes over the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Dover and Rockaway Branch. From here, the route continues on McFarland Street. US&nbsp;46 continues east, entering [[Rockaway Township, New Jersey|Rockaway Township]], where there is an intersection with [[County Route 513 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;513]]. Past CR&nbsp;513, the road narrows to two lanes as it heads northeast through [[Rockaway, New Jersey|Rockaway Borough]] before turning east and crossing the Rockaway River and the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Dover and Rockaway Branch. The route continues northeast, entering wooded residential areas as it heads into [[Denville, New Jersey|Denville]] and has a limited interchange with I-80, where it can only be entered to and from the westbound lane and where US&nbsp;46 east can only be entered from the eastbound lane and to the eastbound lane. As it crosses under I-80, US&nbsp;46 becomes a six-lane divided highway.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google/>\n\n[[File:2018-07-30 09 07 25 View west along U.S. Route 46 just west of Chapin Road in Montville Township, Morris County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|US&nbsp;46 westbound past Route&nbsp;159 in Montville Township]]\nThe road is lined with a moderate number of businesses, most with [[right-in/right-out]] (RIRO) access, as it continues southeast through Denville, narrowing to four lanes before coming to an interchange with [[New Jersey Route 53|Route&nbsp;53]].  From this interchange, the route continues east before curving southeast and entering [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey|Mountain Lakes]]. In Mountain Lakes, US&nbsp;46 crosses under the Montclair-Boonton Line before continuing into [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany-Troy Hills]]. Here, the road comes to [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;202]]/[[County Route 511 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;511]] before passing under [[Interstate 287|I-287]]. At this point, the westbound direction of US&nbsp;46 has a ramp to northbound I-287, with access to and from southbound I-287 provided by US&nbsp;202. Past the I-287 crossing, the road comes to another partial interchange with I-80 near the western terminus of [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|I-280]]. Past this interchange, US&nbsp;46 widens to six lanes and enters [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]]. In Montville, the route narrows back to four lanes, and has traffic light-controlled intersections with New Road and Hook Mountain Road/Chapin Road. It then has an interchange with [[New Jersey Route 159|Route&nbsp;159]] and makes a turn to the northeast. Upon [[Route 46 Passaic River Bridge|crossing the Passaic River]] at [[Pine Brook, Morris County, New Jersey|Pine Brook]], US&nbsp;46 enters Essex County into [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield Township]]. A short distance into Essex County, US&nbsp;46 has another interchange with Route&nbsp;159 (Clinton Road), providing access to that route and to its continuation as [[List of county routes in Essex County, New Jersey|CR 627]] (Plymouth Street). Shortly farther along US&nbsp;46, Route&nbsp;159 and CR&nbsp;627 meet it at a traffic light-controlled intersection, providing cross-traffic and turns onto US&nbsp;46. Past this point, US&nbsp;46 remains a surface road with RIRO-accessed driveways, but has several intersections controlled by interchanges. Within Fairfield, US&nbsp;46 has interchanges with Hollywood Avenue and Passaic Avenue as well as two [[trumpet interchange]]s providing access to Fairfield Road, which runs a short distance to the south of US&nbsp;46.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google/>\n\n===Passaic County===\n[[File:US 46 EB at Passaic CR 640 exit.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;46 eastbound at exit for CR&nbsp;640 in Totowa]]\nThe route crosses the Passaic River again into [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]] in [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google/> The median splits as the road passes to the north of the [[Willowbrook Mall (Wayne, New Jersey)|Willowbrook Mall]], with an exit serving the mall, before reaching the Spaghetti Bowl interchange with partial access to I-80 and full access to [[New Jersey Route 23|Route&nbsp;23]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=Google/><ref name=pvt>{{cite news |last=Boud|first=Tom|title=Spaghetti Bowl project complete|publisher=Passaic Valley Today|date=September 15, 2008}}</ref> Within this interchange, US&nbsp;46 passes under the Montclair-Boonton Line again. From here, it passes businesses and many shopping centers with RIRO access as a six-lane highway, heading into [[Totowa, New Jersey|Totowa]]. In this area, the route has interchanges with CR&nbsp;640 and [[New Jersey Route 62|Route&nbsp;62]]/CR&nbsp;646. The road turns southeast, crossing the Passaic River a third time into [[Little Falls, New Jersey|Little Falls]]. At this point, US&nbsp;46 runs along the Little Falls/[[Woodland Park, New Jersey|Woodland Park]] border, interchanging CR&nbsp;639 and Browertown Road. After the exit for Lower Notch Road, the route enters more wooded surroundings, interchanging with Notch Road/Rifle Camp Road before entering [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]]. Upon reaching Clifton, US&nbsp;46 has an interchange with the western terminus of [[New Jersey Route 3|Route&nbsp;3]] and Valley Road (CR&nbsp;621), with the Valley Road exit stitched into the Route&nbsp;3 side of the highway fork.<ref name=SLD/> Prior to reconstruction of the interchanges, the Valley Road ramp exited before Route&nbsp;3 began, and Route&nbsp;3 branched off immediately after Valley Road.<ref name=Google/>\n\nPast Route&nbsp;3, the highway narrows to four lanes, continuing east-northeast as a limited-access divided highway with some RIRO-accessed businesses still on it, though many roads are accessed through over and underpasses. US&nbsp;46 has an exit for Van Houten Avenue/Grove Street before coming to a large interchange with [[New Jersey Route 19|Route&nbsp;19]]/[[County Route 509 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;509]] and the [[Garden State Parkway]]. After this, the road passes over [[Norfolk Southern]]'s Newark Industrial Track line and NJ Transit's [[Main Line (NJ Transit)|Main Line]] and has an exit for Hazel Street/Paulison Avenue. After the exit, US&nbsp;46 begins a brief concurrence with Piaget Avenue in Clifton with a series of connector streets and three intersections controlled by stoplights. After the third, at Day Street near Christopher Columbus Middle School, the two roads split at a fork, marked as an exit, with US&nbsp;46 continuing eastbound to the left and Piaget Avenue continuing to the right.

Immediately after the river, the route has an interchange for [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;507]]. Passing through more RIRO-accessed business areas, the road narrows to four lanes and has a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Past the parkway, US&nbsp;46 continues as a road with some jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections (but still largely maintaining RIRO access to driveways and side streets), crossing [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway]]'s Dundee Branch line and passing through a small corner of [[Garfield, New Jersey|Garfield]] before crossing into [[Saddle Brook, New Jersey|Saddle Brook]].

The road continues into [[Little Ferry, New Jersey|Little Ferry]], where it passes suburban residential and commercial areas and narrows into a four-lane undivided road called Sylvan Avenue, turning to the east and crossing [[County Route 503 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;503]]. After intersecting the [[Bergen Turnpike]] at the modified [[Little Ferry Circle]], which US&nbsp;46 runs through, the route crosses the [[Hackensack River]] into [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]] on the [[Route&nbsp;46 Hackensack River Bridge]], passing over New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's New Jersey Subdivision line and [[CSX]]'s [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|River Subdivision]] line before the bridge ends. In Ridgefield Park, the route is called Winant Avenue and becomes a four-lane divided highway before briefly becoming undivided again. Upon turning back into a divided highway, US 46 comes to a large interchange with [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]/[[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Past this interchange, the route widens to six lanes and crosses the [[Overpeck Creek]] into [[Ridgefield, New Jersey|Ridgefield]], where it passes over CSX's [[Northern Running Track]] line.

The Dover Turnpike was chartered in 1813 to run west from the Union Turnpike in Dover to the Morris Turnpike.

The first route was pre-1927 Route&nbsp;5, which was first legislated in 1916. It began by crossing the Delaware River from Pennsylvania at the community of Delaware. Several undercrossings of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] near Delaware were bypassed with a short new road on the southwest side of the railroad. From there, Route&nbsp;5 used the existing Delaware Road to north of Belvidere, then the Buttzville-Belvidere Road to [[Buttzville, New Jersey|Buttzville]], the Buttzville Road to [[Great Meadows, New Jersey|Great Meadows]], and the Danville Mountain Road to Hackettstown.<ref name=1916report>{{cite book|title=Annual Report|publisher=New Jersey State Highway Department|date=1916}}</ref>\n\nFrom Hackettstown to Denville, Route&nbsp;5 ran concurrently with pre-1927 Route&nbsp;12, which was first legislated in 1917.<ref name=ttmap>{{cite map |url=http://www.jimmyandsharonwilliams.com/njroads/1920s/maps/1927tt1.jpg |title=Map of New Jersey|year=1927|publisher=Tydol Trails|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref><ref name=1917report>{{cite book|title=Annual Report|publisher=New Jersey State Highway Department|date=1917}}</ref> A mostly-new road (now eastbound US&nbsp;46) was built from Hackettstown east to Netcong to avoid steep [[grade (slope)|grades]] on the existing roads. Portions of the existing Budd's Lake Road were used between Budd Lake and Netcong. From Netcong the route used the old [[Morris Turnpike]] to Ledgewood and the [[Dover Turnpike]] to Dover, running into Dover on Blackwell Street. Blackwell Street led to Rockaway Road, becoming Main Street in Rockaway, from which it used the old [[Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike]] to Denville.<ref name=1916report/>\n\nAt Denville, Route&nbsp;5 turned south, while Route&nbsp;12 continued east along the Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to [[Pine Brook, Morris County, New Jersey|Pine Brook]].<ref name=ttmap/> The route left the old turnpike there to head northeast towards Paterson, starting with the Pine Brook Road (now Fairfield Road and Little Falls Road) to Little Falls. A bypass was planned around the south side of Little Falls, taking it under the [[Erie Railroad]] at Union Boulevard. From there Route&nbsp;12 would use Union Boulevard, Totowa Road and McBride Avenue into Paterson. [[Pre-1927 Route 10 (New Jersey)|Pre-1927 Route&nbsp;10]], which was legislated in 1917, continued east on Market Street on the other side of Paterson to [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]], where it connected to the Fort Lee Ferry across the [[Hudson River]].

The west end is at an interchange with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate&nbsp;80]] (I-80) and [[New Jersey Route 94|Route&nbsp;94]] in [[Columbia, New Jersey|Columbia]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] on the [[Delaware River]]. The east end is in the middle of the [[George Washington Bridge]] over the [[Hudson River]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] while the route is concurrent with [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]] and [[U.S. Route 1/9|US&nbsp;1-9]]. Throughout much of its length, US&nbsp;46 is closely paralleled by I-80. US&nbsp;46 is a major local and suburban route, with some sections built to or near [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] standards and many other sections [[arterial road|arterials]] with [[jughandle]]s. The route runs through several communities in the northern part of New Jersey, including [[Hackettstown, New Jersey|Hackettstown]], [[Netcong, New Jersey|Netcong]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany-Troy Hills]], [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]], [[Palisades Park, New Jersey|Palisades Park]], and [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]]. It [[List of crossings of the Upper Passaic River|crosses over the Upper Passaic River]] at [[Route 46 Passaic River Bridge|several points]]. The road has been ceremonially named the '''United [[Spanish\u2013American War]] Veterans Memorial Highway'''.<ref name=SLD/>\n\nWhat is now US&nbsp;46 was originally designated as three separate routes. Pre-1927 Route&nbsp;5 was created in 1916 to follow the road from [[Delaware, Warren County, New Jersey|Delaware]] to [[Denville, New Jersey|Denville]], pre-1927 Route&nbsp;12 in 1917 to follow the route between Hackettstown and [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], and [[Pre-1927 Route 10 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route&nbsp;10]] in 1917 to run between Paterson and [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]]. In 1927, '''Route&nbsp;6''' was legislated to run from Delaware east to the George Washington Bridge, replacing portions of Routes&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;12 and paralleling the former Route&nbsp;10, which itself became [[New Jersey Route 5|Route&nbsp;5]] and [[New Jersey Route 10N|Route&nbsp;10N]], the latter being shortly removed from the state highway system. In 1936, US&nbsp;46 was designated to run from [[U.S. Route 611|US&nbsp;611]] in [[Portland, Pennsylvania]] east to the George Washington Bridge. The route replaced [[Pennsylvania Route 987 (1920s)|Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;987]] to the [[Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station|Delaware Bridge]] over the Delaware, and from there followed Route&nbsp;6 across New Jersey. In 1953, the Route&nbsp;6 designation was removed from US&nbsp;46 in New Jersey, and later that year, the route was realigned to end at US&nbsp;611 in Columbia, New Jersey, replacing a part of Route&nbsp;94. US&nbsp;611 had been brought into New Jersey by two new bridges over the Delaware River, following a freeway between them that became a part of I-80. In 1972, US&nbsp;611 was aligned back into its original Pennsylvania route (which from 1953 until US&nbsp;611 decommission was US&nbsp;611 Alternate), and US&nbsp;46's western terminus remained as an interchange ramp with I-80 and Route&nbsp;94.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Warren County===\n[[File:2018-06-28 15 37 30 View west along U.S. Route 46 (Main Street) at Grand Avenue in Hackettstown, Warren County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View west along US&nbsp;46 at Grand Avenue in Hackettstown]]\nUS&nbsp;46 begins at a complex interchange with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] and [[New Jersey Route 94|Route&nbsp;94]] near the [[Portland\u2013Columbia Toll Bridge]] leading to [[Pennsylvania Route 611]] in the community of [[Columbia, New Jersey|Columbia]] in [[Knowlton Township, New Jersey|Knowlton Township]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]]. From this interchange, the route heads southeast along the east bank of the [[Delaware River]] as a four-lane [[dual carriageway|divided highway]] briefly before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. The road passes through wooded mountainous areas before reaching the community of [[Delaware, Warren County, New Jersey|Delaware]]. In Delaware, US&nbsp;46 intersects [[New Jersey Route 163|Route&nbsp;163]], the approach to the former Delaware Bridge, before passing a few commercial establishments. From here, the route continues alongside the river, passing more rural areas of woods and farms with occasional development as it enters [[White Township, New Jersey|White Township]]. US&nbsp;46 makes a sharp turn to the east away from the Delaware River, widening into a four-lane divided highway again as it bypasses the town of [[Belvidere, New Jersey|Belvidere]] and has a few businesses on it.

It continues into [[Mount Olive Township, New Jersey|Mount Olive Township]], taking a sharp turn to the east before the road becomes undivided while remaining four lanes. The road passes rural areas and development as it goes through [[Budd Lake, New Jersey|Budd Lake]]. In this community, the route passes to the south of the namesake lake as it begins to turn northeast and then north. The road heads northeast again before it enters [[Netcong, New Jersey|Netcong]] and becomes a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-80/[[U.S. Route 206|US&nbsp;206]]. Within this interchange, the lanes of US&nbsp;46 split. From this point, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through developed areas of Netcong a short distance to the south of NJ Transit's Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. US&nbsp;46 meets [[New Jersey Route 183|Route&nbsp;183]] at an intersection (formerly Netcong Circle) before widening into a four-lane undivided road and leaving Netcong for [[Roxbury Township, New Jersey|Roxbury Township]]. Here, the road passes through wooded areas, meeting I-80 at another interchange and briefly becoming a divided highway at the crossing under I-80 and again at the actual interchange.

Upon crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Chester Branch and passing through [[Succasunna-Kenvil, New Jersey|Kenvil]], the road enters [[Mine Hill Township, New Jersey|Mine Hill Township]], where the road becomes three lanes with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. The route passes through [[Wharton, New Jersey|Wharton]] at its southern tip before continuing into [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]]. US&nbsp;46 narrows back into two lanes, becoming Blackwell Street as it passes St. Clare's Dover General Hospital. The road widens to four lanes as Blackwell Street splits from it at an eastbound exit and westbound entrance prior to a bridge over the [[Rockaway River]] and NJ Transit's Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. A short distance later, US&nbsp;46 intersects the southern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]] and passes over the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Dover and Rockaway Branch. From here, the route continues on McFarland Street. US&nbsp;46 continues east, entering [[Rockaway Township, New Jersey|Rockaway Township]], where there is an intersection with [[County Route 513 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;513]]. Past CR&nbsp;513, the road narrows to two lanes as it heads northeast through [[Rockaway, New Jersey|Rockaway Borough]] before turning east and crossing the Rockaway River and the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad's Dover and Rockaway Branch. The route continues northeast, entering wooded residential areas as it heads into [[Denville, New Jersey|Denville]] and has a limited interchange with I-80, where it can only be entered to and from the westbound lane and where US&nbsp;46 east can only be entered from the eastbound lane and to the eastbound lane.

From this interchange, the route continues east before curving southeast and entering [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey|Mountain Lakes]]. In Mountain Lakes, US&nbsp;46 crosses under the Montclair-Boonton Line before continuing into [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany-Troy Hills]]. Here, the road comes to [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;202]]/[[County Route 511 (New Jersey)|CR&nbsp;511]] before passing under [[Interstate 287|I-287]]. At this point, the westbound direction of US&nbsp;46 has a ramp to northbound I-287, with access to and from southbound I-287 provided by US&nbsp;202. Past the I-287 crossing, the road comes to another partial interchange with I-80 near the western terminus of [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|I-280]]. Past this interchange, US&nbsp;46 widens to six lanes and enters [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]]. In Montville, the route narrows back to four lanes, and has traffic light-controlled intersections with New Road and Hook Mountain Road/Chapin Road. It then has an interchange with [[New Jersey Route 159|Route&nbsp;159]] and makes a turn to the northeast. Upon [[Route 46 Passaic River Bridge|crossing the Passaic River]] at [[Pine Brook, Morris County, New Jersey|Pine Brook]], US&nbsp;46 enters Essex County into [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield Township]]. A short distance into Essex County, US&nbsp;46 has another interchange with Route&nbsp;159 (Clinton Road), providing access to that route and to its continuation as [[List of county routes in Essex County, New Jersey|CR 627]] (Plymouth Street). Shortly farther along US&nbsp;46, Route&nbsp;159 and CR&nbsp;627 meet it at a traffic light-controlled intersection, providing cross-traffic and turns onto US&nbsp;46. Past this point, US&nbsp;46 remains a surface road with RIRO-accessed driveways, but has several intersections controlled by interchanges.

As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The quarantines are happening in hotels designated by the government in Entebbe, about an hour from Kampala, but will be paid for by the citizens themselves. Since the mandatory quarantine began, about 40 travelers have been forced to pay up to US$840 to stay in the Central Inn hotel, a cost that is excessive for most Ugandans. Witnesses have said that people unable to pay the hotel fees have been forced to sleep in the lobby of the hotel, while others have been stranded at the airport. It is also not clear if the government is upholding basic health standards in the hotel quarantines. Travelers forced to stay in the hotel are reportedly forced to stay in close proximity to each other and the hotel staff, with some unable even to take a shower. One person posted on Facebook that no medical officer has visited the hotel and that staff have frequently entered and left the premises and worked without protective gear.

Since the mandatory quarantine began, about 40 travelers have been forced to pay up to US$840 to stay in the Central Inn hotel, a cost that is excessive for most Ugandans.

Travelers forced to stay in the hotel are reportedly forced to stay in close proximity to each other and the hotel staff, with some unable even to take a shower. One person posted on Facebook that no medical officer has visited the hotel and that staff have frequently entered and left the premises and worked without protective gear.

{"title_page": "White Kennett", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n[[Image:WhiteKennett.jpg|thumb|Bishop Kennett.]]\n'''White Kennett''' (10 August 1660{{snd}}19 December 1728) was an English bishop and [[antiquarian]]. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], where, while an undergraduate, he published several translations of [[Latin]] works, including [[Erasmus]]' ''[[In Praise of Folly]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nKennett was [[vicar]] of [[Ambrosden]], Oxfordshire from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, where he gave considerable impetus to the study of antiquities. [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] gave him lessons in [[Old English]]. In 1695 he published ''Parochial Antiquities''. In 1700 he became rector of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]], London, and in 1701 [[List of Archdeacons of Huntingdon|Archdeacon of Huntingdon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFor a eulogistic [[sermon]] on the recently deceased [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], Kennett was in 1707 recommended to the [[List of deans of Peterborough#18th century|deanery of Peterborough]]. He afterwards joined the Low Church party, strenuously opposed the [[Henry Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] movement, and in the [[Bangorian controversy]] supported with great zeal and considerable bitterness the side of [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. His intimacy with [[Charles Trimnell]], [[bishop of Norwich]], who was high in favour with [[George I of Great Britain]], secured for him in 1718 the [[bishopric of Peterborough]]. He died at Westminster in December 1728. White Kennett Street, near St Botolph, Aldgate, is named after him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Biography==\nWhite Kennett was born in the parish of St Mary, Dover, on 10 August 1660, the son of Basil Kennett, M.A., rector of Dimchurch and vicar of Postling, Kent, by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas White, a wealthy magistrate and master-shipwright of Dover. After receiving a preliminary education at Elham and Wye, he was placed at Westminster 'above the curtain,' or in the upper school; but as he was suffering from smallpox at the period of the election of scholars on the foundation, his father recalled him home. After his recovery he spent a year at Beaksbourne, in the family of Mr. Tolson, whose three sons he taught 'with great content and success.'<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kennett, White|volume=31}}</ref> He was the older brother of [[Basil Kennett]], whose life and career he was considerably to influence.\n\nHe was entered a batler or semi-commoner of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in June 1678, being placed under the tuition of [[Andrew Allam]]. According to [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Hearne]] he 'sometimes waited on Dr. Wallis to church with his skarlett,' and performed other menial offices, but, on the other hand, he associated with the gentlemen-commoners. While an undergraduate he began his career as a writer by publishing anonymously, just before the assembling of parliament at Oxford on 21 March 1680\u20131, ''A Letter from a Student at Oxford to a Friend in the Country, concerning the approaching Parliament, in vindication of his Majesty, the Church of England, and the University''. The whig party endeavoured to discover the author, with a view to his punishment, but the sudden dissolution of the parliament put an end to the incident and occasioned the publication of Kennett's second piece, ''A Poem to Mr. E. L. on his Majesty's dissolving the late Parliament at Oxford'', 28 March 1681.\n\nAbout this period Kennett was introduced to [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], who employed him in collecting epitaphs and notices of eminent Oxford men. In his diary, 2 March 1681\u20132, Wood notes that he had directed five shillings to be given to Kennett \"for pains he hath taken for me in Kent\". On 2 May 1682 Kennett graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]], and next year published a version of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus's]] [[In Praise of Folly|''The Praise of Folly|Mori\u00e6 Encomium'']], under the title of ''Wit against Wisdom: or a Panegyric upon Folly'', 1683, 8vo. In the following year he contributed the life of [[Chabrias]] to the edition of [[Cornelius Nepos]], \"done into English by several hands\". He commenced [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] on 22 January 1684, and having taken holy orders he became curate and assistant to Samuel Blackwell, B.D., vicar and schoolmaster of Bicester, Oxfordshire. [[Sir William Glynne, 1st Baronet|Sir William Glynne]] presented him in September 1685 to the neighbouring vicarage of [[Ambrosden]]. Soon afterwards he published ''An Address of Thanks to a good Prince; presented in the Panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan, the best of Roman Emperors'', London, 1686, 8vo, with a high-flown preface expressing his loyalty to the throne.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Political views===\nKennett's political views were quickly modified by dislike of the ecclesiastical policy of [[James II of England|James II]]. He preached a series of discourses against \"popery\", refused to read the 'Declaration for Liberty of Conscience' in 1688, and acted with the majority of the clergy in the diocese of Oxford when they rejected an address to the king recommended by Bishop Parker. Hearne relates that at the beginning of the [[Glorious Revolution]] Kennett lent Dodwell a manuscript treatise, composed by himself and never printed, offering arguments for taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to William and Mary. Subsequently, Kennett openly supported the cause of the revolution, and thereby exposed himself to much obloquy from his former friends, who called him 'Weathercock Kennett'. In January 1689, while shooting at Middleton Stoney, his gun burst and fractured his skull. The operation of trepanning was successfully performed, but he was obliged to wear a large black patch of velvet on his forehead during the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAfter a few years' absence at Ambrosden he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], and in September 1691 was chosen lecturer of [[Carfax, Oxford|St Martin's, commonly called Carfax, Oxford]]. He was also appointed a public lecturer in the schools, and filled the office of pro-proctor for two successive years. He proceeded [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] on 5 May 1694. In February 1694\u20135 he was presented by William Cherry to the rectory of [[Shottesbrooke]], Berkshire. He was created [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] at Oxford on 19 July 1700, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]]. He resigned the vicarage of Ambrosden, and did not obtain possession of St Botolph's without a lawsuit. On 15 February 1701 he was installed in the [[Prebendary|prebend]] of Combe and Harnham, in the church of Salisbury.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Antiquarian reputation===\nKennett's historical and antiquarian researches had meanwhile procured him some reputation. From [[George Hickes (divine)|Dr George Hickes]] (afterwards [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] bishop of Thetford), who lived for a time in seclusion with him at Ambrosden, he received instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and other northern tongues. For several years the two scholars were on the most friendly terms, but eventually there was an open rupture between them, owing to religious and political differences. Kennett contributed a life of [[William Somner]] to the [[James Brome]]'s edition of that antiquary's ''Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent'' (1693), and the biography was enlarged and reissued in Somner's ''Treatise of Gavelkind'', 2nd edition 1726. His reputation as a [[Topography|topographer]] and [[Philology|philologist]] was enhanced by his ''Parochial Antiquities attempted in the History of Ambrosden, Burcester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks, with a Glossary of Obsolete Terms'', Oxford, 1695, 4to, dedicated to his patron, Sir W. Glynne. A new edition, greatly enlarged from the author's manuscript notes, was issued at Oxford (2 vols. 1818, 4to) under the editorship of [[Bulkeley Bandinel]]. While engaged on this work the question of lay impropriations had come much under his notice, and he published \"for the terror of evil-doers\" the ''History and Fate of Sacrilege, discovered by examples of Scripture, of Heathens, of Christians'', London, 1698, 8vo, written by [[Henry Spelman|Sir Henry Spelman]] in 1632, but omitted from the edition of that author's ''Posthumous Works''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Chaplain to Bishop Gardiner===\nKennett was now chaplain to [[James Gardiner (bishop)|Bishop Gardiner of Lincoln]], and on 15 May 1701 became archdeacon of Huntingdon. Thereupon he entered into a controversy with [[Francis Atterbury]] about the rights of [[Convocation]], and ably supported [[William Wake|Dr Wake]] and [[Edmund Gibson]] in their contention that convocation had few inherent rights of independent action. In Warburton's view, Kennett's arguments were based on precedents, while Atterbury's rested on principles. On [[Thomas Tenison|Archbishop Tenison's]] recommendation he was appointed in 1701 one of the original members of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]]. In a sermon preached in his parish church of Aldgate on 31 January 1703\u20134, the fast day for the martyrdom of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], Kennett acknowledged that there had been some errors in his reign, owing to a 'popish' queen and a corrupt ministry, whose policy tended in the direction of an absolute tyranny. To correct exaggerated statements made about this sermon, Kennett printed it under the title of ''A Compassionate Enquiry into the Causes of the Civil War'', London (three editions), 1704, 4to. It elicited many angry replies from his high-church opponents.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1704 he published ''The Case of Impropriations, and of the Augmentation of Vicarages, and other insufficient Cures, stated by History and Law, from the first Usurpations of the Popes and Monks, to her Majesty's Royal Bounty lately extended to the poorer Clergy of the Church of England''. A copy of this work, bound in two vols., with copious additions by the author, was formerly in the possession of [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]], and is now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. In 1705 some booksellers undertook a collection of the best works on English history down to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and induced Kennett to write a continuation to the time of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Although it appeared anonymously as the third volume of the ''Compleat History of England'', 1706, fol., the author's name soon became known, and he was exposed to renewed attacks from his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] enemies. A new edition, with corrections, was published in 1719, but it was not until 1740 that there appeared [[Roger North (biographer)|Roger North's]] ''Examen, or an Inquiry into the Credit and Veracity of a pretended Complete History, viz. Dr. White Kennett's \"History of England\"''. His popularity at court was increased by the published denunciations of his views, and he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to her majesty. He was installed in the deanery of Peterborough 21 February 1707\u20138. A few days previously he had been collated to the prebend of Marston St Laurence, in the church of Lincoln.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA sermon which he preached at the funeral of the first [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] on 5 September 1707, and which laid him open to the charge of encouraging a deathbed repentance, was published by Henry Hills, without a dedication, in 1707. To a second edition, published by John Churchill in 1708, with a dedication to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire|William, second duke of Devonshire]], was appended ''Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish'', a separate edition of which was published by Hills in the same year. A new edition of the sermon, with the author's manuscript corrections, was published by [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] in 1797, but very few copies were sold, and the remainder were destroyed by fire. The imputation against Kennett was fresh in the memory of [[Alexander Pope]] when in the ''[[An Essay on Criticism|Essay on Criticism]]'' he wrote:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n:''Then unbelieving priests reformed the nation,''\n:''And taught more pleasing methods of salvation''\n\nKennett's subsequent preferment was naturally connected by his enemies with the strain of adulatory reference to the second duke with which the sermon concludes.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===St Mary Aldermary, London===\nIn 1707, desiring more leisure for study, he resigned the rectory of St Botolph, Aldgate, and obtained the less remunerative rectory of [[St Mary Aldermary]], London. During this period he published numerous sermons, and his pen was actively engaged in support of his party. He zealously opposed the doctrine of the invalidity of lay baptism, and his answer to [[Henry Sacheverell]]'s sermon preached before the lord mayor on 5 November 1709 raised a storm of indignation. In 1710 he was severely censured for not joining in the congratulatory address of the London clergy to the queen, which was drawn up on the accession of the tories to office after Sacheverell's trial. Kennett and others who declined to subscribe it were represented as enemies to the crown and ministry.\n\n[[Richard Welton]], rector of [[St Mary Matfelon]], Whitechapel, introduced into an altar-piece in his church a portrait of Kennett to represent [[Judas Iscariot]]. It was stated that the rector had caused Kennett's figure to be substituted for that of [[Gilbert Burnet]] at the suggestion of the painter, who feared an action of [[Privilege of peerage#Scandalum magnatum|''scandalum magnatum'']] if Burnet were introduced. A print of the picture in the library of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] is accompanied with these manuscript lines by [[Michel Maittaire]]:\n\n:''To say the picture does to him belong,''\n:''Kennett does Judas and the Painter wrong.''\n:''False is the image, the resemblance faint:''\n:''Judas compared to Kennett is a Saint.''\n\nMultitudes of people visited the church daily to see the painting, but [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], bishop of London, soon ordered its removal. For many years afterwards it is said to have ornamented the high altar at [[St Albans Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Society for the Propagation of the Gospel===\nTo advance the interests of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Kennett made a collection of books, charts, maps, and documents, with the intention of composing a ''History of the Propagation of Christianity in the English-American Colonies'', and on the relinquishment of that project he presented his collections to the corporation, and printed a catalogue entitled ''Bibliothec\u00e6 American\u00e6 Primordia'', London, 1713, 4to, afterwards republished with additions by [[Henry Homer the elder]], 1789, 4to. He also founded an antiquarian and historical library at Peterborough, and enriched the library of that church with some scarce books, including an abstract of the manuscript collections made by Dr John Cosens, bishop of that see, and a copiously annotated copy of [[Simon Gunton|Gunton's]] ''History of Peterborough''. The collection, consisting of about fifteen hundred books and tracts, was placed in a private room at Peterborough, and a manuscript catalogue was drawn up and subscribed ''Index librorum aliquot vetustorum quos in commune bonum congessit W. K., Decan. Petriburg. MDCCXII''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Bishop of Peterborough===\nOn 25 July 1713 Kennett was installed prebendary of Farrendon-cum-Balderton at Lincoln. He preached vehemently against the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], and in the two following years warmly advocated the repeal of the acts against occasional conformity. In the [[Bangorian controversy]] he opposed the proceedings of convocation against [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. By the influence of his friend [[Charles Trimnell|Dr Charles Trimnell]], bishop of Norwich and afterwards of Winchester, he was appointed bishop of Peterborough; he was consecrated at [[Lambeth Palace|Lambeth]] on 9 November 1718, and had permission to hold the archdeaconry of Huntingdon and a prebend in Salisbury in commendam. He died ten years later at his house in [[St James's Street]] Westminster, on 19 December 1728. He was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]], where a marble monument with a brief Latin inscription was erected to his memory.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Family===\nHe married first, on 6 June 1693, Sarah, only daughter of Robert and Mary Carver of Bicester (she died on 2 March 1693\u20134, sine prole); secondly, on 6 June 1695, Sarah, sister of Richard Smith, M.D., of London and Aylesbury (she died in August 1702); thirdly, in 1703, Dorcas, daughter of Thomas Fuller, D.D., rector of Wellinghale, Essex, and widow of Clopton Havers, M.D. (she died 9 July 1743). His second wife bore him a son, White Kennett, rector of Burton-le-Coggles, Lincolnshire, and prebendary of Peterborough, Lincoln, and London, who died on 6 May 1740; and a daughter Sarah, who married John Newman of Shottesbrook, Berkshire, and died on 22 February 1756. Hearne, writing on 26 April 1707, says that Kennett's 'present [his third] wife wears the breeches, as his haughty, insolent temper deserves'.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Character===\nHis biographer, the Rev. William Newton, admits that his zeal as a whig partisan sometimes carried him to extremes, but he was very charitable, and displayed great moderation in his relations with the dissenters. He is now remembered chiefly as a painstaking and laborious antiquary, especially in the department of ecclesiastical biography. The number of his works both in print and manuscript shows him to have been throughout his life a man of incredible diligence and application. He was always ready to communicate the results of his researches to fellow-students.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{abbreviations|section|cf. to. q.v. &c. etcetera|date=January 2015}}\n{{citation style|section|date=January 2015}}\n\nProbably his best-known work, apart from his ''Compleat History'', was his ''Register and Chronicle, Ecclesiastical and Civil: containing Matters of Fact delivered in the words of the most Authentick Books, Papers, and Records; digested in exact order of time. With papers, notes, and references towards discovering and connecting the true History of England from the Restauration of King Charles II'', vol. i. London, 1728, fol. The original materials for this valuable work are preserved in the [[British Museum]] among the [[Lansdowne manuscripts]]. 1002\u20131010. The manuscript volumes bring the register to 1679. The published volume begins with the Restoration, and only comes down to December 1662.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nKennett published more than twelve separate sermons preached on public occasions between 1694 and 1728, and others in support of charity schools (cf. ''The Excellent Daughter'', 1708; 11th edit. 1807) or of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (cf. sermon issued in 1712). His addresses to his clergy at Peterborough on his first visitation were issued in 1720.

He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], where, while an undergraduate, he published several translations of [[Latin]] works, including [[Erasmus]]' ''[[In Praise of Folly]]''.\n\nKennett was [[vicar]] of [[Ambrosden]], Oxfordshire from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, where he gave considerable impetus to the study of antiquities. [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] gave him lessons in [[Old English]]. In 1695 he published ''Parochial Antiquities''. In 1700 he became rector of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]], London, and in 1701 [[List of Archdeacons of Huntingdon|Archdeacon of Huntingdon]].\n\nFor a eulogistic [[sermon]] on the recently deceased [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], Kennett was in 1707 recommended to the [[List of deans of Peterborough#18th century|deanery of Peterborough]]. He afterwards joined the Low Church party, strenuously opposed the [[Henry Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] movement, and in the [[Bangorian controversy]] supported with great zeal and considerable bitterness the side of [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. His intimacy with [[Charles Trimnell]], [[bishop of Norwich]], who was high in favour with [[George I of Great Britain]], secured for him in 1718 the [[bishopric of Peterborough]]. He died at Westminster in December 1728. White Kennett Street, near St Botolph, Aldgate, is named after him.\n\n==Biography==\nWhite Kennett was born in the parish of St Mary, Dover, on 10 August 1660, the son of Basil Kennett, M.A., rector of Dimchurch and vicar of Postling, Kent, by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas White, a wealthy magistrate and master-shipwright of Dover. After receiving a preliminary education at Elham and Wye, he was placed at Westminster 'above the curtain,' or in the upper school; but as he was suffering from smallpox at the period of the election of scholars on the foundation, his father recalled him home. After his recovery he spent a year at Beaksbourne, in the family of Mr. Tolson, whose three sons he taught 'with great content and success.'<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kennett, White|volume=31}}</ref> He was the older brother of [[Basil Kennett]], whose life and career he was considerably to influence.\n\nHe was entered a batler or semi-commoner of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in June 1678, being placed under the tuition of [[Andrew Allam]]. According to [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Hearne]] he 'sometimes waited on Dr. Wallis to church with his skarlett,' and performed other menial offices, but, on the other hand, he associated with the gentlemen-commoners. While an undergraduate he began his career as a writer by publishing anonymously, just before the assembling of parliament at Oxford on 21 March 1680\u20131, ''A Letter from a Student at Oxford to a Friend in the Country, concerning the approaching Parliament, in vindication of his Majesty, the Church of England, and the University''. The whig party endeavoured to discover the author, with a view to his punishment, but the sudden dissolution of the parliament put an end to the incident and occasioned the publication of Kennett's second piece, ''A Poem to Mr. E. L. on his Majesty's dissolving the late Parliament at Oxford'', 28 March 1681.\n\nAbout this period Kennett was introduced to [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], who employed him in collecting epitaphs and notices of eminent Oxford men. In his diary, 2 March 1681\u20132, Wood notes that he had directed five shillings to be given to Kennett \"for pains he hath taken for me in Kent\". On 2 May 1682 Kennett graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]], and next year published a version of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus's]] [[In Praise of Folly|''The Praise of Folly|Mori\u00e6 Encomium'']], under the title of ''Wit against Wisdom: or a Panegyric upon Folly'', 1683, 8vo. In the following year he contributed the life of [[Chabrias]] to the edition of [[Cornelius Nepos]], \"done into English by several hands\". He commenced [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] on 22 January 1684, and having taken holy orders he became curate and assistant to Samuel Blackwell, B.D., vicar and schoolmaster of Bicester, Oxfordshire. [[Sir William Glynne, 1st Baronet|Sir William Glynne]] presented him in September 1685 to the neighbouring vicarage of [[Ambrosden]]. Soon afterwards he published ''An Address of Thanks to a good Prince; presented in the Panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan, the best of Roman Emperors'', London, 1686, 8vo, with a high-flown preface expressing his loyalty to the throne.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Political views===\nKennett's political views were quickly modified by dislike of the ecclesiastical policy of [[James II of England|James II]]. He preached a series of discourses against \"popery\", refused to read the 'Declaration for Liberty of Conscience' in 1688, and acted with the majority of the clergy in the diocese of Oxford when they rejected an address to the king recommended by Bishop Parker. Hearne relates that at the beginning of the [[Glorious Revolution]] Kennett lent Dodwell a manuscript treatise, composed by himself and never printed, offering arguments for taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to William and Mary. Subsequently, Kennett openly supported the cause of the revolution, and thereby exposed himself to much obloquy from his former friends, who called him 'Weathercock Kennett'. In January 1689, while shooting at Middleton Stoney, his gun burst and fractured his skull. The operation of trepanning was successfully performed, but he was obliged to wear a large black patch of velvet on his forehead during the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAfter a few years' absence at Ambrosden he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], and in September 1691 was chosen lecturer of [[Carfax, Oxford|St Martin's, commonly called Carfax, Oxford]]. He was also appointed a public lecturer in the schools, and filled the office of pro-proctor for two successive years. He proceeded [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] on 5 May 1694. In February 1694\u20135 he was presented by William Cherry to the rectory of [[Shottesbrooke]], Berkshire. He was created [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] at Oxford on 19 July 1700, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]]. He resigned the vicarage of Ambrosden, and did not obtain possession of St Botolph's without a lawsuit. On 15 February 1701 he was installed in the [[Prebendary|prebend]] of Combe and Harnham, in the church of Salisbury.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Antiquarian reputation===\nKennett's historical and antiquarian researches had meanwhile procured him some reputation. From [[George Hickes (divine)|Dr George Hickes]] (afterwards [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] bishop of Thetford), who lived for a time in seclusion with him at Ambrosden, he received instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and other northern tongues. For several years the two scholars were on the most friendly terms, but eventually there was an open rupture between them, owing to religious and political differences. Kennett contributed a life of [[William Somner]] to the [[James Brome]]'s edition of that antiquary's ''Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent'' (1693), and the biography was enlarged and reissued in Somner's ''Treatise of Gavelkind'', 2nd edition 1726. His reputation as a [[Topography|topographer]] and [[Philology|philologist]] was enhanced by his ''Parochial Antiquities attempted in the History of Ambrosden, Burcester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks, with a Glossary of Obsolete Terms'', Oxford, 1695, 4to, dedicated to his patron, Sir W. Glynne. A new edition, greatly enlarged from the author's manuscript notes, was issued at Oxford (2 vols. 1818, 4to) under the editorship of [[Bulkeley Bandinel]]. While engaged on this work the question of lay impropriations had come much under his notice, and he published \"for the terror of evil-doers\" the ''History and Fate of Sacrilege, discovered by examples of Scripture, of Heathens, of Christians'', London, 1698, 8vo, written by [[Henry Spelman|Sir Henry Spelman]] in 1632, but omitted from the edition of that author's ''Posthumous Works''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Chaplain to Bishop Gardiner===\nKennett was now chaplain to [[James Gardiner (bishop)|Bishop Gardiner of Lincoln]], and on 15 May 1701 became archdeacon of Huntingdon. Thereupon he entered into a controversy with [[Francis Atterbury]] about the rights of [[Convocation]], and ably supported [[William Wake|Dr Wake]] and [[Edmund Gibson]] in their contention that convocation had few inherent rights of independent action. In Warburton's view, Kennett's arguments were based on precedents, while Atterbury's rested on principles. On [[Thomas Tenison|Archbishop Tenison's]] recommendation he was appointed in 1701 one of the original members of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]]. In a sermon preached in his parish church of Aldgate on 31 January 1703\u20134, the fast day for the martyrdom of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], Kennett acknowledged that there had been some errors in his reign, owing to a 'popish' queen and a corrupt ministry, whose policy tended in the direction of an absolute tyranny. To correct exaggerated statements made about this sermon, Kennett printed it under the title of ''A Compassionate Enquiry into the Causes of the Civil War'', London (three editions), 1704, 4to. It elicited many angry replies from his high-church opponents.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1704 he published ''The Case of Impropriations, and of the Augmentation of Vicarages, and other insufficient Cures, stated by History and Law, from the first Usurpations of the Popes and Monks, to her Majesty's Royal Bounty lately extended to the poorer Clergy of the Church of England''. A copy of this work, bound in two vols., with copious additions by the author, was formerly in the possession of [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]], and is now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. In 1705 some booksellers undertook a collection of the best works on English history down to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and induced Kennett to write a continuation to the time of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Although it appeared anonymously as the third volume of the ''Compleat History of England'', 1706, fol., the author's name soon became known, and he was exposed to renewed attacks from his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] enemies. A new edition, with corrections, was published in 1719, but it was not until 1740 that there appeared [[Roger North (biographer)|Roger North's]] ''Examen, or an Inquiry into the Credit and Veracity of a pretended Complete History, viz. Dr. White Kennett's \"History of England\"''. His popularity at court was increased by the published denunciations of his views, and he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to her majesty. He was installed in the deanery of Peterborough 21 February 1707\u20138. A few days previously he had been collated to the prebend of Marston St Laurence, in the church of Lincoln.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA sermon which he preached at the funeral of the first [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] on 5 September 1707, and which laid him open to the charge of encouraging a deathbed repentance, was published by Henry Hills, without a dedication, in 1707. To a second edition, published by John Churchill in 1708, with a dedication to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire|William, second duke of Devonshire]], was appended ''Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish'', a separate edition of which was published by Hills in the same year. A new edition of the sermon, with the author's manuscript corrections, was published by [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] in 1797, but very few copies were sold, and the remainder were destroyed by fire. The imputation against Kennett was fresh in the memory of [[Alexander Pope]] when in the ''[[An Essay on Criticism|Essay on Criticism]]'' he wrote:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n:''Then unbelieving priests reformed the nation,''\n:''And taught more pleasing methods of salvation''\n\nKennett's subsequent preferment was naturally connected by his enemies with the strain of adulatory reference to the second duke with which the sermon concludes.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===St Mary Aldermary, London===\nIn 1707, desiring more leisure for study, he resigned the rectory of St Botolph, Aldgate, and obtained the less remunerative rectory of [[St Mary Aldermary]], London. During this period he published numerous sermons, and his pen was actively engaged in support of his party. He zealously opposed the doctrine of the invalidity of lay baptism, and his answer to [[Henry Sacheverell]]'s sermon preached before the lord mayor on 5 November 1709 raised a storm of indignation. In 1710 he was severely censured for not joining in the congratulatory address of the London clergy to the queen, which was drawn up on the accession of the tories to office after Sacheverell's trial. Kennett and others who declined to subscribe it were represented as enemies to the crown and ministry.\n\n[[Richard Welton]], rector of [[St Mary Matfelon]], Whitechapel, introduced into an altar-piece in his church a portrait of Kennett to represent [[Judas Iscariot]]. It was stated that the rector had caused Kennett's figure to be substituted for that of [[Gilbert Burnet]] at the suggestion of the painter, who feared an action of [[Privilege of peerage#Scandalum magnatum|''scandalum magnatum'']] if Burnet were introduced. A print of the picture in the library of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] is accompanied with these manuscript lines by [[Michel Maittaire]]:\n\n:''To say the picture does to him belong,''\n:''Kennett does Judas and the Painter wrong.''\n:''False is the image, the resemblance faint:''\n:''Judas compared to Kennett is a Saint.''\n\nMultitudes of people visited the church daily to see the painting, but [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], bishop of London, soon ordered its removal. For many years afterwards it is said to have ornamented the high altar at [[St Albans Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Society for the Propagation of the Gospel===\nTo advance the interests of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Kennett made a collection of books, charts, maps, and documents, with the intention of composing a ''History of the Propagation of Christianity in the English-American Colonies'', and on the relinquishment of that project he presented his collections to the corporation, and printed a catalogue entitled ''Bibliothec\u00e6 American\u00e6 Primordia'', London, 1713, 4to, afterwards republished with additions by [[Henry Homer the elder]], 1789, 4to. He also founded an antiquarian and historical library at Peterborough, and enriched the library of that church with some scarce books, including an abstract of the manuscript collections made by Dr John Cosens, bishop of that see, and a copiously annotated copy of [[Simon Gunton|Gunton's]] ''History of Peterborough''. The collection, consisting of about fifteen hundred books and tracts, was placed in a private room at Peterborough, and a manuscript catalogue was drawn up and subscribed ''Index librorum aliquot vetustorum quos in commune bonum congessit W. K., Decan. Petriburg. MDCCXII''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Bishop of Peterborough===\nOn 25 July 1713 Kennett was installed prebendary of Farrendon-cum-Balderton at Lincoln. He preached vehemently against the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], and in the two following years warmly advocated the repeal of the acts against occasional conformity. In the [[Bangorian controversy]] he opposed the proceedings of convocation against [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. By the influence of his friend [[Charles Trimnell|Dr Charles Trimnell]], bishop of Norwich and afterwards of Winchester, he was appointed bishop of Peterborough; he was consecrated at [[Lambeth Palace|Lambeth]] on 9 November 1718, and had permission to hold the archdeaconry of Huntingdon and a prebend in Salisbury in commendam. He died ten years later at his house in [[St James's Street]] Westminster, on 19 December 1728. He was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]], where a marble monument with a brief Latin inscription was erected to his memory.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Family===\nHe married first, on 6 June 1693, Sarah, only daughter of Robert and Mary Carver of Bicester (she died on 2 March 1693\u20134, sine prole); secondly, on 6 June 1695, Sarah, sister of Richard Smith, M.D., of London and Aylesbury (she died in August 1702); thirdly, in 1703, Dorcas, daughter of Thomas Fuller, D.D., rector of Wellinghale, Essex, and widow of Clopton Havers, M.D. (she died 9 July 1743). His second wife bore him a son, White Kennett, rector of Burton-le-Coggles, Lincolnshire, and prebendary of Peterborough, Lincoln, and London, who died on 6 May 1740; and a daughter Sarah, who married John Newman of Shottesbrook, Berkshire, and died on 22 February 1756. Hearne, writing on 26 April 1707, says that Kennett's 'present [his third] wife wears the breeches, as his haughty, insolent temper deserves'.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Character===\nHis biographer, the Rev. William Newton, admits that his zeal as a whig partisan sometimes carried him to extremes, but he was very charitable, and displayed great moderation in his relations with the dissenters. He is now remembered chiefly as a painstaking and laborious antiquary, especially in the department of ecclesiastical biography. The number of his works both in print and manuscript shows him to have been throughout his life a man of incredible diligence and application. He was always ready to communicate the results of his researches to fellow-students.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{abbreviations|section|cf. to. q.v. &c. etcetera|date=January 2015}}\n{{citation style|section|date=January 2015}}\n\nProbably his best-known work, apart from his ''Compleat History'', was his ''Register and Chronicle, Ecclesiastical and Civil: containing Matters of Fact delivered in the words of the most Authentick Books, Papers, and Records; digested in exact order of time. With papers, notes, and references towards discovering and connecting the true History of England from the Restauration of King Charles II'', vol. i. London, 1728, fol. The original materials for this valuable work are preserved in the [[British Museum]] among the [[Lansdowne manuscripts]]. 1002\u20131010. The manuscript volumes bring the register to 1679. The published volume begins with the Restoration, and only comes down to December 1662.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nKennett published more than twelve separate sermons preached on public occasions between 1694 and 1728, and others in support of charity schools (cf. ''The Excellent Daughter'', 1708; 11th edit. 1807) or of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (cf. sermon issued in 1712). His addresses to his clergy at Peterborough on his first visitation were issued in 1720.

Some manuscript verses by Kennett on ''Religious and Moral Subjects, translated from some of the chief Italian Poets'', belonged to S. W. Rix in 1855, and manuscript notes by Kennett, written in a Bible, were printed in ''Notes and Queries'' for 1885. Sir Walter Scott first printed, in his ''Life of Swift'', p.&nbsp;137, from a manuscript in the British Museum, the well-known description by Kennett of Swift's attendance in Queen Anne's antechamber (November 1713).<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMany of Kennett's manuscripts, which once formed part of the library of James West, president of the Royal Society, were purchased in 1773 by the Earl of Shelburne (afterwards Marquis of Lansdowne), with whose collection they passed, in 1807, to the British Museum. They are now numbered 935\u20131041 in the Lansdowne collection.
