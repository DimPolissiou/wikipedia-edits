While the term is applied especially to those who served during [[World War I]],<ref>\"war poet noun\" ''The Oxford Dictionary of English'' (revised edition). Ed. Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. [[Oxford University Press]], 2005</ref> the term can be applied to a poet of any nationality writing about any war, including [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', from around the 8th century BC, and the [[Old English]] poem ''[[The Battle of Maldon (poem)|The Battle of Maldon]]'', which celebrated the [[Battle of Maldon|actual Battle of Maldon in 991]], as well as poetry of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Crimean War]] and other wars.\n\n==Jacobite Uprising of 1745==\nIn the [[Scottish Gaelic language]], the greatest war poet of the [[Jacobite Uprising of 1745]] was [[Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair]], who served as a Captain of the [[Clanranald]] men from the raising of the Standard at [[Glenfinnan]] until the final defeat at the [[Battle of Culloden]]. \n\nOther poems about the Uprising were written in both Gaelic and English by [[John Roy Stewart]], who served as [[Colonel]] of the Edinburgh Regiment and a close and trusted confidant of Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]]. \n\nThe [[Irish language]] poem ''[[Mo Ghile Mear]]'', which was composed by the [[County Cork]] [[Bard]] [[Se\u00e1n \"Cl\u00e1rach\" Mac Domhnaill]], is a lament for the defeat of the Uprising at the [[Battle of Culloden]]. The poem is a [[soliloquy]] by the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], whom Se\u00e1n Cl\u00e1rach personifies as a woman. The woman laments her state and describes herself as a grieving widow due to the defeat and exile of her lawful King.\n\nPoems about the Jacobite Uprising, have also been written in English by Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[Carolina Nairne]], [[Agnes Maxwell MacLeod]], [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]], and [[William Hamilton (Jacobite poet)|William Hamilton]].\n\n==German Revolutions of 1848\u201349==\n[[Georg Herwegh]] who wrote during the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349]] is an example of a 19th century German war poet.<ref name=Columb>[[Herwegh, Georg]], [[The Columbia Encyclopedia]] (2008)</ref><ref>[[The Times]], ''Southern Germany'', 29 September 1848</ref>\n\n==Crimean War==\nProbably the most famous 19th century war poem is [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", which he supposedly wrote in only a few minutes after reading an account of the battle in ''[[The Times]]''.

A number of them died on the battlefield, most famously [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Wilfred Owen]], and [[Charles Sorley]]. Others including [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Richard Perceval Graves, \u2018Graves, Robert von Ranke (1895\u20131985)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> [[Ivor Gurney]] and Siegfried Sassoon survived but were scarred by their experiences, and this was reflected in their poetry. Robert H. Ross describes the British \"war poets\" as [[Georgian Poetry|Georgian poets]].<ref>''The Georgian Revolt'', p. 166.</ref> Many poems by British war poets were published in newspapers and then collected in anthologies. Several of these early anthologies were published during the war and were very popular, though the tone of the poetry changed as the war progressed. One of the wartime anthologies, ''[[The Muse in Arms]]'', was published in 1917, and several were published in the years following the war.\n\n[[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]]' [[epic poem]] of World War I ''[[In Parenthesis]]'' was first published in England in 1937, and is based on Jones's own experience as an infantryman in the War. ''In Parenthesis'' narrates the experiences of English Private John Ball in a mixed English-Welsh regiment starting with their leaving England and ending seven months later with the assault on [[Mametz Wood]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The work employs a mixture of lyrical verse and prose, is highly allusive, and ranges in tone from formal to [[Cockney]] colloquial and military slang. The poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] and the admiration of writers such as [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Dilworth, Thomas. ''Reading David Jones''.

He later recalled that when the war began, his first feelings of patriotism were towards Germany. After being briefly interned at [[Trier]] and ordered to leave the country, Sorley returned to [[Great Britain]] and enlisted in the [[Suffolk Regiment]] as a [[Lieutenant]]. He was killed by a German [[sniper]] during the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915 and his poems and letters were published posthumously. \n\n[[Robert Graves]] described Charles Sorley in ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' as \"one of the three poets of importance killed during the war\". (The other two being [[Isaac Rosenberg]] and [[Wilfred Owen]].) Sorley believed that Germans and British were equally blind to each other's humanity and his [[anti-war]] poetry stands in direct contrast to the jingoistic nationalism of [[Rupert Brooke]].\n\nIn 1969, [[Gairm]] posthumously published the first book of poems by [[D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh Chor\u00f9na]], a combat veteran of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|King's Own Cameron Highlanders]] during World War I and war poet in the [[Scottish Gaelic language]]. Unlike [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]], D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh believed himself to be fighting a [[just war]] against a terrible enemy. His anger over the futility of the war only boiled over after he returned to his home in [[North Uist]], in the [[Outer Hebrides]], and found that none of the promises that had been made to soldiers from the Scottish [[Highlands and Islands]] were going to be kept. The rents were still high, the population was still impoverished, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] were still prosecuted as [[poaching]], and the [[omnipotence]] of the island's [[Anglo-Scottish]] landlord was exactly as it had been before the war began.\n\n[[File:Thiepval Memorial to the missing.jpg|thumb|right|Thiepval Memorial, France.]]\nD\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's poetry book proved very popular and began being used to teach the Gaelic language in the schools of the Scottish Highlands and Islands. An expanded and [[bilingual]] edition was published by the Historical Society of North Uist in 1995. In 2016, Scottish folk singer and North Uist native [[Julie Fowlis]] performed D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's war songs in Gaelic at the [[Thiepval Memorial]] on the hundredth anniversary of the [[Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Wales===\nAt the outbreak of World War I, [[militarism]] was seen in [[Wales]] as a very English trait. Throughout the war, voluntary enlistments remained very low and [[conscription]] was ultimately enacted to forcibly bring the [[Welsh people]] into the [[British armed forces]]. \n\n[[File:Hedd Wyn statue.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Hedd Wyn]] in his home village of [[Trawsfynydd]].]]\nThe most famous [[Welsh language]] war poet remains Private [[Ellis Humphrey Evans]] of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], who is best known under his [[bardic name]] of [[Hedd Wyn]]. Hedd Wyn was killed by [[shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] from a German shell during his battalion's assault on [[Pilckem Ridge]] during the first day of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917. Just a few weeks later, he was posthumously [[Chairing of the Bard|awarded the Chair]] at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]]. The [[Bardic Chair]] was delivered to the farmhouse of the Bard's parents draped in a black sheet.\n\n[[File:Cynan 1956 Aberdar.jpg|thumb|The Archdruid Cynan (middle) at the National Eisteddfod at Aberdare, 1956.]]\nAnother great [[Welsh language]] war poet was Rev. [[Albert Evans-Jones]], who served on the [[Macedonian Front|Salonica Front]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a [[RAMC]] ambulance man and later as a [[military chaplain]]. After the war, he became a minister for the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]] and wrote many poems that shocked the Welsh population with their graphic descriptions of the horrors of the trenches and their savage attacks on wartime [[ultra-nationalism]]. Rev. Evans-Jones, whom [[Alan Llwyd]] considers the greatest Welsh poet of the Great War, is best known under the [[bardic name]] of [[Cynan]]. \n\nWelsh poet Alan Llwyd's English translations of many poems by both poets appear in the volume ''Out of the Fire of Hell; Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914-1918 in Prose and Verse''.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:LostBattalionMonument.JPG|thumb|right|Monument to the [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]], Argonne Forest, France.]]\nThe [[United States]] only entered the Great War in May 1917. By that time, the mass mechanized slaughter at [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], which still haunt the other combatant nations, had already taken place. \n\nBy the time large numbers of soldiers from the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] arrived in France, they faced an [[Imperial German Army]] that was starving, exhausted, and which had already been bled white by three years of war. Furthermore, the [[German people]] were being systematically starved by a [[Royal Navy]] blockade and were increasingly on the brink of [[German Revolution of 1918|Revolution]]. Although American [[Doughboys]] helped stem the [[1918 Spring Offensive]], won the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]], and saved the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] from having to contract a negotiated peace with the [[Central Powers]], America's losses were far fewer than those of other nations. For this reason, [[World War I]] is a forgotten war in America today. \n\nAlthough [[World War I]] in [[American literature]] is widely believed to begin and end with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[war novel]] ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', there were also American war poets. \n\n[[File:Alan seeger foreign legion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Seeger]] in his [[French Foreign Legion]] uniform]]\n[[Alan Seeger]], the uncle of [[Marxist]] folk singer [[Pete Seeger]], enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] while America was still neutral and became the first great American poet of the First World War.

Decades after his passing, Seeger's poem ''I Have a Rendezvous with Death'' was a great favorite of [[U.S. President]] [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]]. Seeger is sometimes called, \"The American [[Rupert Brooke]].\"\n\n[[File:Joyce Kilmer.jpg|thumb|Sgt. Joyce Kilmer, as a member of the Fighting 69th Infantry Regiment, United States Army, c. 1918]]\nAmerican poet and [[Roman Catholic]] convert [[Joyce Kilmer]], who was widely considered America's answer to [[G.K. Chesterton]], served in France as a [[Sergeant]] with the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|Fighting 69th]]. Sgt. Kilmer was beginning to write war poems at the time that he was killed by a German [[sniper]] during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] on July 30, 1918. \n\n[[File:John Allen Wyeth.jpg|thumb|right|John Allen Wyeth, late 1970s.]]\nIn 1928, American poet and World War I veteran [[John Allan Wyeth (poet)|John Allan Wyeth]] published ''This Man's Army: A War in Fifty-Odd Sonnets''. The collection, which is written in an experimental form unique in the history of the [[sonnet]], traces Wyeth's military service as a [[Lieutenant]] with the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd U.S. Infantry Division]] from the time he received orders to embark for France, during the ocean voyage and through his journey into the firing line. Although the collection was very well reviewed, the [[1929 Stock Market Crash]] soon followed its publication and Wyeth's poetry was swiftly forgotten. When John Allan Wyeth died on May 11, 1981, his [[obituary]] made no mention of the fact that he had been a poet.\n\nAccording to poet and literary critic [[Dana Gioia]], who rescued Wyeth's poetry from oblivion during the early [[21st century]], Wyeth is the only American poet of the First World War who can be compared with English war poets [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], and [[Wilfred Owen]]. Gioia also writes that every event that Wyeth relates in his sonnets, down to the way he describes the weather, can be verified by other sources as completely accurate.\n\n===Ireland===\n[[File:Memorial Garden Cross.jpg|thumb|Great Cross above the Stone of Remembrance, with wreaths of commemoration, [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]], [[Dublin]].]]\nThe involvement of [[Irish people]] in the [[British armed forces]] during World War I remains very controversial. This was because Ireland's struggle for Independence took place during the same era and Irishmen who fought for the Crown were seen as traitors. Nevertheless, there were also Irish war poets.\n\n[[File:Thomas M. Kettle memorial in St. Stephen's Green park, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Thomas M. Kettle Memorial, [[St. Stephen's Green]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.]]\nOne of them, poet [[Tom Kettle]], a former member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and [[M.P.]] for the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], was, despite his sympathy for Occupied Belgium, very critical of the war at first. Comparing the [[Anglo-Irish]] landlord class with the big estate owners who similarly dominated the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], Kettle wrote, \"England goes to fight for [[liberty]] in [[Europe]] and for [[Junker (Prussia)|Junkerdom]] in Ireland.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), page 42.</ref>\n\nLater, when he was serving as a [[Lieutenant]] with the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], Kettle learned of the 17 executions that followed the crushing of the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916. In response, Kettle wrote, \"These men will go down in history as heroes and martyrs and I will go down - if I go down at all - as a bloody British officer.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 41.</ref> \n\nKettle's best known poem is a sonnet, \"To My Daughter Betty, the Gift of God\", written just days before he was shot in the chest during the [[Battle of Ginchy|attack on Ginchy]], during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. His body was never found. The last lines of the [[sonnet]] say that the soldiers of all nations during the Great War, \"Died not for flag, nor King, nor Emperor/But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed/And for the secret Scripture of the poor.\"<ref>Jim Haughey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8AbeSLHBa8C&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The First World War in Irish Poetry''], Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 102<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref> \n\n[[File:Frontispiece, The Complete Poems of Francis Ledwidge, 1919.jpg|thumb|left|Francis Ledwidge in uniform.]]\nWhen [[Francis Ledwidge]], who was a member of the [[Irish Volunteers]], learned of the outbreak of the war, he decided against enlisting in the [[British Army]]. After being put on trial by the [[National Volunteers]] and accused of [[cowardice]] and of being Pro-German, Ledwidge enlisted in the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. He published three volumes of poetry between 1916\u201318, while he served at the [[Landing at Suvla Bay]], on the [[Macedonian Front]] and on the Western Front. Ledwidge expressed a belief in his poems and letters that he was fighting for [[Ireland]] rather than for the [[United Kingdom]]. Ultimately, Francis Ledwidge was \"blown to bits\" by a German shell while drinking tea in a shell hole on the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge|first day]] of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917.

Maj. Gregory, who died when his [[Sopwith Camel]] crashed near [[Padua]], [[Italy]] on January 23, 1918, was an [[Irish nationalist]], a friend of Yeats, and the son of his patroness Lady [[Augusta Gregory]]. [[Royal Flying Corps]] records in the [[British National Archives]] state that Maj. Gregory was \"shot down in error by an Italian pilot\", a claim that has been repeated by both Yeats' and Lady Gregory's biographers. In 2017, Geoffrey O'Byrne White, a director of the [[Irish Aviation Authority]], the great-grandnephew of Lady Gregory, and a former pilot in the [[Irish Air Corps]], said he believed Major Gregory had become incapacitated at high altitude, attributing this to an [[inoculation]] that morning against [[influenza]].<ref>Ray Burke, \"Challenge to official accounts of Gregory death in WWI,\" 2 January 2018, RT\u00c9 News Now, https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2018/0101/930446-robert-gregory/</ref>\n\nIn Yeats' poem, Maj. Gregory declares that he does not hate the German and Austro-Hungarian pilots he fights against or love the [[British Empire]], which he defends. He comments that his countrymen are the poor [[Irish Catholics|Irish Catholic]] tenants of his mother's estate at [[Kiltartan]], [[County Galway]], that they will not mourn his death, and that his passing will have done nothing to improve their lives. He comments that he signed up to fight not for law, duty, the speeches of politicians, or the cheering crowds, but for, \"a lonely impulse of delight.\"\n\n[[File:Yeats1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William Butler Yeats]] as photographed in 1923.]]\nWishing to show restraint from publishing a political poem during the height of the Great War, Yeats withheld publication of ''An Irish Airman Forsees His Death'' until after the 1918 [[Armistice]].<ref name=Foster>Foster 2001 pp. 68\u201369</ref> \n\n\"[[The Second Coming]]\" is a poem written by Irish poet W.

Milner-Gulland in A.K. Thorlby (ed.), ''[[The Penguin Companion to Literature|The Penguin Companion to Literature: European]]'' (Penguin, 1969), p. 762.</ref>\n\nThe [[Acmeist]] poet [[Nikolay Gumilyov]] served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during World War I. He saw combat in [[East Prussia]], the [[Macedonian Front]], and with the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France]]. He was also decorated twice with the [[Cross of St. George]]. Gumilyov's war poems were assembled in the collection ''The Quiver'' (1916).\n\nGumilyov's wife, the poetess [[Anna Akhmatova]], began writing poems during World War I that expressed the collective suffering of the [[Russian people]] as men were called up and the women in their lives bade them goodbye. For Akhmatova, writing such poems turned into her life's work and she continued writing similar poems about the suffering of the Russian people during the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Terror]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].\n\n===France===\nAmongst French World War I poets are the following: [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Adrien Bertrand]], [[Yvan Goll]], and [[Charles P\u00e9guy]].\n\n[[File:Louis Pergaud.jpg|thumb|left|Louis Pergaud]]\nThe French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Louis Pergaud]] considered himself a [[Pacifism|Pacifist]] and, at the outbreak of war in 1914, he tried in vain to register as a [[conscientious objector]]. Instead, he was conscripted into the [[French Army]] and sent to the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nOn 7 April 1915, Pergaud's regiment attacked the [[Imperial German Army]]'s trenches near [[Fresnes-en-Wo\u00ebvre]], during which he was wounded. Pergaud fell into [[barbed wire]], where he became trapped. Several hours later, German soldiers rescued him and other wounded French soldiers and took them to a temporary [[field hospital]] behind German lines. On the morning of April 8, 1915, Pergaud and many other [[POW]]s were killed by [[friendly fire]], when a French artillery barrage destroyed the hospital.\n\nThe [[Breton language]] poet and activist [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], a former Catholic seminarian who was best known by his [[Bardic name]] of ''Bleimor'', enlisted in the [[French Army]] on the outbreak of war in 1914. Like many others, Kalloc'h believed that France's war against Germany was a defense of civilization and [[Christianity]] and that it would lead to the resurrection of the Catholic Faith and the [[Breton language]] and [[Breton culture|culture]]. Ultimately, Kalloc'h, who wielded a sailor's axe in hand to hand combat in the trenches, was killed when a German shell landed near his dugout on April 10, 1917. His last poetry collection, ''Ar en Deulin'', was published posthumously.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Unter den Linden 4, Neue Wache.jpg|thumb|The [[Neo-Classical]] portal of the [[Neue Wache]] on [[Unter den Linden]] in [[Berlin]], which has been Germany's primary war memorial since 1931.]]\nGerman World War I poets include: [[Rudolf G. Binding]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[August Stramm]].\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1914, [[Gerrit Engelke]], a [[working class]] poet from [[Hanover]], was in neutral [[Denmark]]. He at first hesitated to return, but was ultimately forced to do so by financial pressures. He served in combat for four years, experiencing the battles of [[Langemarck]], [[Battle of St. Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], D\u00fcnaberg, and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. In 1916, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for swimming across the flooded [[Yser River]]. Engelke was wounded in 1917 and, during his recovery, he became engaged to a war widow, but was forced to return to combat in May 1918. His friends attempted to have him transferred away from the firing line, much to Engelke's outrage, as he felt a deep loyalty to his brothers in arms. He was fatally injured in a successful British assault on October 11, 1918 and died the following day at a British [[field hospital]]. He had previously written, \"The greatest task which faces us after the war will be to forgive our enemy, who has, after all, been our neighbour on Earth since Creation.\"<ref> Tim Cross(1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 81.</ref> \n\nGerrit Engelke is best known for his [[anti-war]] poem ''An die Soldaten Des Grossen Krieges'' (\"To the Soldiers of the Great War\"), a poem in [[rhyme]]d [[dactylic hexameter]] modeled after the Neo-Classical odes of [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. In the ode, Engelke urges the soldiers of all the combatant nations to join hands together in universal brotherhood. An English translation exists by Patrick Bridgwater.\n\n[[File:Walter Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Walter Flex]]\n[[Walter Flex]], who is best known as the author of the war poem ''[[Wild Geese (song)|Wildg\u00e4nse rauschen durch die Nacht]]'', was a native of [[Eisenach]] and attended the [[University of Erlangen]] before the outbreak of war. After service on both the Eastern and Western Fronts, Flex was [[killed in action]] at [[Saaremaa]], [[Estonia]] during [[Operation Albion]] on October 17, 1917. His poems, which were very patriotic in nature, remained very popular until the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Lajos Tihanyi Yvan Goll 1927.jpg|thumb|left|Yvan Goll in 1927.]]\n[[Yvan Goll]], a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] poet from the disputed territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], wrote bilingually in both German and French. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Goll fled to [[Switzerland]] to evade [[conscription]] into the [[Imperial German Army]]. While there, he wrote many [[anti-war]] poems, in which he sought to promote better understanding between Germany and France. His most famous poem is ''[[Requiem f\u00fcr die Todte in Europa]]'' (''[[Requiem for the Dead of Europe]]'').\n\n[[File:Stefan George 1910 Foto Jakob Hilsdorf.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan George in 1910.]]\n[[Stefan George]], a German poet who had done his literary [[apprenticeship]] with the French [[Symbolist]] poets in [[Paris]], still had many friends in [[France]] and viewed the Great War as disastrous. In his 1916 [[anti-war]] poem ''Der Krieg'' (\"The War\"), George attacked the horrors that soldiers of all nations were facing in the trenches. In the poem, George famously declared, \"The ancient god of battles is no more.\"\n\n[[File:RJSorge1.jpg|thumb|Reinhard Johannes Sorge on [[Furlough]] in [[Berlin]], 1915]]\n[[Reinhard Sorge]], the [[Kleist Prize]] winning author of the [[Expressionist]] play ''Der Bettler'', saw the coming of the war as an idealistic recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He wrote many poems, many of them in experimental forms, about both his Catholic Faith and what he was witnessing as a soldier with the [[Imperial German Army]] in France. Shortly before being [[mortally wounded]] by a grenade during the [[Battle of the Somme]], Sorge wrote to his wife expressing a belief that what he called, \"the Anglo-French Offensive\" was going to succeed in overrunning German defenses. Sorge died in a [[field hospital]] at [[Ablaincourt-Pressoir|Ablaincourt]] on July 20, 1916. Sorge's wife only learned of his death when a letter, in which she informed her husband that he had gotten her [[pregnant]] during his last [[furlough]], was returned to her as undeliverable.\n[[Image:Het treurende ouderpaar - K\u00e4the Kolwitz.JPG|thumb|left|The sculptures of ''The Grieving Parents'' by [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], which date from the [[1930s]], stand vigil over the [[Vladslo German war cemetery]] in [[Belgium]].]]\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:BASA-1221K-1-48-11.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers resting in a trench]]\nThere were also war poets from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\n[[Franz Janowitz]], a Jewish poet from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], had enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a one year volunteer in 1913. He was wounded by machine gun fire during an assault on Monte Rombon and died of his wounds on November 4, 1917. According to Jeremy Adler, \"Franz Janowitz conflicts with the received idea of the best German war poets. Neither [[wikt:realistic|realistic]], nor ironic, nor properly [[expressionist]]ic, while he excoriated the battlefield that the whole world had become, he still preserved a Faith in nobility, innocence, and song. Forced into maturity by the war, his poetic voice never lost a certain childlike note - indeed, in some of his best poems, naivety and wisdom coexist to an almost paradoxical degree. Such poetry was fired by a vision of a transcendental realm that lay beyond conflict, but never sought to exclude death. His 25 years, the last four of which were spent in the Army, scarcely left him time to develop a wholly independent voice, but his work displays an increasing mastery of form and deepening of vision. His small ''oeuvre'' consists of ''Novellen'', essays, aphorisms, and a handful of the best German poems connected with the Great War.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 109.</ref>\n\n[[File:Georg Trakl.jpg|thumb|left|Georg Trakl.]]\n[[Georg Trakl]], an [[Expressionist]] poet from [[Salzburg]], enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a [[medical officer]] in 1914. He personally witnessed the [[Battle of Gr\u00f3dek (1914)|Battle of Gr\u00f3dek]], fought in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in which the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] suffered a bloody defeat at the hands of the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. After the battle, Trakl was left in command of a [[field hospital]] filled with wounded soldiers and [[psychosis|mentally collapsed]] from the ensuing strain.\n\nOne evening following the battle Trakl ran outside and attempted to shoot himself in order to escape from the screams of the wounded and the dying. He was prevented from doing so and was sent to a [[mental hospital]]. On the night of November 3-4, 1914, Georg Trakl died in a military hospital in [[Cracow]] from an overdose of [[cocaine]]. Trakl's [[batman (military)|batman]], however, who was the last person to whom the poet spoke, believed that the overdose was an accident, rather than [[suicide]].<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 118.</ref>  Georg Trakl is best known for the poem ''[[Grodek]]''.\n\n[[G\u00e9za Gy\u00f3ni]], a Hungarian poet, enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1914. The poems he wrote as a soldier began with optimism, but grew increasingly pessimistic as the war went on. Gy\u00f3ni was ultimately captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] after the [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915. After being held in atrocious conditions as a [[Prisoner of War]], he died in a POW camp at [[Krasnoyarsk]], in [[Siberia]] on June 25, 1917. His last book of poems was published posthumously in 1919.\n\n[[Image:Gorskii 04423u.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian [[prisoner of war|POWs]] in [[Russia]], 1915; photo by [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii|Prokudin-Gorskii]]]]\n\nA manuscript of G\u00e9za Gy\u00f3ni's [[anti-war]] poem ''Csak egy \u00e9jszak\u00e1ra'' (\"For just one night\"), in which he calls for Hungary's war profiteers and armchair patriots to come and spend just one night in the trenches, was flown out of the besieged city of Przemy\u015bl by [[aeroplane]] and caused a sensation when it was published. The poem remains very popular and is still taught in Hungarian schools. It has been translated into [[English language|English]] by [[Canadian people|Canadian]] poet [[Watson Kirkconnell]] and by [[Hungarian American]] poet [[Erika Papp Faber]]. Although Kirkconnell's translation renders Gy\u00f3ni's poem into the same idiom as [[English people|English]] war poets [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Wilfred Owen]], and [[Isaac Rosenberg]], Erika Papp Faber's version is far more faithful to the original poem in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].\n\n===Serbia===\nSerbian World War I poets include: [[Milutin Boji\u0107]], [[Vladislav Petkovi\u0107 Dis]], [[Milo\u0161 Crnjanski]], [[Du\u0161an Vasiljev]], [[Ljubomir Mici\u0107]], [[Proka Jovki\u0107]], [[Rastko Petrovi\u0107]], [[Stanislav Vinaver]], [[Branislav Milosavljevi\u0107]], [[Milosav Jeli\u0107]], Vladimir Stanimirovi\u0107. and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/riznica/veliki-srpski-pesnici-u-velikom-ratu-presao-je-preko-albanije-radio-kao-srpski/clmdxg6|title=VELIKI SRPSKI PESNICI U VELIKOM RATU Pre\u0161ao je preko Albanije, radio kao srpski obave\u0161tajac i ovekove\u010dio sahrane srpskih mladi\u0107a u BESMRTNOJ PESMI|last=Lukovi\u0107|first=Suzana|website=Blic.rs|language=sr|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Australian World War I poetry}}\n[[John O'Donnell (poet)|John O'Donnell]] was born in [[Tuam]], [[County Galway]] in 1890, and served in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] during World War I.

There were English-speaking poets serving in the Spanish Civil War on both sides.

Campbell was living in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] with his family when hostilities started. As a recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Campbell was horrified to witness the systematic [[religious persecution]] and [[Red Terror (Spain)|mass murder of Catholics]] by the Republican forces. A particularly chilling moment for Campbell was when he came across the bodies of Toledo's Carmelite monks, whom he had befriended, after Republican forces had subjected them to [[summary execution|execution without trial]]. The monks' executioner's had then written in blood above their bodies, \"Thus strikes the [[CHEKA]].\" According to Campbell's biographer, [[Joseph Pearce]], and his daughters Anna and Tess, Campbell's subsequently pro-Nationalist stance has caused him to be unfairly labeled as a [[Fascist]] and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.\n\nThe best [[Spanish language]] poets of the Civil War are [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and the Machado brothers. [[Antonio  Machado]] wrote a poem to honor the [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist]] General [[Enrique L\u00edster]],<ref name=\"A L\u00edster\">''[http://www.rafaelrobles.com/webquests/pazperpetua/documentospazperpetua/alistermachado.htm A L\u00edster, jefe en los ej\u00e9rcitos del Ebro]'', Antonio Machado, June 1938.</ref> and died a [[refugee]] in [[France]] after the defeat of the Republic. Meanwhile, his brother, [[Manuel Machado y Ruiz|Manuel Machado]], dedicated a poem to the [[saber]] of the Nationalist Generalissimo [[Francisco Franco]].\n\n[[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet [[Pablo Neruda]] became intensely politicised for the first time during the Spanish Civil War. As a result of his experiences in Spain, Neruda became an ardent [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist]] and remained one for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends were contributing factors, but the most important [[catalyst]] was the abduction and [[summary execution|execution without trial]] of the Republican poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] by Nationalist soldiers.<ref Name=\"Tarn16\">Tarn (1975) p. 16</ref> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''Espa\u00f1a en el coraz\u00f3n'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'') in 1938.

MacLean's time in the firing line ended when he was severely wounded at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. \n\nMacLean's most famous Gaelic war poem is ''Ruweisat Ridge'', which relates his thoughts on seeing a dead German soldier in North Africa. In the poem, MacLean ponders what role the dead man may have played in Nazi atrocities against both [[German Jews]] and members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. MacLean concludes, however, by saying that whatever the German soldier may or may not have done, he showed no pleasure in his death upon Ruweisat Ridge.\n\n===United States===\nThe horror of World War I was so deeply ingrained in the [[American people]] that [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s efforts to bring the United States into the war against [[Nazi Germany]] were very unpopular. The [[America First Committee]], of which [[Charles Lindbergh]] was the spokesman, and the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] were both organizing protests against Roosevelt's foreign policies. Opposition to entering the war vanished, however, when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. \n\nAlthough the [[Second World War]] is not usually thought of as a poet's war, there were American war poets.\n\nFuture [[U.S. Poet Laureate]] [[Richard Wilbur]] served as a [[Sergeant]] with the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th U.S. Infantry Division]] during the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the Allied Landings in Southern France and in the final invasion of [[Nazi Germany]]. During his war service and the decades that followed, Richard Wilbur wrote many war poems. \n\nOne of Wilbur's best known war poems is ''Tywater'', about the combat death of Corporal Lloyd Tywater, a former rodeo cowboy with a talent for rope tricks, knife throwing, and shooting swallows out of the sky with a pistol. \n\nAnother famous war poem by Richard Wilbur is ''First Snow in Alsace'', which lyrically describes the horrors of a recent battlefield in [[Occupied France]] being covered up by the beautiful sight of new fallen snow.\n\nIn an interview for the documentary ''[[The Muse of Fire]]'', Wilbur commented that there was a great difference between the war poets of [[World War I]] and those of [[World War II]]. Wilbur explained that, unlike [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Wilfred Owen]], [[World War II]] poets believed themselves to be fighting a [[just war]] and that [[Nazi Germany]], [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], and [[Imperial Japan]] were terrible enemies which needed to be confronted and destroyed. He did add that many World War II poets, including himself, felt sympathy for the plight of [[conscientious objector]]s.\n\nAmerican poet [[Dunstan Thompson]] began publishing his poems while serving as a soldier in the European Theater during World War II. Thompson's poems depict military service through the eyes of a [[homosexual]], who is engaged in casual encounters with soldiers and sailors in Blitzed London. \n\n[[Karl Shapiro]], a stylish writer with a commendable regard for his craft,<ref>Scannell, Vernon ''Not Without Glory'' Woburn Press , London 1976 {{ISBN|0713000945}}</ref>  wrote poetry in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] while he served there during World War II. His collection ''V-Letter and Other Poems'', written while Shapiro was stationed in [[New Guinea]], was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in [[1945 in literature|1945]], while Shapiro was still in the military. Shapiro was American Poet Laureate in 1946 and 1947. (At the time this title was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress which was changed by Congress in 1985 to [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]].). \n\nAlso, while serving in the U.S. Army, the American poet [[Randall Jarrell]] published his second book of poems, ''Little Friend, Little Friend'' (1945) based on his wartime experiences. The book includes one of Jarrell's best known war poems, \"[[The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner]].\" In his follow-up book, ''Losses'' (1948), he also focused on the war. The poet [[Robert Lowell]] stated publicly that he thought Jarrell had written \"the best poetry in English about the Second World War.\"<ref>Gilroy, Harry. \"Poets Honor Memory of Jarrell at Yale.\" ''The New York Times'' 1 March 1966.</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nDuring World War II, [[Anna Akhmatova]] witnessed the 900-day [[Siege of Leningrad]] and read her poems over the radio to encourage the city's defenders. In 1940, Akhmatova started her ''Poem without a Hero'', finishing a first draft in [[Tashkent]], but working on  \"The Poem\" for twenty years and considering it to be the major work of her life, dedicating it to \"the memory of its first audience \u2013 my friends and fellow citizens who perished in Leningrad during the siege\".<ref Name=\"Martin10\">Martin (2007) p. 10</ref> \n\nAfter the war, Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]] was stunned to see Akhmatova given a [[standing ovation]] by Russians who remembered her wartime broadcasts. Stalin gave orders to find out who organized the standing ovation and launched a campaign of [[blacklisting]] and defamation against the poetess, in which she was called, \"Half harlot, half nun.\"\n\nIn the 1974 poem ''[[Prussian Nights]]'', [[Soviet dissident]] [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], a former [[Captain]] in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]], graphically describes [[Soviet war crimes]] in [[East Prussia]]. The narrator, a [[Red Army]] officer, approves of his troops' looting and rapes against German civilians as revenge for [[German war crimes]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and he hopes to take part in the atrocities himself.

Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against [[French war crimes]] in the [[Algerian War]].\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Ryuichi Tamura]] (1923\u201398) who served in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during World War II is a major Japanese war poet. Following the war, he \"helped begin a poetry magazine, ''The Waste Land''\" and those poets who contributed to it were \u201cthe Waste Land Poets.\u201d  The work of these writers was especially influenced by T. S. Eliot, [[Stephen Spender]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis|C. Day-Lewis]] and [[W. H. Auden]]. Tamura's first book of poems, ''Four Thousand Days and Nights'' was published in 1956.<ref>Voices of Education, \"WWII Japanese Poets [http://voiceseducation.org/category/tag/wwii-japanese-poet]</ref>\n\n[[Sadako Kurihara]] was living in [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945 and it was then \"that her life was transformed from being a shopkeeper to becoming one of Japan\u2019s most controversial poets. Her first major collection of poems, ''Black Eggs'', published in 1946\", but it was heavily censored by the American Occupation Forces Censor, because of how she dealt with the horrors following the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. Kurihara has also \"taken a stand on Japan\u2019s aggressive rule\" during the [[Japanese occupation of China|occupation of China]], \"the mistreatment of [[Koreans in Japan]], and the need for a world-wide ban on nuclear weapons\".<ref>Voices of Education, \"WWII Japanese Poets</ref>\n\n[[File:Tadamichi Kuribayashi.jpg|thumb|General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.]]\nGeneral [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], the overall commander of the Japanese forces during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], was a poet and former diplomat who had been assigned to [[Washington, D.C.]] during the [[Interwar Period]]. Having seen America's military and industrial power first hand, Kuribayashi opposed Prime Minister [[Hideki Tojo]]'s decision to attack Pearl Harbor, saying, \"The United States is the last country in the world Japan should fight.\" It was ultimately decided to assign Kuribayashi to the [[suicide mission]] of defending [[Iwo Jima]] in order to silence his criticisms of the war.\n\nOn 17 March 1945, the General sent his farewell message to Imperial Headquarters accompanied by three traditional [[death poem]]s in ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form. Both were, according to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, \"a subtle protest against the military command that so casually sent men out to die.\"<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxv''.</ref> \n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n:Unable to complete this heavy task for our country\nArrows and bullets all spent, so sad we fall.\n\n:But unless I smite the enemy,\nMy body cannot rot in the field.\nYea, I shall be born again seven times\nAnd grasp the sword in my hand.\n\n:When ugly weeds cover this island,\nMy sole thought shall be the Imperial Land.<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxiii''.</ref>\n</poem>\n\nThe poems and the message were heavily rewritten by Japanese military censors before being published and all [[anti-war]] sentiments were removed. Instead of describing the General and his soldiers as feeling \"sad\" to fall in battle, Japanese censors rewrote the poem to say that they died in [[Banzai charge]]s, which the General had forbidden on Iwo Jima as an unnecessary waste of his men's lives. The uncensored text of both the message and the poems were only published after the [[Surrender of Japan]].\n\n===Serbia===\nAmongst Serbian poets during World War II, the most notable is [[Desanka Maksimovi\u0107]]. She is well-known for \"''Krvava bajka''\" or \"Bloody Fairy Story\". The poem is about a group of schoolchildren who fell victim to the Nazis in 1941 in [[Kragujevac massacre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/desanka-maksimovic/krvava-bajka|title=Krvava bajka - Serbo-Croatian Poetry Translation|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Later wars==\n\n===American poets===\nThe [[Korean War]] produced the American war poets [[Rolando Hinojosa]] and [[William Wantling]].\n<ref>W.

The book won the 1972 [[Yale Younger Poets Award]]. Other prominent Vietnam War poets include [[W. D.

In a clear cut case of \"criticism from the Right\", Wilbur compares U.S. President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] with [[Thomas Jefferson]] and finds the former to be greatly wanting. Commenting that Jefferson \"would have wept to see small nations dread/ The imposition of our cattle brand,\" and that in Jefferson's term, \"no army's blood was shed\", Wilbur urges President Johnson to seriously consider how history will judge him and his Administration.\n\nMost recently, the Iraq War has produced war poets including [[Brian Turner (American poet)|Brian Turner]] whose d\u00e9but collection, ''Here, Bullet'', is based on his experience as an infantry team leader with the 3rd [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team]] from November 2003 until November 2004 in [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

It depicts the [[protagonist]] as a [[tragic hero]] who has an intense dislike of the wartime [[ultranationalism]] which surrounds him and focuses on his doomed struggle to avoid [[conscription]] into the [[British Army]] during [[World War I]]. ''Hedd Wyn'' won the [[Royal Television Society]]'s Television Award for Best Single Drama.

The poem is a [[soliloquy]] by the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], whom Se\u00e1n Cl\u00e1rach personifies as a woman. The woman laments her state and describes herself as a grieving widow due to the defeat and exile of her lawful King.\n\nPoems about the Jacobite Uprising, have also been written in English by Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[Carolina Nairne]], [[Agnes Maxwell MacLeod]], [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]], and [[William Hamilton (Jacobite poet)|William Hamilton]].\n\n==German Revolutions of 1848\u201349==\n[[Georg Herwegh]] who wrote during the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349]] is an example of a 19th century German war poet.<ref name=Columb>[[Herwegh, Georg]], [[The Columbia Encyclopedia]] (2008)</ref><ref>[[The Times]], ''Southern Germany'', 29 September 1848</ref>\n\n==Crimean War==\nProbably the most famous 19th century war poem is [[Tennyson]]'s \"[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", which he supposedly wrote in only a few minutes after reading an account of the battle in ''[[The Times]]''.

A number of them died on the battlefield, most famously [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Wilfred Owen]], and [[Charles Sorley]]. Others including [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Richard Perceval Graves, \u2018Graves, Robert von Ranke (1895\u20131985)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> [[Ivor Gurney]] and Siegfried Sassoon survived but were scarred by their experiences, and this was reflected in their poetry. Robert H. Ross describes the British \"war poets\" as [[Georgian Poetry|Georgian poets]].<ref>''The Georgian Revolt'', p. 166.</ref> Many poems by British war poets were published in newspapers and then collected in anthologies. Several of these early anthologies were published during the war and were very popular, though the tone of the poetry changed as the war progressed. One of the wartime anthologies, ''[[The Muse in Arms]]'', was published in 1917, and several were published in the years following the war.\n\n[[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]]' [[epic poem]] of World War I ''[[In Parenthesis]]'' was first published in England in 1937, and is based on Jones's own experience as an infantryman in the War. ''In Parenthesis'' narrates the experiences of English Private John Ball in a mixed English-Welsh regiment starting with their leaving England and ending seven months later with the assault on [[Mametz Wood]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The work employs a mixture of lyrical verse and prose, is highly allusive, and ranges in tone from formal to [[Cockney]] colloquial and military slang. The poem won the [[Hawthornden Prize]] and the admiration of writers such as [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Dilworth, Thomas. ''Reading David Jones''.

He later recalled that when the war began, his first feelings of patriotism were towards Germany. After being briefly interned at [[Trier]] and ordered to leave the country, Sorley returned to [[Great Britain]] and enlisted in the [[Suffolk Regiment]] as a [[Lieutenant]]. He was killed by a German [[sniper]] during the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915 and his poems and letters were published posthumously. \n\n[[Robert Graves]] described Charles Sorley in ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' as \"one of the three poets of importance killed during the war\". (The other two being [[Isaac Rosenberg]] and [[Wilfred Owen]].) Sorley believed that Germans and British were equally blind to each other's humanity and his [[anti-war]] poetry stands in direct contrast to the jingoistic nationalism of [[Rupert Brooke]].\n\nIn 1969, [[Gairm]] posthumously published the first book of poems by [[D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh Chor\u00f9na]], a combat veteran of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|King's Own Cameron Highlanders]] during World War I and war poet in the [[Scottish Gaelic language]]. Unlike [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]], D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh believed himself to be fighting a [[just war]] against a terrible enemy. His anger over the futility of the war only boiled over after he returned to his home in [[North Uist]], in the [[Outer Hebrides]], and found that none of the promises that had been made to soldiers from the Scottish [[Highlands and Islands]] were going to be kept. The rents were still high, the population was still impoverished, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] were still prosecuted as [[poaching]], and the [[omnipotence]] of the island's [[Anglo-Scottish]] landlord was exactly as it had been before the war began.\n\n[[File:Thiepval Memorial to the missing.jpg|thumb|right|Thiepval Memorial, France.]]\nD\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's poetry book proved very popular and began being used to teach the Gaelic language in the schools of the Scottish Highlands and Islands. An expanded and [[bilingual]] edition was published by the Historical Society of North Uist in 1995. In 2016, Scottish folk singer and North Uist native [[Julie Fowlis]] performed D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh's war songs in Gaelic at the [[Thiepval Memorial]] on the hundredth anniversary of the [[Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Wales===\nAt the outbreak of World War I, [[militarism]] was seen in [[Wales]] as a very English trait. Throughout the war, voluntary enlistments remained very low and [[conscription]] was ultimately enacted to forcibly bring the [[Welsh people]] into the [[British armed forces]]. \n\n[[File:Hedd Wyn statue.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Hedd Wyn]] in his home village of [[Trawsfynydd]].]]\nThe most famous [[Welsh language]] war poet remains Private [[Ellis Humphrey Evans]] of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], who is best known under his [[bardic name]] of [[Hedd Wyn]]. Hedd Wyn was killed by [[shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] from a German shell during his battalion's assault on [[Pilckem Ridge]] during the first day of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917. Just a few weeks later, he was posthumously [[Chairing of the Bard|awarded the Chair]] at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]]. The [[Bardic Chair]] was delivered to the farmhouse of the Bard's parents draped in a black sheet.\n\n[[File:Cynan 1956 Aberdar.jpg|thumb|The Archdruid Cynan (middle) at the National Eisteddfod at Aberdare, 1956.]]\nAnother great [[Welsh language]] war poet was Rev. [[Albert Evans-Jones]], who served on the [[Macedonian Front|Salonica Front]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a [[RAMC]] ambulance man and later as a [[military chaplain]]. After the war, he became a minister for the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]] and wrote many poems that shocked the Welsh population with their graphic descriptions of the horrors of the trenches and their savage attacks on wartime [[ultra-nationalism]]. Rev. Evans-Jones, whom [[Alan Llwyd]] considers the greatest Welsh poet of the Great War, is best known under the [[bardic name]] of [[Cynan]]. \n\nWelsh poet Alan Llwyd's English translations of many poems by both poets appear in the volume ''Out of the Fire of Hell; Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914-1918 in Prose and Verse''.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:LostBattalionMonument.JPG|thumb|right|Monument to the [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]], Argonne Forest, France.]]\nThe [[United States]] only entered the Great War in May 1917. By that time, the mass mechanized slaughter at [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], which still haunt the other combatant nations, had already taken place. \n\nBy the time large numbers of soldiers from the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] arrived in France, they faced an [[Imperial German Army]] that was starving, exhausted, and which had already been bled white by three years of war. Furthermore, the [[German people]] were being systematically starved by a [[Royal Navy]] blockade and were increasingly on the brink of [[German Revolution of 1918|Revolution]]. Although American [[Doughboys]] helped stem the [[1918 Spring Offensive]], won the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]], and saved the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] from having to contract a negotiated peace with the [[Central Powers]], America's losses were far fewer than those of other nations. For this reason, [[World War I]] is a forgotten war in America today. \n\nAlthough [[World War I]] in [[American literature]] is widely believed to begin and end with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[war novel]] ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', there were also American war poets. \n\n[[File:Alan seeger foreign legion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Seeger]] in his [[French Foreign Legion]] uniform]]\n[[Alan Seeger]], the uncle of [[Marxist]] folk singer [[Pete Seeger]], enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] while America was still neutral and became the first great American poet of the First World War.

The collection, which is written in an experimental form unique in the history of the [[sonnet]], traces Wyeth's military service as a [[Lieutenant]] with the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd U.S. Infantry Division]] from the time he received orders to embark for France, during the ocean voyage and through his journey into the firing line. Although the collection was very well reviewed, the [[1929 Stock Market Crash]] soon followed it's publication and Wyeth's poetry was swiftly forgotten. When John Allan Wyeth died on May 11, 1981, his [[obituary]] made no mention of the fact that he had been a poet.\n\nAccording to poet and literary critic [[Dana Gioia]], who rescued Wyeth's poetry from oblivion during the early [[21st century]], Wyeth is the only American poet of the First World War who can be compared with English war poets [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], and [[Wilfred Owen]].

This was because Ireland's struggle for Independence took place during the same era and Irishmen who fought for the Crown were seen as traitors. Nevertheless, there were also Irish war poets.\n\n[[File:Thomas M. Kettle memorial in St. Stephen's Green park, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Thomas M.

After being put on trial by the [[National Volunteers]] and accused of [[cowardice]] and of being Pro-German, Ledwidge enlisted in the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]. He published three volumes of poetry between 1916\u201318, while he served at the [[Landing at Suvla Bay]], on the [[Macedonian Front]] and on the Western Front. Ledwidge expressed a belief in his poems and letters that he was fighting for [[Ireland]] rather than for the [[United Kingdom]]. Ultimately, Francis Ledwidge was \"blown to bits\" by a German shell while drinking tea in a shell hole on the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge|first day]] of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917.

Maj.

[[Royal Flying Corps]] records in the [[British National Archives]] state that Maj. Gregory was \"shot down in error by an Italian pilot\", a claim that has been repeated by both Yeats' and Lady Gregory's biographers. In 2017, Geoffrey O'Byrne White, a director of the [[Irish Aviation Authority]], the great-grandnephew of Lady Gregory, and a former pilot in the [[Irish Air Corps]], said he believed Major Gregory had become incapacitated at high altitude, attributing this to an [[inoculation]] that morning against [[influenza]].<ref>Ray Burke, \"Challenge to official accounts of Gregory death in WWI,\" 2 January 2018, RT\u00c9 News Now, https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2018/0101/930446-robert-gregory/</ref>\n\nIn Yeats' poem, Maj.

He comments that his countrymen are the poor [[Irish Catholics|Irish Catholic]] tenants of his mother's estate at [[Kiltartan]], [[County Galway]], that they will not mourn his death, and that his passing will have done nothing to improve their lives.

He saw combat in [[East Prussia]], the [[Macedonian Front]], and with the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France]]. He was also decorated twice with the [[Cross of St. George]]. Gumilyov's war poems were assembled in the collection ''The Quiver'' (1916).\n\nGumilyov's wife, the poetess [[Anna Akhmatova]], began writing poems during World War I that expressed the collective suffering of the [[Russian people]] as men were called up and the women in their lives bade them goodbye. For Akhmatova, writing such poems turned into her life's work and she continued writing similar poems about the suffering of the Russian people during the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Terror]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].\n\n===France===\nAmongst French World War I poets are the following: [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Adrien Bertrand]], [[Yvan Goll]], and [[Charles P\u00e9guy]].\n\n[[File:Louis Pergaud.jpg|thumb|left|Louis Pergaud]]\nThe French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Louis Pergaud]] considered himself a [[Pacifism|Pacifist]] and, at the outbreak of war in 1914, he tried in vain to register as a [[conscientious objector]]. Instead, he was conscripted into the [[French Army]] and sent to the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nOn 7 April 1915, Pergaud's regiment attacked the [[Imperial German Army]]'s trenches near [[Fresnes-en-Wo\u00ebvre]], during which he was wounded. Pergaud fell into [[barbed wire]], where he became trapped. Several hours later, German soldiers rescued him and other wounded French soldiers and took them to a temporary [[field hospital]] behind German lines. On the morning of April 8, 1915, Pergaud and many other [[POW]]s were killed by [[friendly fire]], when a French artillery barrage destroyed the hospital.\n\nThe [[Breton language]] poet and activist [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], a former Catholic seminarian who was best known by his [[Bardic name]] of ''Bleimor'', enlisted in the [[French Army]] on the outbreak of war in 1914. Like many others, Kalloc'h believed that France's war against Germany was a defense of civilization and [[Christianity]] and that it would lead to the resurrection of the Catholic Faith and the [[Breton language]] and [[Breton culture|culture]]. Ultimately, Kalloc'h, who wielded a sailor's axe in hand to hand combat in the trenches, was killed when a German shell landed near his dugout on April 10, 1917. His last poetry collection, ''Ar en Deulin'', was published postumously.\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Unter den Linden 4, Neue Wache.jpg|thumb|The [[Neo-Classical]] portal of the [[Neue Wache]] on [[Unter den Linden]] in [[Berlin]], which has been Germany's primary war memorial since 1931.]]\nGerman World War I poets include: [[Rudolf G. Binding]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[August Stramm]].\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1914, [[Gerrit Engelke]], a [[working class]] poet from [[Hanover]], was in neutral [[Denmark]]. He at first hesitated to return, but was ultimately forced to do so by financial pressures. He served in combat for four years, experiencing the battles of [[Langemarck]], [[Battle of St. Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]], D\u00fcnaberg, and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. In 1916, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for swimming across the flooded [[Yser River]]. Engelke was wounded in 1917 and, during his recovery, he became engaged to a war widow, but was forced to return to combat in May 1918. His friends attempted to have him transferred away from the firing line, much to Engelke's outrage, as he felt a deep loyalty to his brothers in arms. He was fatally injured in a successful British assault on October 11, 1918 and died the following day at a British [[field hospital]]. He had previously written, \"The greatest task which faces us after the war will be to forgive our enemy, who has, after all, been our neighbour on Earth since Creation.\"<ref> Tim Cross(1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 81.</ref> \n\nGerrit Engelke is best known for his [[anti-war]] poem ''An die Soldaten Des Grossen Krieges'' (\"To the Soldiers of the Great War\"), an poem in [[rhyme]]d [[dactylic hexameter]] modeled after the Neo-Classical odes of [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]]. In the ode, Engelke urges the soldiers of all the combatant nations to join hands together in universal brotherhood. An English translation exists by Patrick Bridgwater.\n\n[[File:Walter Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Walter Flex]]\n[[Walter Flex]], who is best known as the author of the war poem ''[[Wild Geese (song)|Wildg\u00e4nse rauschen durch die Nacht]]'', was a native of [[Eisenach]] and attended the [[University of Erlangen]] before the outbreak of war. After service on both the Eastern and Western Fronts, Flex was [[killed in action]] at [[Saaremaa]], [[Estonia]] during [[Operation Albion]] on October 17, 1917. His poems, which were very patriotic in nature, remained very popular until the 1970s.\n\n[[File:Lajos Tihanyi Yvan Goll 1927.jpg|thumb|left|Yvan Goll in 1927.]]\n[[Yvan Goll]], a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] poet from the disputed territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], wrote bilingually in both German and French. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Goll fled to [[Switzerland]] to evade [[conscription]] into the [[Imperial German Army]]. While there, he wrote many [[anti-war]] poems, in which he sought to promote better understanding between Germany and France. His most famous poem is ''[[Requiem f\u00fcr die Todte in Europa]]'' (''[[Requiem for the Dead of Europe]]'').\n\n[[File:Stefan George 1910 Foto Jakob Hilsdorf.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan George in 1910.]]\n[[Stefan George]], a German poet who had done his literary [[apprenticeship]] with the French [[Symbolist]] poets in [[Paris]], still had many friends in [[France]] and viewed the Great War as disastrous. In his 1916 [[anti-war]] poem ''Der Krieg'' (\"The War\"), George attacked the horrors that soldiers of all nations were facing in the trenches. In the poem, George famously declared, \"The ancient god of battles is no more.\"\n\n[[File:RJSorge1.jpg|thumb|Reinhard Johannes Sorge on [[Furlough]] in [[Berlin]], 1915]]\n[[Reinhard Sorge]], the [[Kleist Prize]] winning author of the [[Expressionist]] play ''Der Bettler'', saw the coming of the war as an idealistic recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He wrote many poems, many of them in experimental forms, about both his Catholic Faith and what he was witnessing as a soldier with the [[Imperial German Army]] in France. Shortly before being [[mortally wounded]] by a grenade during the [[Battle of the Somme]], Sorge wrote to his wife expressing a belief that what he called, \"the Anglo-French Offensive\" was going to succeed in overrunning German defenses. Sorge died in a [[field hospital]] at [[Ablaincourt-Pressoir|Ablaincourt]] on July 20, 1916. Sorge's wife only learned of his death when a letter, in which she informed her husband that he had gotten her [[pregnant]] during his last [[furlough]], was returned to her as undeliverable.\n[[Image:Het treurende ouderpaar - K\u00e4the Kolwitz.JPG|thumb|left|The sculptures of ''The Grieving Parents'' by [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], which date from the [[1930s]], stand vigil over the [[Vladslo German war cemetery]] in [[Belgium]].]]\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:BASA-1221K-1-48-11.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers resting in a trench]]\nThere were also war poets from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\n[[Franz Janowitz]], a Jewish poet from the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], had enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a one year volunteer in 1913. He was wounded by machine gun fire during an assault on Monte Rombon and died of his wounds on November 4, 1917. According to Jeremy Adler, \"Franz Janowitz conflicts with the received idea of the best German war poets. Neither [[wikt:realistic|realistic]], nor ironic, nor properly [[expressionist]]ic, while he excoriated the battlefield that the whole world had become, he still preserved a Faith in nobility, innocence, and song. Forced into maturity by the war, his poetic voice never lost a certain childlike note - indeed, in some of his best poems, naivety and wisdom coexist to an almost paradoxical degree. Such poetry was fired by a vision of a transcendental realm that lay beyond conflict, but never sought to exclude death. His 25 years, the last four of which were spent in the Army, scarcely left him time to develop a wholly independent voice, but his work displays an increasing mastery of form and deepening of vision. His small ''oeuvre'' consists of ''Novellen'', essays, aphorisms, and a handful of the best German poems connected with the Great War.\"<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 109.</ref>\n\n[[File:Georg Trakl.jpg|thumb|left|Georg Trakl.]]\n[[Georg Trakl]], an [[Expressionist]] poet from [[Salzburg]], enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as a [[medical officer]] in 1914. He personally witnessed the [[Battle of Gr\u00f3dek (1914)|Battle of Gr\u00f3dek]], fought in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in which the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] suffered a bloody defeat at the hands of the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. After the battle, Trakl was left in command of a [[field hospital]] filled with wounded soldiers and [[psychosis|mentally collapsed]] from the ensuing strain.\n\nOne evening following the battle Trakl ran outside and attempted to shoot himself in order to escape from the screams of the wounded and the dying. He was prevented from doing so and was sent to a [[mental hospital]]. On the night of November 3-4, 1914, Georg Trakl died in a military hospital in [[Cracow]] from an overdose of [[cocaine]]. Trakl's [[batman (military)|batman]], however, who was the last person to whom the poet spoke, believed that the overdose was an accident, rather than [[suicide]].<ref> Tim Cross (1988), ''The Lost Voices of World War I'', page 118.</ref>  Georg Trakl is best known for the poem ''[[Grodek]]''.\n\n[[G\u00e9za Gy\u00f3ni]], a Hungarian poet, enlisted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1914. The poems he wrote as a soldier began with optimism, but grew increasingly pessimistic as the war went on. Gy\u00f3ni was ultimately captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] after the [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915. After being held in atrocious conditions as a [[Prisoner of War]], he died in a POW camp at [[Krasnoyarsk]], in [[Siberia]] on June 25, 1917.

(London: Lawrence & Wishart, 2006)</ref> \n\nOn the Nationalist side, the most famous English language poet of the Spanish Civil War remains [[South African people|South African]] poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]. Campbell was living in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] with his family when hostilities started. As a recent convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Campbell was horrified to witness the systematic [[religious persecution]] and [[Red Terror (Spain)|mass murder of Catholics]] by the Republican forces. A particularly chilling moment for Campbell was when he came across the bodies of Toledo's Carmelite monks, whom he had befriended, after Republican forces had subjected them to [[summary execution|execution without trial]]. The monks' executioner's had then written in blood above their bodies, \"Thus strikes the [[CHEKA]].\" According to Campbell's biographer, [[Joseph Pearce]], and his daughters Anna and Tess, Campbell's subsequently pro-Nationalist stance has caused him to be unfairly labeled as a [[Fascist]] and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.\n\nThe best [[Spanish language]] poets of the Civil War are [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] and the Machado brothers. [[Antonio  Machado]] wrote a poem to honor the [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist]] General [[Enrique L\u00edster]],<ref name=\"A L\u00edster\">''[http://www.rafaelrobles.com/webquests/pazperpetua/documentospazperpetua/alistermachado.htm A L\u00edster, jefe en los ej\u00e9rcitos del Ebro]'', Antonio Machado, June 1938.</ref> and died a [[refugee]] in [[France]] after the defeat of the Republic. Meanwhile, his brother, [[Manuel Machado y Ruiz|Manuel Machado]], dedicated a poem to the [[saber]] of the Nationalist Generalissimo [[Francisco Franco]].\n\n[[Chilean people|Chilean]] poet [[Pablo Neruda]] became intensely politicised for the first time during the Spanish Civil War. As a result of his experiences in Spain, Neruda became an ardent [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist]] and remained one for the rest of his life. The radical leftist politics of his literary friends were contributing factors, but the most important [[catalyst]] was the abduction and [[summary execution|execution without trial]] of the Republican poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] by Nationalist soldiers.<ref Name=\"Tarn16\">Tarn (1975) p. 16</ref> By means of his speeches and writings, Neruda threw his support behind the [[Second Spanish Republic]], publishing the collection ''Espa\u00f1a en el coraz\u00f3n'' (''Spain in Our Hearts'') in 1938. He lost his post as Chilean [[consul]] due to his refusal to remain politically neutral.<ref name=\"Tarn16\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n{{Category see also|World War II poets}}\n\n===England===\nBy [[World War II]] the role of \"war poet\" was so well-established in the public mind, and it was anticipated that the outbreak of war in 1939 would produce a literary response equal to that of the First World War. The [[Times Literary Supplement]] went so far as to pose the question in 1940: \"Where are the war-poets?\"<ref name=Blythe>{{cite book|last=Blythe|first=Ronald|title=Components of the Scene|year=1966|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth}}</ref> [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and [[Keith Douglas]] are the standard critical choices amongst British war poets of this time.<ref>[http://www.lrbshop.co.uk/collected-poems_4060.html London Review]; [[Andrew Sinclair]], ''The War Decade: An Anthology Of The 1940s''.

MacLean's time in the firing line ended when he was severely wounded at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. \n\nMacLean's most famous Gaelic war poem is ''Ruweisat Ridge'', which relates his thoughts on seeing a dead German soldier in North Africa. In the poem, MacLean ponders what role the dead man may have played in Nazi atrocities against both [[German Jews]] and members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. MacLean concludes, however, by saying that whatever the German soldier may or may not have done, he showed no pleasure in his death upon Ruweisat Ridge.\n\n===United States===\nThe horror of World War I was so deeply ingrained in the [[American people]] that [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s efforts to bring the United States into the war against [[Nazi Germany]] were very unpopular. The [[America First Committee]], of which [[Charles Lindbergh]] was the spokesman, and the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] were both organizing protests against Roosevelt's foreign policies. Opposition to entering the war vanished, however, when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. \n\nAlthough the [[Second World War]] is not usually thought of as a poet's war, there were American war poets.\n\nFuture [[U.S. Poet Laureate]] [[Richard Wilbur]] served as a [[Sergeant]] with the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th U.S. Infantry Division]] during the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the Allied Landings in Southern France and in the final invasion of [[Nazi Germany]]. During his war service and the decades that followed, Richard Wilbur wrote many war poems. \n\nOne of Wilbur's best known war poems is ''Tywater'', about the combat death of Corporal Lloyd Tywater, a former rodeo cowboy with a talent for rope tricks, knife throwing, and shooting swallows out of the sky with a pistol. \n\nAnother famous war poem by Richard Wilbur is ''First Snow in Alsace'', which lyrically describes the horrors of a recent battlefield in [[Occupied France]] being covered up by the beautiful sight of new fallen snow.\n\nIn an interview for the documentary ''[[The Muse of Fire]]'', Wilbur commented that there was a great difference between the war poets of [[World War I]] and those of [[World War II]]. Wilbur explained that, unlike [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Wilfred Owen]], [[World War II]] poets believed themselves to be fighting a [[just war]] and that [[Nazi Germany]], [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], and [[Imperial Japan]] were terrible enemies which needed to be confronted and destroyed. He did add that many World War II poets, including himself, felt sympathy for the plight of [[conscientious objector]]s.\n\nAmerican poet [[Dunstan Thompson]] began publishing his poems while serving as a soldier in the European Theater during World War II. Thompson's poems depict military service through the eyes of a [[homosexual]], who is engaged in casual encounters with soldiers and sailors in Blitzed London. \n\n[[Karl Shapiro]], a stylish writer with a commendable regard for his craft,<ref>Scannell, Vernon ''Not Without Glory'' Woburn Press , London 1976 {{ISBN|0713000945}}</ref>  wrote poetry in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] while he served there during World War II. His collection ''V-Letter and Other Poems'', written while Shapiro was stationed in [[New Guinea]], was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in [[1945 in literature|1945]], while Shapiro was still in the military. Shapiro was American Poet Laureate in 1946 and 1947. (At the time this title was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress which was changed by Congress in 1985 to [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]].). \n\nAlso, while serving in the U.S. Army, the American poet [[Randall Jarrell]] published his second book of poems, ''Little Friend, Little Friend'' (1945) based on his wartime experiences. The book includes one of Jarrell's best known war poems, \"[[The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner]].\" In his follow-up book, ''Losses'' (1948), he also focused on the war. The poet [[Robert Lowell]] stated publicly that he thought Jarrell had written \"the best poetry in English about the Second World War.\"<ref>Gilroy, Harry. \"Poets Honor Memory of Jarrell at Yale.\" ''The New York Times'' 1 March 1966.</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nDuring World War II, [[Anna Akhmatova]] witnessed the 900-day [[Siege of Leningrad]] and read her poems over the radio to encourage the city's defenders. In 1940, Akhmatova started her ''Poem without a Hero'', finishing a first draft in [[Tashkent]], but working on  \"The Poem\" for twenty years and considering it to be the major work of her life, dedicating it to \"the memory of its first audience \u2013 my friends and fellow citizens who perished in Leningrad during the siege\".<ref Name=\"Martin10\">Martin (2007) p. 10</ref> \n\nAfter the war, Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]] was stunned to see Akhmatova given a [[standing ovation]] by Russians who remembered her wartime broadcasts. Stalin gave orders to find out who organized the standing ovation and launched a campaign of [[blacklisting]] and defamation against the poetess, in which she was called, \"Half harlot, half nun.\"\n\nIn the 1974 poem ''[[Prussian Nights]]'', [[Soviet dissident]] [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], a former [[Captain]] in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]], graphically describes [[Soviet war crimes]] in [[East Prussia]]. The narrator, a [[Red Army]] officer, approves of his troops' looting and rapes against German civilians as revenge for [[German war crimes]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and he hopes to take part in the atrocities himself. The poem describes the [[gang-rape]] of a [[Poles|Polish]] woman whom the [[Red Army]] soldiers had mistaken for a [[German people|German]].<ref>Davies, Norman (1982) ''God's Playground. A History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, Vol. II, {{ISBN|0-231-12819-3}}</ref> According to a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Solzhenitsyn wrote the  poem in [[trochaic tetrameter]], \"in imitation of, and argument with the most famous Russian war poem, [[Aleksandr Tvardovsky]]'s ''[[Vasili Tyorkin]]''.\"<ref name =\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Proffer|first=Carl R.|author-link=Carl Ray Proffer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/solz-prussian.html|title=Russia in Prussia|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 August 1977|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Romania===\nThe [[Romania]]n-born poet [[Paul Celan]] wrote war poetry including \"[[Todesfuge]]\" (translated into English as \"Death Fugue\",<ref>e.g. [http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/death-fugue translation by Jerome Rothenburg] at poets.org website, accessed 1 July 2014</ref> and \"Fugue of Death\",<ref>e.g. [http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/fugue-death translation by Christopher Middleton] at poets.org, accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>) a German language poem written by probably around 1945 and first published in 1948. It is \"among Celan's most well-known and often-anthologized poems\".<ref>[http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/paul-celan \"Paul Celan\"], in poets.org website, accessed 1 July 2014; Duroche (1967), p. 472.</ref>  The is regarded as a \"masterful description of horror and death in a concentration camp\".<ref>Glenn (1972), p. 25.</ref> Celan was born to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Chernivtsi|Cernauti]], [[Romania]]; his parents were murdered during the [[Holocaust]], and Celan himself was a prisoner for a time in a [[concentration camp]].\n\n[[Tristan Tzara]] was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist, best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the [[French Resistance]] during World War II, and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against [[French war crimes]] in the [[Algerian War]].\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Ryuichi Tamura]] (1923\u201398) who served in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during World War II is a major Japanese war poet. Following the war, he \"helped begin a poetry magazine, ''The Waste Land''\" and those poets who contributed to it were \u201cthe Waste Land Poets.\u201d  The work of these writers was especially influenced by T. S. Eliot, [[Stephen Spender]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis|C. Day-Lewis]] and [[W. H. Auden]]. Tamura's first book of poems, ''Four Thousand Days and Nights'' was published in 1956.<ref>Voices of Education, \"WWII Japanese Poets [http://voiceseducation.org/category/tag/wwii-japanese-poet]</ref>\n\n[[Sadako Kurihara]] was living in [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945 and it was then \"that her life was transformed from being a shopkeeper to becoming one of Japan\u2019s most controversial poets. Her first major collection of poems, ''Black Eggs'', published in 1946\", but it was heavily censored by the American Occupation Forces Censor, because of how she dealt with the horrors following the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. Kurihara has also \"taken a stand on Japan\u2019s aggressive rule\" during the [[Japanese occupation of China|occupation of China]], \"the mistreatment of [[Koreans in Japan]], and the need for a world-wide ban on nuclear weapons\".<ref>Voices of Education, \"WWII Japanese Poets</ref>\n\n[[File:Tadamichi Kuribayashi.jpg|thumb|General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.]]\nGeneral [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], the overall commander of the Japanese forces during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], was a poet and former diplomat who had been assigned to [[Washington, D.C.]] during the [[Interwar Period]]. Having seen America's military and industrial power first hand, Kuribayashi opposed Prime Minister [[Hideki Tojo]]'s decision to attack Pearl Harbor, saying, \"The United States is the last country in the world Japan should fight.\" It was ultimately decided to assign Kuribayashi to the [[suicide mission]] of defending [[Iwo Jima]] in order to silence his criticisms of the war.\n\nOn 17 March 1945, the General sent his farewell message to Imperial Headquarters accompanied by three traditional [[death poem]]s in ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form. Both were, according to historian Kumiko Kakehashi, \"a subtle protest against the military command that so casually sent men out to die.\"<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxv''.</ref> \n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n:Unable to complete this heavy task for our country\nArrows and bullets all spent, so sad we fall.\n\n:But unless I smite the enemy,\nMy body cannot rot in the field.\nYea, I shall be born again seven times\nAnd grasp the sword in my hand.\n\n:When ugly weeds cover this island,\nMy sole thought shall be the Imperial Land.<ref>Kumiko Kakehashi, ''So Sad to Fall in Battle: An Account of War'', page ''xxiii''.</ref>\n</poem>\n\nThe poems and the message were heavily rewritten by Japanese military censors before being published and all [[anti-war]] sentiments were removed. Instead of describing the General and his soldiers as feeling \"sad\" to fall in battle, Japanese censors rewrote the poem to say that they died in [[Banzai charge]]s, which the General had forbidden on Iwo Jima as an unnecessary waste of his men's lives. The uncensored text of both the message and the poems were only published after the [[Surrender of Japan]].\n\n===Serbia===\nAmongst Serbian poets during World War II, the most notable is [[Desanka Maksimovi\u0107]]. She is well-known for \"''Krvava bajka''\" or \"Bloody Fairy Story\". The poem is about a group of schoolchildren who fell victim to the Nazis in 1941 in [[Kragujevac massacre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/desanka-maksimovic/krvava-bajka|title=Krvava bajka - Serbo-Croatian Poetry Translation|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Later wars==\n\n===American poets===\nThe [[Korean War]] produced the American war poets [[Rolando Hinojosa]] and [[William Wantling]].\n<ref>W.

Ehrhart, ''The Madness of It All: Essays in War, Literature and American Life'', (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2002) pp. 141\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe [[Vietnam war]] also produced war poets, including [[Michael Casey (poet)|Michael Casey]] whose d\u00e9but collection, ''Obscenities'', drew on his work as [[Military Police Corps (United States Army)|military police]] officer in Vietnam's Quang Nga province. The book won the 1972 [[Yale Younger Poets Award]]. Other prominent Vietnam War poets include [[W. D.

(Lubbock, Texas: Texas Tech University Press, 1989)</ref>\n\nAt the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, American poet [[Richard Wilbur]] composed ''A Miltonic Sonnet for Mr. Johnson on His Refusal of Peter Hurd's Official Portrait''. In a clear cut case of \"criticism from the Right\", Wilbur compares U.S. President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] with [[Thomas Jefferson]] and finds the former to be greatly wanting. Commenting that Jefferson \"would have wept to see small nations dread/ The imposition of our cattle brand,\" and that in Jefferson's term, \"no army's blood was shed\", Wilbur urges President Johnson to seriously consider how history will judge him and his Administration.\n\nMost recently, the Iraq War has produced war poets including [[Brian Turner (American poet)|Brian Turner]] whose d\u00e9but collection, ''Here, Bullet'', is based on his experience as an infantry team leader with the 3rd [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team]] from November 2003 until November 2004 in [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

It lies near the right bank of the [[Buz\u0103u River]], between the south-eastern curvature of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the lowlands of [[B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain]].\n\nBuz\u0103u is a railway hub in south-eastern Romania, where railways that link Bucharest to Moldavia and Transylvania to the Black Sea coast meet. [[DN2]], a segment of [[European route E85]] crosses the city. Buz\u0103u's proximity to trade routes helped it develop its role as a commerce hub in older days, and as an industrial centre during the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Buz\u0103u was a [[market town]] and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[episcopal see]] in [[Wallachia]]. It faced a period of repeated destruction during the 17th and 18th centuries, nowadays symbolized on the city seal by the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix bird]]. In the 19th century, after the end of that era, the city began to recover. The economy underwent industrialization, Buz\u0103u became a railway hub, and public education became available. At this time, the Communal Palace, the city's landmark building, and Cr\u00e2ng Park, the main recreational area, were built. The communist regime after World War II brought forced industrialization and the tripling of the city's population. Some of the factories open at the time are still functioning within the framework of market economy.\n\nThere are no universities based in Buz\u0103u, and only a few universities from other cities have remote learning facilities here. The main educational institutions here are B.P. Hasdeu high-school (where Nobel laureate George Emil Palade studied) and Mihai Eminescu high-school. The city has a number of other secondary schools, in addition to elementary schools. The Vasile Voiculescu County Library and Buz\u0103u County Museum are based in the city. The latter also manages an ethnography exhibit in the city, as well as the Vasile Voiculescu memorial house in [[P\u00e2rscov]] and the amber exhibit at [[Col\u021bi]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city is named after [[Buz\u0103u (river)|the nearby river]]. In turn, the river is mentioned under the name {{lang|el|\u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2}} (''Mouseos'') in a document written in Greek and dated 376 AD, recounting the martyrdom of [[Sabbas the Goth]]. Historian [[Vasile P\u00e2rvan]] thought that this name is a Greek misspelling of the Thracian word ''Bouzeos'' (by losing a ''\u03c0'' from the ''\u039c\u03c0'' group, which is pronounced like a Latin ''B''). He suggested that the name comes from the Thracian root ''Buzes'', with the addition of the  ''-eu'' suffix, a form of the Greek-Latin suffix ''-aios''.<ref>Petcu, p. 19</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Buz\u0103u}}\n[[File:Vue_de_la_ville_de_Bouzeou.jpg|left|thumb|Buz\u0103u in early 20th century]][[File:1916_-_Albert_Reich_-_Buzau,_palatul_administrativ_p55.jpg|left|thumb|German occupation troops, 1916]]The written history of the city begins with that of [[\u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103|Wallachia]].

The old market town tradition is still preserved in the ''Dr\u0103gaica'' fair, held every June around [[Midsummer]], bringing together small producers and merchants from diverse regions of Romania.\n\nThe agricultural reform during [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] led some of the Bulgarian gardners to rent in 1897 \u0219i 1898 some land acquired by the state from the bishopric. The developed a distribution network for their produce both in Buz\u0103u, and in other nearby cities such as [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Ploie\u0219ti]] or [[R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat]]. Their activity became even more lucrative after the land reform of 1921.<ref>Petcu, 2002, p. 134</ref>\n\nAfter the period of repeated invasions and destruction ended in the 19th century, the economy began to industrialize as well. Towards the end of that century, the development of a Romanian railway network made Buz\u0103u one of its important hubs and pushed the small craftsmen's shops to evolve into industrial installations. The first such facility was the ''Garoflid mill'', open in 1883, that worked also as a [[Textile|cloth]] factory.<ref name=\"petcu1353\">Petcu, 2002, p. 135</ref> \u00cen 1894, an [[Petrol|oil]] refinery of the ''Saturn'' society was built; this refinery was to function for 50 years.\n\nAfter a dramatic nationwide decrease caused by the [[First World War]] (the 1919 output was a quarter of the one in 1913<ref name=\"petcu1353\" />), the industrial development picked up steam during the interbellum. One of the main components of the local industry was [[Mill (grinding)|milling]]. The first industrial mill in the city, ''Garoflid'', renamed ''Zangopol'' after its new owner, had reached a capital of 5 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in 1928 and, 30 de million in 1938, while the company that operated it had around 100 employees.<ref name=\"petcu1363\">Petcu, 2002, p. 136</ref> Another business started at this time was ''Metalurgica \u0219i Turn\u0103torie \u2013 S.A.'' (Metallurgy and Foundry), founded in 1928 with a capital of over 9 million lei. Although it had an initially difficult period, as it was closed during the [[Great Depression]], it was reopened in 1933, only to be closed again in 1940 and 1944, during World War II.<ref name=\"Buz\u0103u p. 255\" />\n[[File:1970_Intreprinderea_de_geamuri_Buzau.JPG|left|thumb|Buz\u0103u window factory in 1970]]\nAfter [[World War II]], on 11 June 1948 all factories were requisitioned by the Communist government, who also began a program of forced industrialization, even though some of the industries that were being developed were unfit to the region.<ref name=\"petcu1373\">Petcu, 2002, p. 137</ref> In 1965, the 318 [[Hectare|ha]] Buz\u0103u South industrial platform began to be built around the old location of the ''Saturn'' refinery, blown up during the war. It was the location of the city's most important factories that were developed at the time: the Steel Wire and Steel Wire Products Enterprise (after 1990, ''Ductil''), the Railway Machinery Enterprise (after 1990, ''[[VAE Apcarom|Apcarom]]''), ''Metalurgica'' (the one founded in 1928), the Glass and Windows Factory (after 1991, ''[[Gerom Buz\u0103u|Gerom S.A.]]'').\n[[File:RO_BZ_Contactoare.jpg|right|thumb|The \"Contactoare\" electrical relays factory in Buz\u0103u]]\nOther facilities were located in other parts of the city, such as the Contactors Enterprise, in the North-East, and the Plastic Works (after 1990, ''[[Romcarbon|Romcarbon S.A.]]'') in the North.\n\nDespite the forced industrialization, Buz\u0103u was spared from becoming dependent on a single industry, and there was no single point of failure for the city's economy. According to the new law of commerce of 1990, that came after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of Communism]], these factories were organised as state-owned companies, and were privatised. Most of them survived the transition to a [[market economy]], as many of them thus became viable.\n\n=== Present economy ===\nCurrently, the largest Buz\u0103u-based company is Romet, a [[holding company]] made up of multiple firms that produse isolation materials for water and gas pipes, water filters, fire extinguishers and other related products.

The city was found to be in competition with larger cities for the labor force from other counties, a feature it shares with [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]].

Buz\u0103u is the second city (closely after [[Ploie\u0219ti]], a city with almost double the population), by the number of employees in Bucharest coming from other cities between 1991 and 2011; the survey points out that this has been a disadvantage, but might become an opportunity in the future.<ref>{{Citat web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448771499322731333/pdf/116400-ROMANIAN-REVISED-PUBLIC-Magnet-Cities-Migration-and-Commuting-in-Romania-RO.pdf|title=Ora\u0219e-magnet.

It lies near the right bank of the [[Buz\u0103u River]], between the south-eastern curvature of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the lowlands of [[B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain]].\n\nBuz\u0103u is a railway hub in south-eastern Romania, where railways that link Bucharest to Moldavia and Transylvania to the Black Sea coast meet. [[DN2]], a segment of [[European route E85]] crosses the city. Buz\u0103u's proximity to trade routes helped it develop its role as a commerce hub in older days, and as an industrial centre during the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Buz\u0103u was a [[market town]] and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[episcopal see]] in [[Wallachia]]. It faced a period of repeated destruction during the 17th and 18th centuries, nowadays symbolized on the city seal by the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix bird]]. In the 19th century, after the end of that era, the city began to recover. The economy underwent industrialization, Buz\u0103u became a railway hub, and public education became available. At this time, the Communal Palace, the city's landmark building, and Cr\u00e2ng Park, the main recreational area, were built. The communist regime after World War II brought forced industrialization and the tripling of the city's population. Some of the factories open at the time are still functioning within the framework of market economy.\n\nThere are no universities based in Buz\u0103u, and only a few universities from other cities have remote learning facilities here. The main educational institutions here are B.P. Hasdeu high-school (where Nobel laureate George Emil Palade studied) and Mihai Eminescu high-school. The city has a number of other secondary schools, in addition to elementary schools. The Vasile Voiculescu County Library and Buz\u0103u County Museum are based in the city. The latter also manages an ethnography exhibit in the city, as well as the Vasile Voiculescu memorial house in [[P\u00e2rscov]] and the amber exhibit at [[Col\u021bi]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city is named after [[Buz\u0103u (river)|the nearby river]]. In turn, the river is mentioned under the name {{lang|el|\u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2}} (''Mouseos'') in a document written in Greek and dated 376 AD, recounting the martyrdom of [[Sabbas the Goth]]. Historian [[Vasile P\u00e2rvan]] thought that this name is a Greek misspelling of the Thracian word ''Bouzeos'' (by losing a ''\u03c0'' from the ''\u039c\u03c0'' group, which is pronounced like a Latin ''B''). He suggested that the name comes from the Thracian root ''Buzes'', with the addition of the  ''-eu'' suffix, a form of the Greek-Latin suffix ''-aios''.<ref>Petcu, p. 19</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Buz\u0103u}}\n[[File:Vue_de_la_ville_de_Bouzeou.jpg|left|thumb|Buz\u0103u in early 20th century]][[File:1916_-_Albert_Reich_-_Buzau,_palatul_administrativ_p55.jpg|left|thumb|German occupation troops, 1916]]The written history of the city begins with that of [[\u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103|Wallachia]].

The old market town tradition is still preserved in the ''Dr\u0103gaica'' fair, held every June around [[Midsummer]], bringing together small producers and merchants from diverse regions of Romania.\n\nThe agricultural reform during [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] led some of the Bulgarian gardners to rent in 1897 \u0219i 1898 some land acquired by the state from the bishopric. The developed a distribution network for their produce both in Buz\u0103u, and in other nearby cities such as [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Ploie\u0219ti]] or [[R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat]]. Their activity became even more lucrative after the land reform of 1921.<ref>Petcu, 2002, p. 134</ref>\n\nAfter the period of repeated invasions and destruction ended in the 19th century, the economy began to industrialize as well. Towards the end of that century, the development of a Romanian railway network made Buz\u0103u one of its important hubs and pushed the small craftsmen's shops to evolve into industrial installations. The first such facility was the ''Garoflid mill'', open in 1883, that worked also as a [[Textile|cloth]] factory.<ref name=\"petcu1353\">Petcu, 2002, p. 135</ref> \u00cen 1894, an [[Petrol|oil]] refinery of the ''Saturn'' society was built; this refinery was to function for 50 years.\n\nAfter a dramatic nationwide decrease caused by the [[First World War]] (the 1919 output was a quarter of the one in 1913<ref name=\"petcu1353\" />), the industrial development picked up steam during the interbellum. One of the main components of the local industry was [[Mill (grinding)|milling]]. The first industrial mill in the city, ''Garoflid'', renamed ''Zangopol'' after its new owner, had reached a capital of 5 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in 1928 and, 30 de million in 1938, while the company that operated it had around 100 employees.<ref name=\"petcu1363\">Petcu, 2002, p. 136</ref> Another business started at this time was ''Metalurgica \u0219i Turn\u0103torie \u2013 S.A.'' (Metallurgy and Foundry), founded in 1928 with a capital of over 9 million lei. Although it had an initially difficult period, as it was closed during the [[Great Depression]], it was reopened in 1933, only to be closed again in 1940 and 1944, during World War II.<ref name=\"Buz\u0103u p. 255\" />\n[[File:1970_Intreprinderea_de_geamuri_Buzau.JPG|left|thumb|Buz\u0103u window factory in 1970]]\nAfter [[World War II]], on 11 June 1948 all factories were requisitioned by the Communist government, who also began a program of forced industrialization, even though some of the industries that were being developed were unfit to the region.<ref name=\"petcu1373\">Petcu, 2002, p. 137</ref> In 1965, the 318 [[Hectare|ha]] Buz\u0103u South industrial platform began to be built around the old location of the ''Saturn'' refinery, blown up during the war. It was the location of the city's most important factories that were developed at the time: the Steel Wire and Steel Wire Products Enterprise (after 1990, ''Ductil''), the Railway Machinery Enterprise (after 1990, ''[[VAE Apcarom|Apcarom]]''), ''Metalurgica'' (the one founded in 1928), the Glass and Windows Factory (after 1991, ''[[Gerom Buz\u0103u|Gerom S.A.]]'').\n[[File:RO_BZ_Contactoare.jpg|right|thumb|The \"Contactoare\" electrical relays factory in Buz\u0103u]]\nOther facilities were located in other parts of the city, such as the Contactors Enterprise, in the North-East, and the Plastic Works (after 1990, ''[[Romcarbon|Romcarbon S.A.]]'') in the North.\n\nDespite the forced industrialization, Buz\u0103u was spared from becoming dependent on a single industry, and there was no single point of failure for the city's economy. According to the new law of commerce of 1990, that came after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of Communism]], these factories were organised as state-owned companies, and were privatised. Most of them survived the transition to a [[market economy]], as many of them thus became viable.\n\n=== Present economy ===\nCurrently, the largest Buz\u0103u-based company is Romet, a [[holding company]] made up of multiple firms that produse isolation materials for water and gas pipes, water filters, fire extinguishers and other related products.

Buz\u0103u is the second city (closely after [[Ploie\u0219ti]], a city with almost double the population), by the number of employees in Bucharest coming from other cities between 1991 and 2011; the survey points out that this has been a disadvantage, but might become an opportunity in the future.<ref>{{Citat web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448771499322731333/pdf/116400-ROMANIAN-REVISED-PUBLIC-Magnet-Cities-Migration-and-Commuting-in-Romania-RO.pdf|title=Ora\u0219e-magnet.

In retrospect, the BWV numbering seems somewhat arbitrary as a grouping of the Bach motets: recent scholarship includes more works among the motets. However, ''Lobet den Herrn'' has often been recorded with others from BWV 225-229. It is the only one of the set to be scored for four voices. It is also unusual in that (lightly scored) instrumental accompaniment is specified.<ref name=\"ml\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n=== 19th century editions ===\nIt was first published in 1821.
