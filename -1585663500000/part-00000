The station broadcasts nationwide. It is owned by the country's public broadcaster, [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC]]\n.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://pindula.co.zw/Zimbabwe_Broadcasting_Corporation|newspaper=Pindula}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the country, television was introduced in 1960, making it the second country after [[Nigeria]] to launch such services in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] \n<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5sZBAQAAIAAJ&dq=rhodesia+television+rtv+1960&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=welensky ''EBU Review: Programmes, Administration, Law, Volume 71''], Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1962, page 12</ref> and the first in [[Southern Africa]]. It was operated by a private company called Rhodesian Television (RTV) with its major shareholders being [[South Africa]]n companies.\n\nRTV was taken over by the government and became part of the then state broadcaster, Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC) in 1976.\n\nTelevision was mainly accessible in major cities of the country and mostly to the white population. Soon after the launch in 1960, television became available in [[Salisbury]] now [[Harare]] and months later became available in [[Bulawayo]]. Back then, the station was broadcasting in black and white until 1982, when it upgraded to full colour using [[PAL-B|PAL B]] system.\n\nAfter the country's independence on 18 April 1980,<ref>[http://www.theindependent.co.zw/2012/02/16/muckraker-zbc-has-taken-over-the-rbcs-mantle/ 'MuckRaker: ZBC has taken over the RBC's mantle'], ''[[Zimbabwe Independent]]'', 16 February 2012</ref> RTV became ZBC TV and RBC became [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC]]. This followed after the country changed its name from [[Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] to Independent [[Zimbabwe]]. The station is sometimes called ZTV, abbreviation for Zimbabwe Television, a name that was officially used in the 2000s.\n\nIn the late 90s, the country's main opposition party [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai|MDC]] led by [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] was launched.  This saw the majority of the opposition supporters, local independent media houses, non governmental organisations and international media monitors accusing the state broadcaster for only reporting biased news favouring the ruling [[ZANU PF]].\n\n==Other TV stations==\nIn July 1998, '''Joy TV''', a private TV station was launched in the capital, but was later closed down on 31 May 2002 <ref>[https://www.pambazuka.org/security-icts/zimbabwe-curtain-comes-down-joy-tv Curtain comes down on Joy TV], ''Pamabazuka'', 6 June 2002</ref> when ZBC refused to renew its licence. In December 2018, ZBC announced the return of Joy TV.<ref>[http://www.zbc.co.zw/joy-tv-returns/ Joy TV retuns], ''[[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC News]]'', 12 December 2018</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ZBC announced a new TV channel called '''National Television''' or NTV, a brainchild of the then information minister, [[Jonathan Moyo]] and was said that it will be broadcasting from Montrose Studios in Bulawayo. The launch of the station was delayed despite the fact that the transmitter was already installed. In 2005, Minister Moyo was fired and the project collapsed. In 2015 when he was reappointed as the information minister, Moyo promised to revive the NTV project but that never happened.\n\nOn 1 May 2010, ZBC reported the successful launch of another TV channel called '''Channel 2'''.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201004130289.html Zimbabwe: ZBC to Launch Channel Two], ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]]'', 13 April 2010</ref> The TV channel transmitted on 199.5&nbsp;MHz within an 80&nbsp;km (50 mile) radius of Harare. The station was later closed in 2015.<ref>[https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2015/08/12/zbc-fires-hundreds-closes-tv-station ZBC fires hundreds, closes TV station], ''[[Daily News (Zimbabwe)|Daily News]]'', 12 August 2015</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n\n===General entertainment and news===\n\n75% of the broadcast content is locally produced. International and regional content from the neighbouring [[South Africa]], [[United States of America|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]], [[Korea]] is also available.\n\nThe news covered are mainly local and partly regional and international. ''News Hour'' is the hour-long news bulletin that is broadcast daily from 8 PM. ''Nhau / Indaba'' is another news bulletin that is split between [[Shona language|Shona]] (''Nhau'') and [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] (''Indaba'') with each receiving 30 minutes time slot. ''Good Morning Zimbabwe'' is the daily morning news bulletin then there is also ''Lunch Time News''.\n\nOther popular TV shows include the ''Ezomgido'', a local and regional musical show, ''Coke on the Beat'' which is a pop musical show, ''Studio 263'', the country's first soap opera and other various local shows including current affairs and gospel shows.\n\nIconic locally produced content include;\n*Mukadota\n*Ezomgido\n*Stitsha\n*Kukhulwa Kokuphela\n*Tiriparwendo\n*Studio 263\n*Amakorokoza\n*Sinjalo\n*Timmy naBonzo\n*Gringo\n\n===Sports===\n\nThe station also broadcasts various live sports tournaments from around the country and some major tournaments around the world, including the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Olympics]] and the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] (AFCON).\n\nDue to lack of finances which is believed to be caused by poor management and the corrupt board, the station is struggling to broadcast locally loved sport events like the [[Premier League]], [[UEFA Champions League]] and many others.\n\nMany local viewers are complaining about the station's poor broadcasting standard and are ditching it for foreign content distributors like [[Netflix]] and [[DStv]].\n\n==Programmes==\n===Current===\n====Imported Programmes====\n=====Children's programming=====\n*''[[Dino Dan]]''\n*''[[Raggs]]''\n\n=====Animated=====\n*''[[The Adventures of Chuck and

It is owned by the country's public broadcaster, [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC]]\n.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://pindula.co.zw/Zimbabwe_Broadcasting_Corporation|newspaper=Pindula}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the country, television was introduced in 1960, making it the second country after [[Nigeria]] to launch such services in the [[Sub Saharan Africa]] \n<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5sZBAQAAIAAJ&dq=rhodesia+television+rtv+1960&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=welensky ''EBU Review: Programmes, Administration, Law, Volume 71''], Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1962, page 12</ref> and the first in [[Southern Africa]]. It was operated by a private company called Rhodesian Television (RTV) with its major shareholders being [[South Africa]]n companies.\n\nRTV was taken over by the government and became part of the then state broadcaster, Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC) in 1976.\n\nTelevision was mainly accessible in major cities of the country and mostly to the white population. Soon after the launch in 1960, television became available in [[Salisbury]] now [[Harare]] and months later became available in [[Bulawayo]]. Back then, the station was broadcasting in black and white until 1982, when it upgraded to full colour using [[PAL-B|PAL B]] system.\n\nAfter the country's independence on 18 April 1980,<ref>[http://www.theindependent.co.zw/2012/02/16/muckraker-zbc-has-taken-over-the-rbcs-mantle/ 'MuckRaker: ZBC has taken over the RBC's mantle'], ''[[Zimbabwe Independent]]'', 16 February 2012</ref> RTV became ZBC TV and RBC became [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC]]. This followed after the country changed its name from [[Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] to Independent [[Zimbabwe]]. The station is sometimes called ZTV, abbreviation for Zimbabwe Television, a name that was officially used in the 2000s.\n\nIn the late 90s, the country's main opposition party [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai|MDC]] led by [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] was launched.  This saw the majority of the opposition supporters, local independent media houses, non governmental organisations and international media monitors accusing the state broadcaster for only reporting biased news favouring the ruling [[ZANU PF]].\n\n==Other TV stations==\nIn July 1998, '''Joy TV''', a private TV station was launched in the capital, but was later closed down on 31 May 2002 <ref>[https://www.pambazuka.org/security-icts/zimbabwe-curtain-comes-down-joy-tv Curtain comes down on Joy TV], ''Pamabazuka'', 6 June 2002</ref> when ZBC refused to renew its licence. In December 2018, ZBC announced the return of Joy TV.<ref>[http://www.zbc.co.zw/joy-tv-returns/ Joy TV retuns], ''[[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|ZBC News]]'', 12 December 2018</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ZBC announced a new TV channel called '''National Television''' or NTV, a brainchild of the then information minister, [[Jonathan Moyo]] and was said that it will be broadcasting from Montrose Studios in Bulawayo. The launch of the station was delayed despite the fact that the transmitter was already installed. In 2005, Minister Moyo was fired and the project collapsed. In 2015 when he was reappointed as the information minister, Moyo promised to revive the NTV project but that never happened.\n\nOn 1 May 2010, ZBC reported the successful launch of another TV channel called '''Channel 2'''.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201004130289.html Zimbabwe: ZBC to Launch Channel Two], ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]]'', 13 April 2010</ref> The TV channel transmitted on 199.5&nbsp;MHz within an 80&nbsp;km (50 mile) radius of Harare. The station was later closed in 2015.<ref>[https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2015/08/12/zbc-fires-hundreds-closes-tv-station ZBC fires hundreds, closes TV station], ''[[Daily News (Zimbabwe)|Daily News]]'', 12 August 2015</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n\n===General entertainment and news===\n\n75% of the broadcast content is locally produced. International and regional content from the neighbouring [[South Africa]], [[United States of America|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]], [[Korea]] is also available.\n\nThe news covered are mainly local and partly regional and international. ''News Hour'' is the hour-long news bulletin that is broadcast daily from 8 PM. ''Nhau / Indaba'' is another news bulletin that is split between [[Shona language|Shona]] (''Nhau'') and [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] (''Indaba'') with each receiving 30 minutes time slot. ''Good Morning Zimbabwe'' is the daily morning news bulletin then there is also ''Lunch Time News''.\n\nOther popular TV shows include the ''Ezomgido'', a local and regional musical show, ''Coke on the Beat'' which is a pop musical show, ''Studio 263'', the country's first soap opera and other various local shows including current affairs and gospel shows.\n\nIconic locally produced content include;\n*Mukadota\n*Ezomgido\n*Stitsha\n*Kukhulwa Kokuphela\n*Tiriparwendo\n*Studio 263\n*Amakorokoza\n*Sinjalo\n*Timmy naBonzo\n*Gringo\n\n===Sports===\n\nThe station also broadcasts various live sports tournaments from around the country and some major tournaments around the world, including the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Olympics]] and the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] (AFCON).\n\nDue to lack of finances which is believed to be caused by poor management and the corrupt board, the station is struggling to broadcast locally loved sport events like the [[Premier League]], [[UEFA Champions League]] and many others.\n\nMany local viewers are complaining about the station's poor broadcasting standard and are ditching it for foreign content distributors like [[Netflix]] and [[DStv]].\n\n===Imported Programmes===\n====Current====\n'''Children's programming'''\n*''[[Dino Dan]]''\n*''[[Raggs]]''\n\n'''Animated'''\n*''[[The Adventures of Chuck and Friends]]''\n*''[[Ben 10:

The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' first appeared as '''''Sam T\u00e2n''''' (''Fireman Sam'' in Welsh) on [[S4C]] in 1987, and at the same time on [[BBC One]]. The original series finished in 1994, and a new series that expanded the character cast commenced in 2005. The series was also shown in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] in Scotland. The series was sold to over 40 countries and has been used across the UK to promote [[fire safety]].\n\n==Development==\nThe original idea came about from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England \u2013 Dave Gingell and [[David Jones (writer)|David Jones]] after [[Commission (art)|purchasing]] the [[stop motion]] animation drawn by artist Anthony Miller and [[Will Vinton]]. They approached [[Mike Young (producer)|Mike Young]], creator of ''[[SuperTed]]'', in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], Wales, and asked them to further develop their concept. The idea was then brought to S4C's Director of Animation, Chris Grace, who had previously commissioned ''SuperTed'', saw potential in the idea and commissioned the series. The characters and storylines were created by Rob Lee, an illustrator from Cardiff, and the programme was made using [[stop motion]]. It could take up to four days to produce one minute of this form of puppet animation. ''Fireman Sam'' has to this day been translated into over 25 different languages including Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firemansamonline.com/uk/Parents/About_Sam/index.asp | title=About Sam | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the original series, all the character voices were performed by [[John Alderton]]. The later series used several actors' voices.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original series (1987\u20131994)===\nThe original series comprised 32 ten-minute episodes and a 20-minute [[Christmas special]]. The narration and all the character voices were done by [[John Alderton]].  Fireman Sam is the main character of the show, and interacts with both colleagues at the [[fire station]] and fellow villagers. He is seen as somewhat of a hero in the village. Despite being so small, and with so little activity, the village sees its fair share of fires, which Sam and his team can easily handle. The vehicles at the fire station include a four-wheeled [[Bedford TK]] fire engine called Jupiter, a six-wheeled 1982 [[TACR2 (Range Rover)|Range Rover Rescue Tender]] named Venus, and Trevor's Bus, a 1985 [[Ford Transit]] Dormobile. Fireman Sam's colleagues are Elvis Cridlington, Station Officer Basil Steele (renamed Norris Steele in the new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series) and later Penny Morris (who hailed from Newtown with the firetender). The villagers are bus driver/auxiliary firefighter Trevor Evans, Italian caf\u00e9 owner Bella Lasagne, Norman Price, Norman's mother Dilys Price, and the twins Sarah and James Jones. The objects include M.O.P., Bentley the Robot, and Mechanical Master Chef.\n\nThe original series aired on [[BBC One]], [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] since it was launched in 1987, most commonly airing on CBeebies on a daily basis with repeats showing until 28 December 2007. In the original series produced by [[Bumper Films]] from 1987 to 1994, the firefighters had yellow and black uniforms, whereas in the 2005 series produced by Siriol Productions and [[Gullane Entertainment]] (Later [[HIT Entertainment]]) and the 2008 [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series produced by [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television), Xing-Xing, [[WildBrain]] and [[DHX Media]], the firefighters now have yellow and blue uniforms.\n\nIn 1988, the original series was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Short Animated Film. The potential recipients were Ian Frampton and John Walker.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329829/awards | title=Awards for \"Fireman Sam\" (1987) | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2005 series===\nIn 2005, a new ''Fireman Sam'' series was produced by [[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] for [[HIT Entertainment]], comprising twenty-six episodes, each ten minutes in length. These episodes used more modern techniques of stop motion [[clay animation|claymation]] including mouths that move with the dialogue. This series featured all the original characters, but also introduced some new faces, such as Tom Thomas, the Australian pilot of the rescue helicopter Wallaby One and the Mountain Rescue 4\u00d74 Jeep, an unnamed photographer/news reporter, and the Flood family; consisting of Mike The Plumber, his wife Helen The Nurse, and their daughter Mandy. The updated Jupiter has six wheels, loosely based on a Bedford 6\u00d74,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Venus is loosely based on a heavily modified 4x4 [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]. The characters in this series were voiced by [[John Sparkes]], Joanna Ruiz and Sarah Hadland. The series also premiered on CBeebies in 2005 and repeats were shown until 2007.\n\n===CGI series (2008\u2013present)===\nThe series was revamped in 2008 which saw the show convert to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Pontypandy is now a seaside fishing village instead of a village set deep in the hills, though most of the locations have retained their appearances. Another change in this series is that the twins' parents appear for the first time; their new-age mother Bronwyn, and fisherman father Charlie, Sam's brother, who runs a caf\u00e9/fish-and-chip shop called the 'Whole Fish Caf\u00e9'. The series was produced by Xing-Xing from 2008-2016 and [[DHX Media]] (Later [[WildBrain]])/IoM Media Ventures Halifax for [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel|Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television) from 2017\u2013present\n\nJupiter was updated again, now with a front end taken from a Volvo FL6. A yellow stripe  was added to the front of the fire engine. Minor changes were made to Venus which included a water nozzle added to the top of its roof. Trevor's bus was updated to a more modern look with angled headlights. New vehicles introduced included Mike Flood's Van in the sixth season onwards, as well as Mercury (fire quad bike), Saturn (infrared drone), The Pontypandy Flyer (Steam Locomotive), and Bessie (Steeles first fire engine) which were introduced from the eighth season onwards.\n\nThe outfits were updated throughout the series (except for Norman Price). This included an update to the firefighter's outfits which added reflective stripes and extra badges to their tunics. Dilys Price received a large makeover which saw her getting makeup, glasses, black hair, a necklace and an updated outfit. The rest of the characters also received minor updates to their clothing.\n\nMany characters also had aspects of their personalities made more apparent. Norman Price is far more mischievous and inconsiderate than in the 2005 series where his pranks were often planned out and his accidents were due to badly planned ideas instead of outrageous schemes. For example, in the episode \"Pontypandy Extreme\", Norman gets trapped down a [[wishing well]] after attempting to climb down in order to retrieve the coins from the bottom. Other examples are Station Officer Steele's strictness and maturity and Elvis's decrease in general competence. For example, in one episode where a first aid training exercise is taking place, Elvis is told off by Steele for dancing with the dummy that is being used. At the same time, Steele is not afraid to unleash the child within him, showing an interest in kite flying and paper planes. He also occasionally causes emergencies himself and often gasps when an emergency comes in. Also, Station Officer Steele's name has changed to Station Officer Norris Steele.\n\nOther changes include the removal of Bella, although her caf\u00e9 can still be seen opposite Dilys' shop, now a [[7-Eleven]]-esque convenience store called the \"Cut Price Supermarket\". It seems the Whole Fish Caf\u00e9 and Bronwyn and Charlie have replaced them. Bella made her first appearance in CGI in the tenth season, where the reason behind her absence was revealed as her moving to Newtown. Penny also now has another string to her bow, as she is a trained ocean rescuer and the helmsman of Neptune (the village's lifeboat). Also, Rosa and Dusty have been replaced by Lion, Nipper, and Radar.\n\nSince 2012, additional characters were introduced: Chief Fire Officer Boyce, one animal called Norris the Guinea Pig, five new villagers named Derek Price  (originally introduced in season 6 as a minor character but then recurring since The Great Fire of Pontypandy), Moose Roberts, Gareth Griffiths, Lily, and Mrs Chen.\n\nIn 2014, other characters were introduced: a coastguard named Ben Hooper, a mechanic & inventor named Joe Sparkes with his vet wife Lizzie Sparkes, and their daughter Hannah Sparkes. Also, new vehicles were introduced: a jet ski named Juno and a fire boat named Titan. Also in the movie \"Heroes of the Storm\", there is Ellie Phillips and Arnold McKinley, new firefighter members. There is Hydrus (previously Catfish or Wildcat) the six-wheeled vehicle boat, and an unnamed Mobile Command Unit, and from 2017 onwards, Bella Lasag\u00f1e makes her CGI debut and the fire station has a new vehicle; Phoenix, the animal rescue 4X4. & Wallaby 1's replacement, is a search & rescue helicopter, Wallaby 2.\n\nThe characters in this series are voiced by [[Steven Kynman]], Andrew Hodwitz, Jonah Ain, Maraget Brock, Tegwen Tucker, Lily Cassano, Dave Pender, Jacob James, Scott Lancastle, Ashley Magwood, David Carling, Mike Pongrazc, Becky Shrimpton, Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer, and Su Douglas.Joe Marth join the cast in 2010, [[John Hasler]], Ifan Huw Dafydd and [[Nigel Whitmey]] joined the cast In 2012 [[Alex Lowe]] [[Christa Clahane]] [[Adam Turgeon]] and [[Jo Wyatt]] joined the cast in 2015. [[Harriet Kershaw]], [[Ian James Corlett]], and Dave McRae, join the cast in 2016\n\nCBeebies last aired ''Fireman Sam'' on 28 December 2007, before [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[Cartoonito]] started airing it from 11 February 2008.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Fireman Sam episodes}}\n{{:List of Fireman Sam episodes}}\n\n==Spin-offs==\nIn 1996, a stage production was turned into a feature, ''[[Fireman Sam In Action]]'', and released on BBC Video.\n\nIn 2009, ''Fireman Sam'' appeared with other animated children's TV characters in a ''[[Children in Need]]'' single. The single was put together by [[Peter Kay]].\n\nThe show saw its first feature-length movie, ''The Great Fire of Pontypandy'', released to DVD and iTunes in 2010, and was shown in select cinemas.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' was adapted into a live musical theatre show, which began touring the UK in June 2011.\n\nIn 2014, [[Amazon Prime]] released ''Fireman Sam'' using American voices instead of British voices for children in the US. However, the characters of Tom Thomas, Moose Roberts and Bella Lasagna have their regular, respective Australian, Canadian and Italian voices (instead of their being dubbed them with a US voice actor) due to their accents. This features the voices of Andrew Hodwitz Jonah Ain Maraget Brock Lily Cassano Dave Pender Jacob James Scott Lancastle Ashley Magwood Mike Pongrazc Becky Shrimpton Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer And David Carling\n\nIn 2015, the show's second feature-length movie ''Heroes of the Storm'' (also known as ''Ultimate Heroes'' in the US) was due to be released in September 2015; however, it was released for American audiences in November 2014.<ref>{{Citation|title=Fireman Sam: Heroes of the Storm (Video 2014)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4460032/releaseinfo|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n===Original series===\n* {{flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom\n** [[BBC One]]\n** [[BBC Two]]\n** [[Sky One]]\n** [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]\n** [[CBeebies]]\n** [[CBBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Wales}} Wales\n** [[S4C]]\n* {{flagicon|United States}} United States\n** [[Amazon Prime]]\n* {{flagicon|Finland}} Finland\n** [[Yle TV1]]\n* {{flagicon|Iceland}} Iceland\n** [[R\u00daV (TV channel)|Sj\u00f3nvarpi\u00f0]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Ireland\n** [[RT\u00c9 One]]\n** [[RT\u00c9 Two]]\n** [[Virgin Media Three]]\n* {{flagicon|Sri Lanka}} Sri Lanka\n** [[ART Television (Sri Lanka)|ART TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** [[ABC Television|ABC]]\n** [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]]\n** [[ABC2]]\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} Poland\n** [[TVP1]]\n* {{flagicon|South Africa}} South Africa\n** [[SABC2]]\n** [[Bop TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|BFBS]]\n** [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation|SSVC Television]]\n* {{flagicon|Singapore}} Singapore\n** [[Channel 5 (Singapore)|Channel 5]]\n* {{flagicon|New Zealand}} New Zealand\n** [[TVNZ 2]]\n** [[TVNZ Kidzone]]\n* {{flagicon|Sweden}} Sweden\n** [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]\n* {{flagicon|Gibraltar}} Gibraltar\n** [[GBC TV]]\n* {{flagicon|UAE}} United Arab Emirates\n** [[Dubai 33]]\n* {{flagicon|Italy}} Italy\n** [[Rai 2]]\n* {{flagicon|Norway}} Norway\n** [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Jordan}} Jordan\n** [[Jordan Radio and Television Corporation|Channel 2]]\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} Canada\n** [[TVOntario]]\n** [[TVO Kids]]\n** [[Knowledge Network]]\n* {{flagicon|Malta}} Malta\n** [[Television Malta|TVM]]\n \n===2005 series===\n* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} United Kingdom\n** [[BBC One]]\n** [[BBC Two]]\n** [[CBeebies]]\n** [[Cartoonito (UK & Ireland)|Cartoonito]]\n* {{flagicon|United States}} United States\n** [[Qubo]]\n** [[Amazon Prime]]\n** [[PBS Kids Sprout]]\n* {{flagicon|Wales}} Wales\n** [[S4C]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Ireland\n** [[RT\u00c9 Two]]\n** [[Virgin Media Three]]\n* {{flagicon|Sri Lanka}} Sri Lanka\n** [[ART Television (Sri Lanka)|ART TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** [[ABC Television|ABC]]\n** [[ABC1]]\n** [[ABC2]]\n** [[ABC 4 Kids]]\n* {{flagicon|Italy}} Italy\n** [[Rai YoYo]]\n* {{flagicon|France}} France\n** [[France 5]]\n* {{flagicon|Malta}} Malta\n** [[JimJam]]\n* {{flagicon|New Zealand}} New Zealand\n** [[TVNZ 6]]\n* {{flagicon|India}} India\n** [[Hungama TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|BFBS]]\n \n===CGI series===\n* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} United Kingdom\n** [[Cartoonito (UK & Ireland)|Cartoonito]]\n** [[CITV]]\n** [[Channel Five]]\n** [[Netflix (UK & Ireland)|Netflix]]\n* {{flagicon|Wales}} Wales\n** [[S4C]]\n* {{flagicon|United States}} United States\n**[[Amazon Prime]]\n**[[Universal Kids]]\n**[[Qubo]]\n**[[Netflix]]\n* {{flagicon|Hungary}} Hungary\n** [[M2 (TV channel)|M2]]\n* {{flagicon|New Zealand}} New Zealand\n** [[TVNZ 2]]\n* {{flagicon|France}} France\n** [[France 4]]\n* {{flagicon|South Africa}} South Africa\n** [[e.tv]]\n* {{flagicon|UAE}} United Arab Emirates\n** [[e-Junior]]\n** [[Spacetoon]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Ireland\n** [[RT\u00c9 Two]]\n** [[RT\u00c9jr]]\n** [[Virgin Media Three]]\n* {{flagicon|Norway}} Norway\n** [[NRK]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** [[ABC2]]\n** [[ABC 4 Kids]]\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} Canada\n** [[Treehouse TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Hong Kong}} Hong Kong\n** [[Asia Television|ATV]]\n* [[File:Location Southeast Asia.svg|20px]] Southeast Asia\n** [[Disney Junior (Southeast Asia)|Disney Junior]]\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] website said of the series, \"All the characters blend together into an appealing mixture of fun and entertainment for children everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/abckids/shows/prog64.htm | title=Fireman Sam at ABC | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Common Sense Media]] recommended the 2003 series for ages three and up, praising it for showing how to \"stay calm in a crisis\" and rely on a team to solve problems.

The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' first appeared as '''''Sam T\u00e2n''''' (''Fireman Sam'' in Welsh) on [[S4C]] in 1987, and at the same time on [[BBC One]]. The original series finished in 1994, and a new series that expanded the character cast commenced in 2005. The series was also shown in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] in Scotland. The series was sold to over 40 countries and has been used across the UK to promote [[fire safety]].\n\n==Development==\nThe original idea came about from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England \u2013 Dave Gingell and [[David Jones (writer)|David Jones]] after [[Commission (art)|purchasing]] the [[stop motion]] animation drawn by artist Anthony Miller and [[Will Vinton]]. They approached [[Mike Young (producer)|Mike Young]], creator of ''[[SuperTed]]'', in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], Wales, and asked them to further develop their concept. The idea was then brought to S4C's Director of Animation, Chris Grace, who had previously commissioned ''SuperTed'', saw potential in the idea and commissioned the series. The characters and storylines were created by Rob Lee, an illustrator from Cardiff, and the programme was made using [[stop motion]]. It could take up to four days to produce one minute of this form of puppet animation. ''Fireman Sam'' has to this day been translated into over 25 different languages including Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firemansamonline.com/uk/Parents/About_Sam/index.asp | title=About Sam | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the original series, all the character voices were performed by [[John Alderton]]. The later series used several actors' voices.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original series (1987\u20131994)===\nThe original series comprised 32 ten-minute episodes and a 20-minute [[Christmas special]]. The narration and all the character voices were done by [[John Alderton]].  Fireman Sam is the main character of the show, and interacts with both colleagues at the [[fire station]] and fellow villagers. He is seen as somewhat of a hero in the village. Despite being so small, and with so little activity, the village sees its fair share of fires, which Sam and his team can easily handle. The vehicles at the fire station include a four-wheeled [[Bedford TK]] fire engine called Jupiter, a six-wheeled 1982 [[TACR2 (Range Rover)|Range Rover Rescue Tender]] named Venus, and Trevor's Bus, a 1985 [[Ford Transit]] Dormobile. Fireman Sam's colleagues are Elvis Cridlington, Station Officer Basil Steele (renamed Norris Steele in the new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series) and later Penny Morris (who hailed from Newtown with the firetender). The villagers are bus driver/auxiliary firefighter Trevor Evans, Italian caf\u00e9 owner Bella Lasagne, Norman Price, Norman's mother Dilys Price, and the twins Sarah and James Jones. The objects include M.O.P., Bentley the Robot, and Mechanical Master Chef.\n\nThe original series aired on [[BBC One]], [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] since it was launched in 1987, most commonly airing on CBeebies on a daily basis with repeats showing until 28 December 2007. In the original series produced by [[Bumper Films]] from 1987 to 1994, the firefighters had yellow and black uniforms, whereas in the 2005 series produced by Siriol Productions and [[Gullane Entertainment]] (Later [[HIT Entertainment]]) and the 2008 [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series produced by [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television), Xing-Xing, [[WildBrain]] and [[DHX Media]], the firefighters now have yellow and blue uniforms.\n\nIn 1988, the original series was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Short Animated Film. The potential recipients were Ian Frampton and John Walker.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329829/awards | title=Awards for \"Fireman Sam\" (1987) | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2005 series===\nIn 2005, a new ''Fireman Sam'' series was produced by [[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] for [[HIT Entertainment]], comprising twenty-six episodes, each ten minutes in length. These episodes used more modern techniques of stop motion [[clay animation|claymation]] including mouths that move with the dialogue. This series featured all the original characters, but also introduced some new faces, such as Tom Thomas, the Australian pilot of the rescue helicopter Wallaby One and the Mountain Rescue 4\u00d74 Jeep, an unnamed photographer/news reporter, and the Flood family; consisting of Mike The Plumber, his wife Helen The Nurse, and their daughter Mandy. The updated Jupiter has six wheels, loosely based on a Bedford 6\u00d74,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Venus is loosely based on a heavily modified 4x4 [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]. The characters in this series were voiced by [[John Sparkes]], Joanna Ruiz and Sarah Hadland. The series also premiered on CBeebies in 2005 and repeats were shown until 2007.\n\n===CGI series (2008\u2013present)===\nThe series was revamped in 2008 which saw the show convert to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Pontypandy is now a seaside fishing village instead of a village set deep in the hills, though most of the locations have retained their appearances. Another change in this series is that the twins' parents appear for the first time; their new-age mother Bronwyn, and fisherman father Charlie, Sam's brother, who runs a caf\u00e9/fish-and-chip shop called the 'Whole Fish Caf\u00e9'. The series was produced by Xing-Xing from 2008-2016 and [[DHX Media]] (Later [[WildBrain]])/IoM Media Ventures Halifax for [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel|Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television) from 2017\u2013present\n\nJupiter was updated again, now with a front end taken from a Volvo FL6. A yellow stripe  was added to the front of the fire engine. Minor changes were made to Venus which included a water nozzle added to the top of its roof. Trevor's bus was updated to a more modern look with angled headlights. New vehicles introduced included Mike Flood's Van in the sixth season onwards, as well as Mercury (fire quad bike), Saturn (infrared drone), The Pontypandy Flyer (Steam Locomotive), and Bessie (Steeles first fire engine) which were introduced from the eighth season onwards.\n\nThe outfits were updated throughout the series (except for Norman Price). This included an update to the firefighter's outfits which added reflective stripes and extra badges to their tunics. Dilys Price received a large makeover which saw her getting makeup, glasses, black hair, a necklace and an updated outfit. The rest of the characters also received minor updates to their clothing.\n\nMany characters also had aspects of their personalities made more apparent. Norman Price is far more mischievous and inconsiderate than in the 2005 series where his pranks were often planned out and his accidents were due to badly planned ideas instead of outrageous schemes. For example, in the episode \"Pontypandy Extreme\", Norman gets trapped down a [[wishing well]] after attempting to climb down in order to retrieve the coins from the bottom. Other examples are Station Officer Steele's strictness and maturity and Elvis's decrease in general competence. For example, in one episode where a first aid training exercise is taking place, Elvis is told off by Steele for dancing with the dummy that is being used. At the same time, Steele is not afraid to unleash the child within him, showing an interest in kite flying and paper planes. He also occasionally causes emergencies himself and often gasps when an emergency comes in. Also, Station Officer Steele's name has changed to Station Officer Norris Steele.\n\nOther changes include the removal of Bella, although her caf\u00e9 can still be seen opposite Dilys' shop, now a [[7-Eleven]]-esque convenience store called the \"Cut Price Supermarket\". It seems the Whole Fish Caf\u00e9 and Bronwyn and Charlie have replaced them. Bella made her first appearance in CGI in the tenth season, where the reason behind her absence was revealed as her moving to Newtown. Penny also now has another string to her bow, as she is a trained ocean rescuer and the helmsman of Neptune (the village's lifeboat). Also, Rosa and Dusty have been replaced by Lion, Nipper, and Radar.\n\nSince 2012, additional characters were introduced: Chief Fire Officer Boyce, one animal called Norris the Guinea Pig, five new villagers named Derek Price  (originally introduced in season 6 as a minor character but then recurring since The Great Fire of Pontypandy), Moose Roberts, Gareth Griffiths, Lily, and Mrs Chen.\n\nIn 2014, other characters were introduced: a coastguard named Ben Hooper, a mechanic & inventor named Joe Sparkes with his vet wife Lizzie Sparkes, and their daughter Hannah Sparkes. Also, new vehicles were introduced: a jet ski named Juno and a fire boat named Titan. Also in the movie \"Heroes of the Storm\", there is Ellie Phillips and Arnold McKinley, new firefighter members. There is Hydrus (previously Catfish or Wildcat) the six-wheeled vehicle boat, and an unnamed Mobile Command Unit, and from 2017 onwards, Bella Lasag\u00f1e makes her CGI debut and the fire station has a new vehicle; Phoenix, the animal rescue 4X4. & Wallaby 1's replacement, is a search & rescue helicopter, Wallaby 2.\n\nThe characters in this series are voiced by [[Steven Kynman]], Andrew Hodwitz, Jonah Ain, Maraget Brock, Tegwen Tucker, Lily Cassano, Dave Pender, Jacob James, Scott Lancastle, Ashley Magwood, David Carling, Mike Pongrazc, Becky Shrimpton, Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer, and Su Douglas.Joe Marth join the cast in 2010, [[John Hasler]], Ifan Huw Dafydd and [[Nigel Whitmey]] joined the cast In 2012 [[Alex Lowe]] [[Christa Clahane]] [[Adam Turgeon]] and [[Jo Wyatt]] joined the cast in 2015. [[Harriet Kershaw]], [[Ian James Corlett]], and Dave McRae, join the cast in 2016\n\nCBeebies last aired ''Fireman Sam'' on 28 December 2007, before [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[Cartoonito]] started airing it from 11 February 2008.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Fireman Sam episodes}}\n{{:List of Fireman Sam episodes}}\n\n==Spin-offs==\nIn 1996, a stage production was turned into a feature, ''[[Fireman Sam In Action]]'', and released on BBC Video.\n\nIn 2009, ''Fireman Sam'' appeared with other animated children's TV characters in a ''[[Children in Need]]'' single. The single was put together by [[Peter Kay]].\n\nThe show saw its first feature-length movie, ''The Great Fire of Pontypandy'', released to DVD and iTunes in 2010, and was shown in select cinemas.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' was adapted into a live musical theatre show, which began touring the UK in June 2011.\n\nIn 2014, [[Amazon Prime]] released ''Fireman Sam'' using American voices instead of British voices for children in the US. However, the characters of Tom Thomas, Moose Roberts and Bella Lasagna have their regular, respective Australian, Canadian and Italian voices (instead of their being dubbed them with a US voice actor) due to their accents. This features the voices of Andrew Hodwitz Jonah Ain Maraget Brock Lily Cassano Dave Pender Jacob James Scott Lancastle Ashley Magwood Mike Pongrazc Becky Shrimpton Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer And David Carling\n\nIn 2015, the show's second feature-length movie ''Heroes of the Storm'' (also known as ''Ultimate Heroes'' in the US) was due to be released in September 2015; however, it was released for American audiences in November 2014.<ref>{{Citation|title=Fireman Sam: Heroes of the Storm (Video 2014)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4460032/releaseinfo|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] website said of the series, \"All the characters blend together into an appealing mixture of fun and entertainment for children everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/abckids/shows/prog64.htm | title=Fireman Sam at ABC | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Common Sense Media]] recommended the 2003 series for ages three and up, praising it for showing how to \"stay calm in a crisis\" and rely on a team to solve problems. The American website found that the \"distinctly Welsh characters, community, accents, and expressions may pose some minor comprehension problems for kids on this side of the pond\", but considered it a useful example of life in another part of the world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/Fireman-Sam.html | title=Fireman Sam at commonsensemedia | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Fireman Sam Quran.jpg|thumb|A page from the [[Quran]] appearing in ''Fireman Sam'', in a banned episode controversy]]\nIn July 2016, it emerged that in Series 9, Episode 7 - in which the character Elvis slips on a piece of paper and falls into a stack of paper, causing them to fly everywhere - one of the flying pages that briefly came into view was identified as a page from the [[Quran]]: \"Surah Mulk (67), verses 13\u201326\".<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Patrick|title=Fireman Sam episode pulled amid Quran row|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36900310|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 July 2016|date=27 July 2016}}</ref> The production company Mattel apologised for this accident, removed the episode from broadcast, and ceased work with Xing Xing, the animation company responsible for the error.

The DVD cover claimed that the show was made by \"the makers of  ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''.\" However, this is only true for ''Charlie Chalk'' (since the slogan was used on all the Woodland Animations DVDs in Australia), because [[Jocelyn Stevenson]] (writer of ''Charlie Chalk'') became the executive producer on ''Thomas and Friends'' from the seventh season onwards.\n\n===Photobooks===\n\nIn 1985, to accompany the programme, some photobooks were released with altered titles to fit the style of the books. These were very similar to the ''Postman Pat'' photobooks, where the front cover would be an original illustration and all pictures within the book were images from the TV programme.\n* ''Bertha and the Great Painting Job (The Great Painting Job)''\n* ''Bertha and the Windmills (The Windmills)''\n* ''Bertha and the Mouse in the Works (A Mouse in the works)''\n* ''Bertha and the Best Machine Competition (The Best Machine Competition)''\n* ''Bertha and the Lost TOM (T.O.M.

However, it is possible that the song \"Mr. Duncan\" was to feature in the episode \"More Speed, Less Work\" but was not included due to it making the episode too long. The same is the case with \"Mr. Willmake\" possibly featuring in the episode \"Bertha's Birthday\".\n\nThe album also had a cassette release with the reference number of ZCR 585. \n\n===Board game===\n\nIn 1987, Falcon released a board game using illustrations similar to those seen on the front covers of the photobooks. The game itself does not differ much from the Monopoly series of board games. If a player lands on T.O.M., they are allowed to ask Bertha to make an item for them.\n\n===Advent calendar===\n\nIn 1985, an Advent calendar using the same profile image as the vinyl record was released.\n\n===Annuals===\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988, ''Bertha'' featured in a total of four annuals:\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1985\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1986\n* ''Buttons'' (based on Children's BBC) annual 1987 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''King Rollo'', ''Towser'', ''Henry's Cat'' and ''Jimbo and the Jet Set'')\n* ''Buttons'' annual 1988 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''Charlie Chalk'', ''Henry's Cat'', ''Towser'', ''King Rollo'' and ''Spot'')\n\n==International Broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|UK}} UK\n** [[BBC1]]\n** [[BBC2]]\n** [[The Children's Channel|TCC]]\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} Poland\n** [[TVP1]]\n* {{flagicon|South Africa}} South Africa\n** [[SABC1]]\n** [[Bop TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Sweden}} Sweden\n** [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** Max\n** [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]]\n** [[ABC2]]\n* {{flagicon|Hungary}} Hungary\n** [[M1 (Hungary)|M1]]\n* {{flagicon|France}} France\n** [[La Cinq]], but now on [[France 5]]\n** [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} Canada\n** [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]\n** [[Teletoon]]\n* {{flagicon|Singapore}} Singapore\n** [[MediaCorp Channel 5]]\n* {{flagicon|Norway}} Norway\n** [[NRK]]\n* {{flagicon|Denmark}} Denmark\n** [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]\n* {{flagicon|Nigeria}} Nigeria\n** [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]]\n* {{flagicon|Gibraltar}} Gibraltar\n** [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation|GBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|BFBS]]\n** [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation|SSVC Television]]\n\n==Credits==\n* '''Written by:''' Eric Charles\n* '''Narration by:''' Roy Kinnear\n* '''Voices by:''' Roy Kinnear and Sheila Walker\n* '''Music and lyrics by:''' Bryan Daly\n* '''Director of animation:''' Derek Mogford\n* '''Series designed and directed by:''' Ivor Wood\n* '''Film editor:''' Martin Bohan\n* '''Song vocals:''' Guy Fletcher\n* '''Recorded at:''' Havoc House Studios\n* '''Sound by:''' Clive Pendry\n* '''Produced by:''' Woodland Animations Ltd\n* '''\u00a9 Woodland Animations Ltd MCMLXXXV'''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0211240|title=Bertha}}\n* [http://www.thechestnut.com/bertha/bertha.htm Little Gems]\n* [http://www.toonhound.com/bertha.htm Toonhound]\n\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:British stop-motion animated television series]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Classics]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:1980s British animated television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Refimprove |date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox television |\n| show_name = Bertha\n| image =<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Bertha1985.jpg]] -->\n| caption =\n| camera =\n| picture_format =\n| audio_format =\n| runtime = 15 minutes\n| creator= [[Eric Charles]]<br>[[Stephen Flewers]]\n| producer = [[Ivor Wood]]\n| executive_producer =\n| starring = [[Roy Kinnear]] (voice)<br>[[Sheila Walker]] (voice)\n| narrated = [[Roy Kinnear]]\n| theme_music_composer = [[Bryan Daly]]\n| opentheme =\n| endtheme =\n| country = [[United Kingdom]]\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| network = [[BBC 1]]/[[BBC 2]]\n| first_aired = 1 April 1985\n| last_aired = 18 June 1986\n| num_episodes = 13\n| list_episodes =\n| website =\n|}}\n\n'''''Bertha''''' is a British [[stop motion]]-animated children's television series about a factory machine of that name, comprising 13 episodes that aired from 1985 to 1986. Other major characters in the series were Mr Willmake (factory manager), Mr Sprott (Bertha's chief designer), Tracy (Mr Sprott's young assistant), and Roy. All the characters were designed by Ivor Wood, and the series was produced by his company, [[Woodland Animations]]. It was broadcast on [[BBC Television]].<ref name=\"Bertha\">{{cite web|title=TV TOONS: Bertha (1985)|url=http://www.toonhound.com/bertha.htm|work=Toonhound: cartoons, animation, comic strips and puppets in the UK|publisher=Woodland Animations|accessdate=15 April 2012|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nA series of six storybooks based on ''Bertha'' was published by [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] at the same time as the series was broadcast. They were adapted by Eric Charles and illustrated by Steve Augarde, who was also responsible for the artwork and music in the children's series ''[[Bump (TV series)|Bump]]''.<ref name=\"Bertha\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is set in an [[industrial estate]] occupied by the Spottiswood & Company factory, a small [[manufacturing plant]] producing a wide range of goods ranging from [[cuckoo clock]]s to windmill money boxes. Each episode focuses on a machine called Bertha that can produce any item requested of her. In each episode, the factory experiences a crisis affecting its daily production schedule, which Bertha invariably solves with the help of her factory worker friends.\n\n==Production==\n''Bertha'' was created by Woodland Animations, who also produced the shows ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Charlie Chalk]]'' and ''[[Gran (TV series)|Gran]]'' for the BBC. Episodes were written by Eric Charles and Stephen Flewers, and designed, produced and directed by [[Ivor Wood]], co-founder of the Woodland company. [[Roy Kinnear]] and [[Sheila Walker]] voiced the characters, and Kinnear narrated. The [[Main title|main title music]] featured the singing of [[Guy Fletcher (songwriter)|Guy Fletcher]].

The DVD cover claimed that the show was made by \"the makers of  ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''.\" However, this is only true for ''Charlie Chalk'' (since the slogan was used on all the Woodland Animations DVDs in Australia), because [[Jocelyn Stevenson]] (writer of ''Charlie Chalk'') became the executive producer on ''Thomas and Friends'' from the seventh season onwards.\n\n===Photobooks===\n\nIn 1985, to accompany the programme, some photobooks were released with altered titles to fit the style of the books. These were very similar to the ''Postman Pat'' photobooks, where the front cover would be an original illustration and all pictures within the book were images from the TV programme.\n* ''Bertha and the Great Painting Job (The Great Painting Job)''\n* ''Bertha and the Windmills (The Windmills)''\n* ''Bertha and the Mouse in the Works (A Mouse in the works)''\n* ''Bertha and the Best Machine Competition (The Best Machine Competition)''\n* ''Bertha and the Lost TOM (T.O.M. Gets Lost)''\n* ''Bertha and the Flying Bear (The Flying Bear)''\n\n===Vinyl record===\nIn 1986, after broadcast ended, the BBC's record label released a 12\" vinyl record containing songs from the TV series.\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Side 1\n| extra_column    = Vocals\n\n| all_writing     = Bryan Daly\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = Bertha\n| extra1          = Guy Fletcher\n| length1         =\n\n| title2          = Mrs. Tupp\n| extra2          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length2         =\n\n| title3          = Packing and Stacking\n| extra3          = Guy Fletcher, Eva Burden\n| length3         =\n\n| title4          = The Flying Bear\n| note4           = *) (instrumental\n| extra4          =\n| length4         =\n\n| title5          = Mr. Duncan\n| note5           = *\n| extra5          = Bryan Daly\n| length5         =\n\n| title6          = Turning Wheels\n| note6           = *) (instrumental\n| extra6          =\n| length6         =\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Side 2\n| extra_column    =\n\n| all_writing     =\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = T.O.M. the Robot\n| extra1          = Guy Fletcher\n| length1         =\n\n| title2          = Isn't it Nice?\n| note2           = *\n| extra2          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length2         =\n\n| title3          = Mr. Willmake\n| note3           = *\n| extra3          = Guy Fletcher, Stefanie De Sykes\n| length3         =\n\n| title4          = Tracy's Robot Song\n| extra4          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length4         =\n\n| title5          = Spottiswood March\n| note5           = (*) (instrumental)\n| extra5          =\n| length5         =\n\n| title6          = Roy the Apprentice\n| extra6          = Guy Fletcher\n| length6         =\n}}\n\nTracks marked with an asterisk (*) did not feature in the TV series. However, it is possible that the song \"Mr. Duncan\" was to feature in the episode \"More Speed, Less Work\" but was not included due to it making the episode too long. The same is the case with \"Mr. Willmake\" possibly featuring in the episode \"Bertha's Birthday\".\n\nThe album also had a cassette release with the reference number of ZCR 585. \n\n===Board game===\n\nIn 1987, Falcon released a board game using illustrations similar to those seen on the front covers of the photobooks. The game itself does not differ much from the Monopoly series of board games. If a player lands on T.O.M., they are allowed to ask Bertha to make an item for them.\n\n===Advent calendar===\n\nIn 1985, an Advent calendar using the same profile image as the vinyl record was released.\n\n===Annuals===\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988, ''Bertha'' featured in a total of four annuals:\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1985\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1986\n* ''Buttons'' (based on Children's BBC) annual 1987 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''King Rollo'', ''Towser'', ''Henry's Cat'' and ''Jimbo and the Jet Set'')\n* ''Buttons'' annual 1988 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''Charlie Chalk'', ''Henry's Cat'', ''Towser'', ''King Rollo'' and ''Spot'')\n==Credits==\n* '''Written by:''' Eric Charles\n* '''Narration by:''' Roy Kinnear\n* '''Voices by:''' Roy Kinnear and Sheila Walker\n* '''Music and lyrics by:''' Bryan Daly\n* '''Director of animation:''' Derek Mogford\n* '''Series designed and directed by:''' Ivor Wood\n* '''Film editor:''' Martin Bohan\n* '''Song vocals:''' Guy Fletcher\n* '''Recorded at:''' Havoc House Studios\n* '''Sound by:''' Clive Pendry\n* '''Produced by:''' Woodland Animations Ltd\n* '''\u00a9 Woodland Animations Ltd MCMLXXXV'''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0211240|title=Bertha}}\n* [http://www.thechestnut.com/bertha/bertha.htm Little Gems]\n* [http://www.toonhound.com/bertha.htm Toonhound]\n\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:British stop-motion animated television series]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Classics]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:1980s British animated television series]]\n", "name_user": "81.131.111.68", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMerchandise)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(TV_series)"}

Its sister station, [[ATV Home]], broadcast in [[Hong Kong Cantonese|Cantonese language]]. It is owned and operated by [[Asia Television]] ({{zh|t=\u4e9e\u6d32\u96fb\u8996\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8}}), and was broadcast from the '''ATV Enterprises Office''' at 25\u201337 Dai Shing Street in [[Tai Po Industrial Estate]] in [[Tai Po]], which is in the [[Tai Po District]], in the North East region of Hong Kong's [[New Territories]].\n\n==From Rediffusion to ATV==\nATV World's English channel, [[Rediffusion Television]], began as a [[cable television|cable]]-operated and [[subscription television|subscription]]-based [[pay television|pay television service]] on 29 May 1957 known on-air as '''Rediffusion Television English Network''', and on 30 September 1963, the channel was renamed '''Rediffusion Television Cantonese Channel''' and '''Rediffusion Television English Channel'''. On 1 February 1967, the channels were renamed '''RTV-1''' and '''RTV-2''' respectively. On 1 December 1973, Rediffusion Television was granted a [[free-to-air]] [[terrestrial television|terrestrial television broadcasting]] license for its two television channels, and closed its [[cable television-] channels. On 24 September 1982, Rediffusion Television was bought out by the new [[Asia Television|ATV]], and consequently the [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and English language channels were renamed '''ATV Cantonese''' and '''ATV English''' respectively. The channels were again renamed on 2 February 1987 as '''ATV Gold''' and '''ATV Diamond''', and further renamed on 13 February 1989 as '''[[ATV Home]]''' and '''ATV World'''.\n\nATV World was a 24-hour channel with multi-lingual programmes, transmitted in [[NICAM]] in analogue version, and multiple AC-3 streams in digital version. While most of programmes were broadcast in [[Hong Kong English]], a few were in either [[Standard Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or Japanese without [[Hong Kong English]]. It was less popular than its English-language rival station rival [[TVB Pearl]], though by a far smaller margin than ATV Home's loss to [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] rival [[TVB Jade]].\n\nOn 6 June 2012, ATV gained access to the [[London 2012 Olympic Games]] broadcast rights, and consequently the Games were shown on ATV World.\n\n==Shows on ATV World==\nATV World was one of two English-language channels that broadcast in Hong Kong. It offered a variety of programmes, mostly from the United States, ranging from popular serial dramas and films to documentaries and educational shows. Among the shows it aired were:\n\n* ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u751c\u5fc3\u4fcf\u4f73\u4eba}})\n* ''[[BoBoiBoy]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5c07\u535a\u4f0a\u7537\u5b69}})\n* ''[[BoBoiBoy: The Movie|BoBoiBoy The Movie]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5c07\u535a\u4f0a\u7537\u5b69: \u9019\u90e8\u96fb\u5f71}})\n* ''[[The Closer]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u771f\u76f8\u8ffd\u64ca}})\n* ''[[The District]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u83ef\u5e9c\u57f7\u6cd5\u4ee4}})\n* ''[[The Practice]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6cd5\u7db2\u8c6a\u60c5}})\n* ''[[The Guardian (TV series)|The Guardian]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6cd5\u5916\u60c5\u771f}})\n* ''[[The Agency (2001 TV series)|The Agency]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u7279\u52d9\u4e2d\u60c5\u5c40}})\n* ''[[Boomtown (2002 TV series)|Boomtown]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5343\u9762\u8b0e\u57ce}})\n* ''[[Traveler (TV series)|Traveler]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u7d55\u5bc6\u8b0e\u9014}})\n* ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9435\u8b49\u61f8\u6848}})\n* ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9451\u8b49\u884c\u52d5\u7d44}})\n* ''[[CSI: NY]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9451\u8b49\u7d10\u7d04}})\n* ''[[Jack & Bobby]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9326\u7e61\u5e74\u83ef}})\n* ''[[Justice (2006 TV series)|Justice]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6cd5\u7db2\u98a8\u96f2}})\n* ''[[3 lbs]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u8166\u4eba\u9593}})\n* ''[[Eleventh Hour (US TV series)|Eleventh Hour]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u63db\u547d\u4e00\u523b}})\n* ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6700\u9ad8\u7d71\u5e25}})\n* ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5b64\u57ce}})\n* ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6cd5\u7db2\u88c2\u75d5}})\n* ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5fc3\u7406\u8ffd\u5147}})\n* ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u91ab\u8005\u4f34\u6211\u5fc3}})\n* ''[[E-Ring]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u4e94\u89d2\u4efb\u52d9}})\n* ''[[Doctor Who]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u7570\u4e16\u5947\u4eba}})\n* ''[[Torchwood]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u8d85\u7591\u7279\u5de5}})\n* ''[[Elizabeth I (2005 miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u4f0a\u5229\u6c99\u4f2f\u4e00\u4e16\u50b3\u5947}})\n* ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9748\u611f\u61c9}})\n* ''[[Love Monkey]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6a02\u58c7\u6709\u5fc3\u4eba}})\n* ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u91ab\u4eba\u7576\u81ea\u5f37}})\n* ''[[Smallville]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u8d85\u4eba\u524d\u50b3}})\n* ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u751f\u9084\u8005}})\n* ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6ec5\u7f6a\u9451\u8b49\u79d1}})\n* ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u590f\u5a01\u5937\u63a2\u6848}})\n* ''[[Eli Stone]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5927\u72c0\u5947\u7de3}})\n* ''[[Psych]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9b3c\u9748\u5075\u63a2}})\n* ''[[30 Rock]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5a1b\u6a02\u63f8Fit\u4eba}})\n* ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6d77\u7dbf\u5bf6\u5bf6}})\n* ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u71df\u62c9\u8332\u6d1b}})\n* ''[[Psych (season 2)|Psych 2]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9b3c\u9748\u5075\u63a22}})\n* ''[[Greatest American Dog]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u683c\u9b25\u72d7\u72d7}})\n* ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u99ac\u7279\u6d1b\u514b}})\n===Now Playing===\n* ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6d77\u72fc\u7279\u8b66}})\n* ''[[Seconds From Disaster]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u4e16\u7d00\u7684\u707d\u96e3}})\n* ''[[CSI: NY]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9451\u8b49\u7d10\u7d04}})\n* ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|V\u2013\u5916\u661f\u4eba}})\n* ''[[Merlin]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9b54\u6cd5\u7a46\u6797}})\n* ''[[60 Minutes]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|60\u5206\u9418\u6642\u4e8b\u96dc\u8a8c}})\n* ''[[Hunter Hunted (TV series)|Hunter Hunted]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u7375\u6bba}})\n* ''[[The Dresden Files (TV series)|The Dresden Files]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u9b3c\u773c\u795e\u63a2}})\n* ''[[The Late News (ATV)|The Late News]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u591c\u9593\u65b0\u805e}})\n\nATV stopped carrying the talk show ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5927\u885b\u7259\u64e6\u9a37}}) as of 1 January 2009, but there was a grassroots movement to bring it back. Arts and sports programming were also offered (e.g. [[Hong Kong Jockey Club|local horse racing]], in Chinese {{lang|zh-hk|\u8cfd\u99ac\u76f4\u64ca}}). [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and Korean programmes were available on ATV World at off-peak hours.\n\n==[[Warner Bros. Animation]] on ATV World==\nATV World was one of two English-language channels that broadcast in Hong Kong. The network airs various shows that aired on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Kids' WB]], [[Boomerang (UK & Ireland)|Boomerang]] and many more.\n\n* ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (\u8d85\u4eba\uff1a\u52a8\u753b\u7cfb\u5217)\n* ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (\u6b63\u7fa9\u806f\u76df)\n* ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'' (\u5f48\u52be\u4e0d\u904e\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u96e3\u4ee5\u77f3\u6392\u7063)\n* ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' (\u6a02\u4e00\u901a)\n* ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' (\u5bf6\u8c9d\u6a02\u4e00\u901a)\n* ''[[Freakazoid!]]''\n* ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'' (\u6a02\u4e00\u901a\u8d85\u80fd\u7279\u653b\u968a)\n* ''[[The Merrie Melodies Show]]''\n* ''[[The Porky Pig Show]]''\n* ''[[The Road Runner Show]]''\n* ''[[Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' (\u50bb\u5927\u8c93&\u5d14\u5f1f\u7684\u61f8\u7591\u5287\u5834)\n* ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' (\u732b\u548c\u8001\u9f20\u4f20\u5947)\n* ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (\u8e81\u72c2\u5854\u65af)\n* ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' (\u5c11\u5e74\u608d\u5c07 GO\uff01)\n* ''[[What's New Scooby-Doo]]'' (\u521b\u5efa)\n* ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' (\u6c7a\u6230\u5c11\u6797)\n\n==Programmes==\n\nATV World's flagship English news programme was the \"Main News and Weather Report at 7:30\" provided under the collective effort of [[ATV News]]. It also relayed the [[Xinwen Lianbo]] news programme from Chinese television channel, [[CCTV-1]], which is the primary channel of the Chinese television network, [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), in the People's Republic of China which is also available throughout Hong Kong.\n\nGiven its focus on [[Hong Kong English]]-language programming in a predominantly [[Hong Kong Cantonese]]-speaking market, ATV World carried relatively little advertising and was subsidised by [[ATV Home]]. Both of the-then free-to-air television companies in Hong Kong were required by the government to provide a [[Hong Kong English]]-language service. In the face of competition from [[TVB Pearl]], ATV World had in recent years switched its focus from the provision of drama and movies to documentaries and natural history shows, probably because such programming is less expensive to acquire.\n\nSince [[Government of Hong Kong|the Hong Kong government]] does not have its own television station, its agency [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] (RTHK) required the-then two domestic free television stations to broadcast their programmes and advertisements. One of the well known programmes is [[Educational Television (Hong Kong)|Educational Television]] (ETV) which began in 1971. This followed the Hong Kong education syllabus, serving as a reference for primary and secondary school students of mathematics, [[Hong Kong English]], [[Putonghua]] and other school subjects.

Its sister station, [[ATV Home]], broadcast in [[Hong Kong Cantonese|Cantonese language]]. It is owned and operated by [[Asia Television]] ({{zh|t=\u4e9e\u6d32\u96fb\u8996\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8}}), and was broadcast from the '''ATV Enterprises Office''' at 25\u201337 Dai Shing Street in [[Tai Po Industrial Estate]] in [[Tai Po]], which is in the [[Tai Po District]], in the North East region of Hong Kong's [[New Territories]].\n\n==From Rediffusion to ATV==\nATV World's English channel, [[Rediffusion Television]], began as a [[cable television|cable]]-operated and [[subscription television|subscription]]-based [[pay television|pay television service]] on 29 May 1957 known on-air as '''Rediffusion Television English Network''', and on 30 September 1963, the channel was renamed '''Rediffusion Television Cantonese Channel''' and '''Rediffusion Television English Channel'''. On 1 February 1967, the channels were renamed '''RTV-1''' and '''RTV-2''' respectively. On 1 December 1973, Rediffusion Television was granted a [[free-to-air]] [[terrestrial television|terrestrial television broadcasting]] license for its two television channels, and closed its [[cable television-] channels. On 24 September 1982, Rediffusion Television was bought out by the new [[Asia Television|ATV]], and consequently the [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and English language channels were renamed '''ATV Cantonese''' and '''ATV English''' respectively. The channels were again renamed on 2 February 1987 as '''ATV Gold''' and '''ATV Diamond''', and further renamed on 13 February 1989 as '''[[ATV Home]]''' and '''ATV World'''.\n\nATV World was a 24-hour channel with multi-lingual programmes, transmitted in [[NICAM]] in analogue version, and multiple AC-3 streams in digital version. While most of programmes were broadcast in [[Hong Kong English]], a few were in either [[Standard Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or Japanese without [[Hong Kong English]]. It was less popular than its English-language rival station rival [[TVB Pearl]], though by a far smaller margin than ATV Home's loss to [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] rival [[TVB Jade]].\n\nOn 6 June 2012, ATV gained access to the [[London 2012 Olympic Games]] broadcast rights, and consequently the Games were shown on ATV World.\n\n==Shows on ATV World==\nATV World was one of two English-language channels that broadcast in Hong Kong.

Arts and sports programming were also offered (e.g. [[Hong Kong Jockey Club|local horse racing]], in Chinese {{lang|zh-hk|\u8cfd\u99ac\u76f4\u64ca}}). [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and Korean programmes were available on ATV World at off-peak hours.\n\n==[[Warner Bros. Animation]] on ATV World==\nATV World was one of two English-language channels that broadcast in Hong Kong. The network airs various shows that aired on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Kids' WB]], [[Boomerang (UK & Ireland)|Boomerang]] and many more.\n\n* ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (\u8d85\u4eba\uff1a\u52a8\u753b\u7cfb\u5217)\n* ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (\u6b63\u7fa9\u806f\u76df)\n* ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'' (\u5f48\u52be\u4e0d\u904e\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u96e3\u4ee5\u77f3\u6392\u7063)\n* ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' (\u6a02\u4e00\u901a)\n* ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' (\u5bf6\u8c9d\u6a02\u4e00\u901a)\n* ''[[Freakazoid!]]''\n* ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'' (\u6a02\u4e00\u901a\u8d85\u80fd\u7279\u653b\u968a)\n* ''[[The Merrie Melodies Show]]''\n* ''[[The Porky Pig Show]]''\n* ''[[The Road Runner Show]]''\n* ''[[Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' (\u50bb\u5927\u8c93&\u5d14\u5f1f\u7684\u61f8\u7591\u5287\u5834)\n* ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' (\u732b\u548c\u8001\u9f20\u4f20\u5947)\n* ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (\u8e81\u72c2\u5854\u65af)\n* ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' (\u5c11\u5e74\u608d\u5c07 GO\uff01)\n* ''[[What's New Scooby-Doo]]'' (\u521b\u5efa)\n* ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' (\u6c7a\u6230\u5c11\u6797)\n\n==Programmes==\n\nATV World's flagship English news programme was the \"Main News and Weather Report at 7:30\" provided under the collective effort of [[ATV News]]. It also relayed the [[Xinwen Lianbo]] news programme from Chinese television channel, [[CCTV-1]], which is the primary channel of the Chinese television network, [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), in the People's Republic of China which is also available throughout Hong Kong.\n\nGiven its focus on [[Hong Kong English]]-language programming in a predominantly [[Hong Kong Cantonese]]-speaking market, ATV World carried relatively little advertising and was subsidised by [[ATV Home]]. Both of the-then free-to-air television companies in Hong Kong were required by the government to provide a [[Hong Kong English]]-language service. In the face of competition from [[TVB Pearl]], ATV World had in recent years switched its focus from the provision of drama and movies to documentaries and natural history shows, probably because such programming is less expensive to acquire.\n\nSince [[Government of Hong Kong|the Hong Kong government]] does not have its own television station, its agency [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] (RTHK) required the-then two domestic free television stations to broadcast their programmes and advertisements. One of the well known programmes is [[Educational Television (Hong Kong)|Educational Television]] (ETV) which began in 1971. This followed the Hong Kong education syllabus, serving as a reference for primary and secondary school students of mathematics, [[Hong Kong English]], [[Putonghua]] and other school subjects. During the thirty-two-week school year, ETV programmes were shown on ATV World from 10:00 to 12:00 and [[TVB Pearl]] from 14:00 to 16:00 each weekday.\n \n===Imported Programmes===\n'''Comedy'''\n*''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]''\n*''[[American Dreamer (TV series)|American Dreamer]]''\n*''[[Bagdad Cafe (TV series)|Bagdad Cafe]]''\n*''[[Dad's Army]]''\n*''[[Full House (1987 TV series)|Full House]]''\n*''[[Get Smart]]''\n*''The Happy Apple''\n*''[[I Love Lucy]]''\n*''[[The Latest Buzz]]''\n*''[[Maniac Mansion (TV series)|Maniac Mansion]]''\n*''[[Mister Ed]]''\n*''[[Mr Bean]]''\n*''[[The Munsters Today]]''\n*''[[My Favorite Martian]]''\n*''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''\n*''[[On the Buses]]''\n*''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]''\n*''[[Punky Brewster]]''\n*''[[Saved by the Bell]]''\n*''[[Silver Spoons]]''\n*''[[Sledge Hammer!]]''\n*''Starting from Scratch''\n*''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''\n*''[[Two and a Half Men]]''\n\n'''Lifestyle'''\n*''[[Fame, Fortune and Romance]]''\n\n'''Drama'''\n*''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]''\n*''[[Ally McBeal]]''\n*''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''\n*''[[The Beachcombers]]''\n*''[[Beautiful People (American TV series)|Beautiful People]]''\n*''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''\n*''[[Bring 'Em Back Alive]]''\n*''[[The Byrds of Paradise]]''\n*''[[Cagney & Lacey]]''\n*''[[China Beach]]''\n*''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]''\n*''[[The Commish]]''\n*''[[E-Ring]]''\n*''[[Fantasy Island]]''\n*''[[G.P.]]''\n*''[[Heart of the City (TV series)|Heart of the City]]''\n*''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''\n*''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''\n*''[[Katts and Dog]]''\n*''[[Miami Vice]]''\n*''[[Murphy's Law (U.S. TV series)|Murphy's Law]]''\n*''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]''\n*''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''\n*''[[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)|Robin Hood]]''\n*''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]''\n*''[[T.J.

The series featured [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] as the voice of Nellie, with [[Tony Robinson]] as the narrator. A comic-book annual was released in 1991 in an attempt to further advertise the series, but the annual failed to attract a wide audience.\n\n==Plot==\nBased on the famous children's song, \"[[Nellie the Elephant]]\", the series revolves around a pink elephant named Nellie who is returning to her home in [[Mandalay]] after escaping from the circus. Throughout the series, she meets new characters and sometimes returns to the same places in her quest to return home, though curiously, all of her travels are within the United Kingdom.\n\nAnother recurring character is a [[Dick Dastardly]]-like Ringmaster keen to recapture Nellie at all costs and return her to the circus, but is continuously foiled by Nellie and her friends.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Nellie''' - A pink elephant and the main character with a fondness for [[currant bun]]s (which sometimes proves to be her undoing), Nellie escaped from the circus in an effort to return to [[Mandalay]] at all costs, travelling by train, taxi, bus, coach, plane and ship.

He tracks Nellie down in a town in \"Nellie at the Big Store\", the penultimate episode of the series and is dangerously close to catching her but she is able to flee in a balloon with the help of two Balloon Sellers.\n*'''Farmer Styles''' - A Farmer who Nellie encounters on her journey in the episode \"Nellie Visits a Farm\", She helps him find a stray sheep and he and his wife reward her with a large feast. Farmer Styles reappears in \"Nellie and the Burning Farm\" when his barn catches alight and Nellie helps extinguish the blaze.\n*'''Sergeant Boot'''\n*'''Captain Match''' - The chief of the Fire Brigade in the Neighbouring village to the Styles' farm.

In the English-speaking world, he was sometimes credited as Akim Berg or Berger.\n\n==Life and career==\nFuchsberger was born in Zuffenhausen, today a district of [[Stuttgart]], and was a member of the obligatory [[Hitler Youth]].<ref name=\"Heinze\">Vgl. ''Setzen, Sechs! \u2013 Schulgeschichten aus Deutschland (1/3). Verlorene Kindheit''. Documentary from Dora Heinze for SWR. German first broadcast on 8 December 2005 (German)</ref> During [[World War II]], at the age of 16, he was trained as a ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'', [[Hand-to-hand combat|combat instructor]] and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] where he was wounded. He was captured in a hospital in [[Stralsund]] by the [[Red Army]] and came into Soviet captivity and later in American and British captivity. Because of this turbulent time of his youth in Second World War, he could never make a school diploma.<ref name=\"Heinze\"/> In 1946, he worked as a [[coal miner]] for the British in [[Recklinghausen]]. His nickname Blacky hails from that time.\n\nAfter his release, he worked as an engineer for [[typesetting]] and printing machines in the family business and later in a publishing house in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In 1949, he was advertising manager of the German Building Exhibition in [[Nuremberg]]. From 1950 to 1952, he was spokesman at the radio station in Munich and newsreel spokesman. In 1951, he married the pop singer [[Gitta Lind]], from whom he divorced after two years. In 1954 he married the radio technician and actress Gundula Korte (born 24 March 1930), with whom he has a son. In the same year he had his breakthrough playing \"Gunner Asch\" in the three-part war film ''[[08/15 (film series)|08/15]]'' film series, based on the novel by [[Hans Hellmut Kirst]].\n\nAfter several war films, he starred in the 1959 film ''[[Der Frosch mit der Maske]]'' (The Frog with the Mask) playing amateur detective Richard Gordon. More than 3.2 million visitors saw the movie in the cinema. The surprising success laid the foundation for many other film adaptations of novels by [[Edgar Wallace]].\n\nAfter this success, he played the detective in another 12 Edgar Wallace films: 1960 \u2013 Chief Inspector Long in ''[[The Terrible People (1960 film)|The Terrible People]]''; 1961 \u2013 Inspector Larry Holt in ''[[The Dead Eyes of London]]''; 1961 \u2013 Insurance Agent Jack Tarling in ''[[The Devil's Daffodil]]''; 1961 \u2013 Inspector Mike Dorn in ''[[The Strange Countess]]''; 1962 \u2013 Inspector Wade in ''[[The Inn on the River]]''; 1963 \u2013 Clifford Lynne in ''{{ill|Der Fluch der gelben Schlange|de}}'' (The Curse of the Yellow Snake); 1963 \u2013 Estate manager Dick Alford in ''[[The Black Abbot (1963 film)|The Black Abbot]]''; 1964 \u2013 Investigator Johnny Gray in ''[[Room 13 (film)|Room 13]]''; 1964 \u2013 Inspector Higgins in ''[[Der Hexer (1964 film)|Der Hexer]]'' (The Warlock); 1967 \u2013 Inspector Higgins in ''[[The Monk with the Whip]]''; 1968 \u2013 Inspector Higgins in ''[[Im Banne des Unheimlichen]]'' (Under the Spell of the Sinister); 1972 \u2013 Inspector Barth in ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?]]''.\n\nFuchsberger was the stadium announcer for the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich. During the closing ceremony, it was suspected that a hijacked passenger aircraft was on its way to the stadium. Fuchsberger, fearing a panic, decided against evacuation. This decision was vindicated when the original suspicion turned out to have been false.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Fuchsberger co-founded a real estate company that went bankrupt in a short time. At 42, he had lost his entire fortune, had to sell his villa and sat on a mountain of debt. With the help of his wife, Gundula, good friends and tireless work, he managed to discharge the debt and to start a new existence.\n\nIn 1978, he was bitten by a [[chimpanzee]] during a TV show and fell seriously ill with hepatitis B. He spent 4 months at the quarantine station and suffered through a depression but recovered. He withdrew from film and television work in the late 1970s and concentrated on his stage career. In the late 1990s he started reappearing in some television movies, which after a break he continued from the late 2000s until his death.\n\nIn 1984, he was the first German ambassador for [[UNICEF]]. On 13 November 2006, he was awarded the Bavarian State Medal for Social Services for those activities.<ref>[http://www.whoswho.de/templ/te_bio.php?PID=215&RID=1 Joachim Fuchsberger Biografie], ''Who's Who'' (German)</ref> Since 2009, Fuchsberger is member of the Board of Trustees of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]] and co-patron of the volunteer program for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500014&tx_dfbnews_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=20414&tx_dfbnews_pi4%5Bcat%5D=167 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908210728/http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500014 |archive-date=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nHis son, {{ill|Thomas Fuchsberger|de|lt=Thomas}} (1957\u20132010), was a composer and drowned in [[Kulmbach]] on 14 October 2010.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/kulmbach-tod-im-muehlbach-sohn-von-blacky-fuchsberger-ertrunken-1.1012264 \"'Blacky' Fuchsberger trauert um Sohn\"], ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 15 October 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref> Late in life, Fuchsberger lived in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria|Gr\u00fcnwald]] near Munich and in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]], Hobart, Tasmania.

In the English-speaking world, he was sometimes credited as Akim Berg or Berger.\n\n==Life and career==\nFuchsberger was born in Zuffenhausen, today a district of [[Stuttgart]], and was a member of the obligatory [[Hitler Youth]].<ref name=\"Heinze\">Vgl. ''Setzen, Sechs! \u2013 Schulgeschichten aus Deutschland (1/3). Verlorene Kindheit''. Documentary from Dora Heinze for SWR. German first broadcast on 8 December 2005 (German)</ref> During [[World War II]], at the age of 16, he was trained as a ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'', [[Hand-to-hand combat|combat instructor]] and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] where he was wounded. He was captured in a hospital in [[Stralsund]] by the [[Red Army]] and came into Soviet captivity and later in American and British captivity. Because of this turbulent time of his youth in Second World War, he could never make a school diploma.<ref name=\"Heinze\"/> In 1946, he worked as a [[coal miner]] for the British in [[Recklinghausen]]. His nickname Blacky hails from that time.\n\nAfter his release, he worked as an engineer for [[typesetting]] and printing machines in the family business and later in a publishing house in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In 1949, he was advertising manager of the German Building Exhibition in [[Nuremberg]]. From 1950 to 1952, he was spokesman at the radio station in Munich and newsreel spokesman. In 1951, he married the pop singer [[Gitta Lind]], from whom he divorced after two years. In 1954 he married the radio technician and actress Gundula Korte (born 24 March 1930), with whom he has a son. In the same year he had his breakthrough playing \"Gunner Asch\" in the three-part war film ''[[08/15 (film series)|08/15]]'' film series, based on the novel by [[Hans Hellmut Kirst]].\n\nAfter several war films, he starred in the 1959 film ''[[Der Frosch mit der Maske]]'' (The Frog with the Mask) playing amateur detective Richard Gordon. More than 3.2 million visitors saw the movie in the cinema. The surprising success laid the foundation for many other film adaptations of novels by [[Edgar Wallace]].\n\nAfter this success, he played the detective in another 12 Edgar Wallace films: 1960 \u2013 Chief Inspector Long in ''[[The Terrible People (1960 film)|The Terrible People]]''; 1961 \u2013 Inspector Larry Holt in ''[[The Dead Eyes of London]]''; 1961 \u2013 Insurance Agent Jack Tarling in ''[[The Devil's Daffodil]]''; 1961 \u2013 Inspector Mike Dorn in ''[[The Strange Countess]]''; 1962 \u2013 Inspector Wade in ''[[The Inn on the River]]''; 1963 \u2013 Clifford Lynne in ''{{ill|Der Fluch der gelben Schlange|de}}'' (The Curse of the Yellow Snake); 1963 \u2013 Estate manager Dick Alford in ''[[The Black Abbot (1963 film)|The Black Abbot]]''; 1964 \u2013 Investigator Johnny Gray in ''[[Room 13 (film)|Room 13]]''; 1964 \u2013 Inspector Higgins in ''[[Der Hexer (1964 film)|Der Hexer]]'' (The Warlock); 1967 \u2013 Inspector Higgins in ''[[The Monk with the Whip]]''; 1968 \u2013 Inspector Higgins in ''[[Im Banne des Unheimlichen]]'' (Under the Spell of the Sinister); 1972 \u2013 Inspector Barth in ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?]]''.\n\nFuchsberger was the stadium announcer for the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich. During the closing ceremony, it was suspected that a hijacked passenger aircraft was on its way to the stadium. Fuchsberger, fearing a panic, decided against evacuation. This decision was vindicated when the original suspicion turned out to have been false.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Fuchsberger co-founded a real estate company that went bankrupt in a short time. At 42, he had lost his entire fortune, had to sell his villa and sat on a mountain of debt. With the help of his wife, Gundula, good friends and tireless work, he managed to discharge the debt and to start a new existence.\n\nIn 1978, he was bitten by a [[chimpanzee]] during a TV show and fell seriously ill with hepatitis B. He spent 4 months at the quarantine station and suffered through a depression but recovered. He withdrew from film and television work in the late 1970s and concentrated on his stage career. In the late 1990s he started reappearing in some television movies, which after a break he continued from the late 2000s until his death.\n\nIn 1984, he was the first German ambassador for [[UNICEF]]. On 13 November 2006, he was awarded the Bavarian State Medal for Social Services for those activities.<ref>[http://www.whoswho.de/templ/te_bio.php?PID=215&RID=1 Joachim Fuchsberger Biografie], ''Who's Who'' (German)</ref> Since 2009, Fuchsberger is member of the Board of Trustees of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]] and co-patron of the volunteer program for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500014&tx_dfbnews_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=20414&tx_dfbnews_pi4%5Bcat%5D=167 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908210728/http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500014 |archive-date=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nHis son, {{ill|Thomas Fuchsberger|de|lt=Thomas}} (1957\u20132010), was a composer and drowned in [[Kulmbach]] on 14 October 2010.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/kulmbach-tod-im-muehlbach-sohn-von-blacky-fuchsberger-ertrunken-1.1012264 \"'Blacky' Fuchsberger trauert um Sohn\"], ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 15 October 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref> Late in life, Fuchsberger lived in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria|Gr\u00fcnwald]] near Munich and in [[Sandy Bay, Tasmania|Sandy Bay]], Hobart, Tasmania.

Originally a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the 1984 single \"[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]\", \"How Soon Is Now?\" was subsequently featured on the compilation album ''[[Hatful of Hollow]]'' and on US, Canadian, Australian, and Warner UK editions of ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. Belatedly released as a single in the UK in 1985, it reached No. 24 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. When re-released in 1992, it reached No. 16.\n\nIn 2007, Marr said \"How Soon Is Now?\" is \"possibly [the Smiths'] most enduring record. It's most people's favourite, I think.\"<ref name=\"Uncut p.48\">''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', March 2007: p.48</ref> Despite its prominent place in the Smiths' repertoire, it is not generally considered to be representative of the band's style.<ref name=\"allmusic\">DiGravina, Tim. [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t830073|pure_url=yes}} \"How Soon Is Now?\" review]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 15 May 2009.</ref> Although a club favourite, it did not chart as well as expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; the 7\" single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations.\n\nA cover of the song by [[Love Spit Love]] was used in the soundtrack for the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' and later appeared as the theme song of the television series ''[[Charmed]]'' for eight seasons.\n\n==Origin and recording==\nSmiths guitarist Johnny Marr wrote \"How Soon Is Now?\" along with \"[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]\" and \"[[Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want]]\" during a four-day period at [[Earl's Court]] in London in June 1984.<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> His [[demo (music)|demo]] was originally called \"Swamp\". In contrast to the frequent chord changes he had employed in most Smiths' songs, Marr wanted to explore building a song around a single chord (in this case, F{{music|sharp}}) as much as possible, which also appealed to [[record producer|producer]] [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\">{{harvp|Fletcher|2013|pp=353\u201357}}</ref>\n\nMarr recorded the song with bandmates [[Andy Rourke]] and [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] that July at London's Jam Studios. After a night out celebrating the session for \"William, It Was Really Nothing\" and \"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\", the trio had reconvened the following afternoon to record what became \"How Soon Is Now?\" Porter was impressed by the basic riff Marr showed him, but felt the song needed something else. Their discussion turned to the early recordings of [[Elvis Presley]], which led to an impromptu jam session of the song \"[[That's All Right]]\". During the jam, Marr worked on his chord progression for \"Swamp\", which inspired the arrangement.<ref name=\"Goddard104\" />\n\nThey recall the session as being accompanied by heavy [[marijuana]] use. \"We used to smoke dope from when we got out of bed to when we got back to bed\", recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: \"You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes out of your ears.\" Joyce said the band even replaced the studio's light bulbs with red ones for [[:wikt:ambiance|ambience]].<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nPorter recorded the first takes with microphones set up at varying distances from the band to better create a \"swampy\" mood. Marr was able to keep the F{{music|sharp}} chord going for as long as 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] at a time. Despite only doing a few takes, they had filled an entire reel of tape, as one had gone on for 15 minutes.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nMarr and Porter decided to add a [[Tremolo (electronic effect)|tremolo]] effect to the guitar part. He was inspired by [[Bo Diddley]]'s distinctive [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[Swing (jazz performance style)#Swing note|shuffle]] guitar style, [[Hamilton Bohannon]]'s \"Disco Stomp\" and the two guitars in the instrumental break of [[Can (band)|Can]]'s \"[[I Want More (Can song)|I Want More]]\". The effect was created by running the original guitar track through the studio desk into three separate [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender_Twin|Twin Reverb]] amplifiers, each with the tremolo control (mislabeled as \"[[Vibrato#Vibrato_and_tremolo|vibrato]]\") set to a different oscillation speed. Marr and Porter would adjust each by hand while the music played to keep it in rhythm; when they failed, engineer Mark Wallis would rewind the tape and start them again. Some of these segments were no longer than ten seconds.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nTo make sure the beat was the same throughout the song, Porter took a [[noise gate]] and set it to be triggered by a drum machine, using percussion instruments Joyce typically did not, set to [[16th note]]s. This created what he called \"a swirling signal\" that balanced the analog tremolo effect and made sure the whole song stayed on the same beat. The guitar tracks were then \"bounced\" down to three of the master recording's 24 available tracks, and the 15-minute version was cut down to eight minutes. This was longer than any previous Smiths song had been. But, Porter told [[Tony Fletcher]], \"we looked at each other and said, 'It sounds fucking great; let's keep it like that.'\"<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nThe rhythm has been compared to Diddley's \"[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|Mona]]\", later covered by [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref name=\"Goddard105\">{{harvp|Goddard|2004|p=105}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first= Jon|last= Savage|authorlink= Jon Savage |title=The Smiths|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=June 1985|page=69}}</ref> After a break, Marr and Porter added a few overdubs, including a slide guitar part that \"gave [the song] real tension\", according to Marr.<ref name=\"Goddard105\"/> It was created using an early [[harmonizer]] that was also able to cache 1.2 seconds of [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], a very large amount for the time. Artists had been using it as a [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]; Porter says that he recorded the delay rather than the original to give it some \"weirdness\". He also says that he played one of the slide guitars; Marr disputes this but gives him credit for his leadership in recording the song.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nMarr's other lead guitar part was the [[guitar harmonic|harmonic]] [[lick (music)|lick]] after each verse. This is almost a direct quote of a synthetic [[vibraphone]] part heard on rapper [[Lovebug Starski]]'s \"You've Gotta Believe\", from the previous year. Marr meant it as a direct response to some critics who had pigeonholed the Smiths as 1960s revivalists.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nThat night Porter sent singer Morrissey a rough mix of the song in the mail. The following morning Morrissey arrived and laid down his vocals, culling lyrics from various works in progress in his notebook. According to Porter, Morrissey completed his vocals in two takes.<ref name=\"Goddard106\">{{harvp|Goddard|2004|p=106}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe song contains only one verse which is repeated twice, plus a chorus and a bridge. The subject is an individual who cannot find a way to overcome his crippling [[shyness]] and find a partner. Two couplets from the song are well known in pop culture, the opening to the verse:\n{{quote|I am the son, and the heir, of a shyness that is criminally vulgar<br />I am the son and heir, of nothing in particular}} and the chorus: {{quote|You shut your mouth<br />How can you say<br />I go about things the wrong way<br />I am human and I need to be loved<br />Just like everybody else does.}} The opening was adapted from a line in [[George Eliot]]'s novel ''[[Middlemarch]]'': \"To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular\".<ref name=\"Goddard106\" /> Music journalist [[Jon Savage]] commented that the song's lyrics were evocative of contemporary [[Manchester]] gay club culture.<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nThe tune is built around a guitar chord that rapidly [[Oscillation|oscillates]] in volume. As to how the distinctive resonant sound was achieved, Marr gave the following account in 1990:\n\n<blockquote>The vibrato [[Vibrato#Vibrato_and_tremolo|[tremolo]]] sound is incredible, and it took a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an [[Epiphone Casino]] through a [[Fender Twin Reverb]] without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps vibrating in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part \u2013 not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a [[harmonizer]], set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in [[harmonics]], I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.<ref>''Guitar Player'' magazine, January 1990.

Despite pressure from Porter to save the song for a later single release as an A-side, \"How Soon Is Now?\" was included as B-side on the 12\" single release of \"William, It Was Really Nothing\" in August 1984.<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|p=107}}</ref> According to Porter: \"I thought 'This is it!' ... but I don't think the record company liked it ... They totally threw it away, wasted it\".<ref>{{harvp|Rogan|1994|p=75}}</ref> Night-time British radio picked up on the song almost immediately, however, and by autumn it had become the most-requested track on request shows by DJs [[John Peel]], [[Janice Long]], and [[Annie Nightingale]].<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> It was subsequently included on the Smiths' [[compilation album]] ''[[Hatful of Hollow]]'', released on 12 November 1984. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film ''[[Out of Bounds (1986 film)|Out of Bounds]]'', but was not included on the accompanying soundtrack album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091706/soundtrack|title=Out of Bounds (1986)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe song was released on [[Sire Records]] in the United States, backed with \"Girl Afraid\", in November 1984. It was expected to sell well and, for the first time, a video was made to promote one of the band's tracks. However, the song failed to chart. [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] boss Geoff Travis blamed poor promotion: \"I can't understand why 'How Soon Is Now?' wasn't a top 10 single, but perhaps I'm being naive. If only their singles had been played on the radio\".<ref>{{harvp|Rogan|1994|p=103}}</ref> Morrissey expressed his disappointment in an interview with ''[[Creem]]'' magazine: \"It's hard to believe that 'How Soon Is Now?' was not a hit. I thought that was the one...\".<ref>''Creem'' magazine, 1987</ref>\n\"How Soon Is Now?\" was released as an A-side in the United Kingdom on 28 January 1985. The 7\" featured an edited version of the track, and the B-side was \"Well I Wonder\", from the about-to-be-released ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' album. The 12\" single included a new instrumental track, \"Oscillate Wildly\". It peaked at No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart, a lower placing than the band's three previous singles, which had all hit the Top 20; according to John Porter, \"Everybody knew the Smiths' fans already had it\".<ref name=\"Morrissey: The Albums\"/>\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Rough Trade catalogue by [[Warner Bros. Records]], \"How Soon Is Now?\" was issued again as a single in the United Kingdom in September 1992. A 7\" single and cassette featured the edited version, backed with a live version of \"[[Hatful of Hollow|Handsome Devil]]\", recorded at [[The Ha\u00e7ienda]] on 4 February 1983 (this had originally been the B-side to the Smiths' first single \"[[Hand in Glove]]\"). Two CD singles featured tracks from the Smiths' back-catalogue which were, following the demise of Rough Trade, unavailable in the United Kingdom at that time. The re-issue reached number 16 in the UK singles chart.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=AMG1>\"[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0001160333|pure_url=yes}} How Soon is Now rating]\".

The majestic ease of Morrissey's melancholic vocals are tinted with vitriol, as they move through vistas of misery with plaintive spirals around the pulse of Johnny Marr's tremolo guitar. The string's muted strains conjure wistful signs that bridge the schism between crass sentimentality and callous detachment. Each repeated phrase intensifies the hypnotic waves, with results that outflank anything since '[[This Charming Man]]'.

After initial reluctance, the band recorded the song, and it was released as a single from the movie's soundtrack in 1996.\n\nThe song became popular after [[The WB Television Network]] utilised the band's cover as the theme song for the [[witchcraft]]-themed television series ''[[Charmed]]''.<ref>Harris, Will. \"A Chat with Richard Butler\".  ''Bullz-Eye''.  16 April 2006.</ref> It was re-mixed for the show, with different instrumentation and vocals. The song went on to appear on ''[[Charmed: The Soundtrack]]'' (2003) and as a UK and Australian [[bonus track]] on ''[[Charmed: The Book of Shadows]]'' (2005). Both soundtrack albums charted well in the US, with both reaching the top ten on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Soundtracks chart.\n\nThe song has since become a staple of '90s popular culture, and has been used in numerous media, including the movie trailer for ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'', the film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' and the novel ''[[Eleanor & Park]]''.\n\n===Snake River Conspiracy===\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = How Soon is Now?\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| border     = yes\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Snake River Conspiracy]]\n| album      = [[Sonic Jihad (Snake River Conspiracy album)|Sonic Jihad]]\n| released   = [[2000 in music|2000]]\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   = 1999\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     = {{Duration|m=3|s=23}} (single version)\n| label      = [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Johnny Marr]]|[[Morrissey]]}}\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Snake River Conspiracy]]\n| prev_title = [[Vulcan (EP)|Vulcan]]\n| prev_year  = 1999\n| next_title = [[Smells Like Teen Punk Meat|Breed]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n}}\n\nThe song was covered by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Snake River Conspiracy]].

Their version was produced by [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] and [[Robert Orton (mix engineer)|Robert Orton]], with the original lyrics written by Marr and Morrissey. Upon the song's release, the song was considered a commercial success, compared to the original version. The song, however was never commercially released in the USA.\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from music critics, who felt it lacked originality, though compared to other covers, they praised this version as best. The song managed to have success on European music charts, peaking inside the top ten in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. An accompanying music video was issued for the group, featuring them performing the song in behind-the-scenes sessions and live performances.\n\n;Background and release\nWhile the duo was promoting singles off their studio album, the group decided to release \"[[Show Me Love (t.A.T.u. song)|Show Me Love]]\" as the album's third single. However, for unknown reasons, the song was dropped and the group's single \"[[30 Minutes (song)|30 Minutes]]\" was then proceeded as the replacement, despite its lack of success on record charts and airplay.\n\nThe single was released on 7 July 2003, only four weeks after the group's single \"30 Minutes\" was released. The song was available in different formats. The master CD single was released with the group's [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] entry \"[[Ne Ver', Ne Boysia]]\", a remix of \"30 Minutes\" and \"Not Gonna Get Us\". A promo CD was released in Japan, including \"Ya Soshla S Uma\" and a remix of \"All The Things She Said\". The song was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom in 2003, including \"Ne Ver', Ne Boysia\".\n\n;Critical reception\nt.A.T.u.'s cover of \"How Soon Is Now?\" received mixed reviews from music critics.

Originally a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the 1984 single \"[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]\", \"How Soon Is Now?\" was subsequently featured on the compilation album ''[[Hatful of Hollow]]'' and on US, Canadian, Australian, and Warner UK editions of ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. Belatedly released as a single in the UK in 1985, it reached No. 24 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. When re-released in 1992, it reached No. 16.\n\nIn 2007, Marr said \"How Soon Is Now?\" is \"possibly [the Smiths'] most enduring record. It's most people's favourite, I think.\"<ref name=\"Uncut p.48\">''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', March 2007: p.48</ref> Despite its prominent place in the Smiths' repertoire, it is not generally considered to be representative of the band's style.<ref name=\"allmusic\">DiGravina, Tim. [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t830073|pure_url=yes}} \"How Soon Is Now?\" review]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 15 May 2009.</ref> Although a club favourite, it did not chart as well as expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; the 7\" single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations.\n\nA cover of the song by [[Love Spit Love]] was used in the soundtrack for the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' and later appeared as the theme song of the television series ''[[Charmed]]'' for eight seasons.\n\n==Origin and recording==\nSmiths guitarist Johnny Marr wrote \"How Soon Is Now?\" along with \"[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]\" and \"[[Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want]]\" during a four-day period at [[Earl's Court]] in London in June 1984.<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> His [[demo (music)|demo]] was originally called \"Swamp\". In contrast to the frequent chord changes he had employed in most Smiths' songs, Marr wanted to explore building a song around a single chord (in this case, F{{music|sharp}}) as much as possible, which also appealed to [[record producer|producer]] [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\">{{harvp|Fletcher|2013|pp=353\u201357}}</ref>\n\nMarr recorded the song with bandmates [[Andy Rourke]] and [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] that July at London's Jam Studios. After a night out celebrating the session for \"William, It Was Really Nothing\" and \"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\", the trio had reconvened the following afternoon to record what became \"How Soon Is Now?\" Porter was impressed by the basic riff Marr showed him, but felt the song needed something else. Their discussion turned to the early recordings of [[Elvis Presley]], which led to an impromptu jam session of the song \"[[That's All Right]]\". During the jam, Marr worked on his chord progression for \"Swamp\", which inspired the arrangement.<ref name=\"Goddard104\" />\n\nThey recall the session as being accompanied by heavy [[marijuana]] use. \"We used to smoke dope from when we got out of bed to when we got back to bed\", recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: \"You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes out of your ears.\" Joyce said the band even replaced the studio's light bulbs with red ones for [[:wikt:ambiance|ambience]].<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nPorter recorded the first takes with microphones set up at varying distances from the band to better create a \"swampy\" mood. Marr was able to keep the F{{music|sharp}} chord going for as long as 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] at a time. Despite only doing a few takes, they had filled an entire reel of tape, as one had gone on for 15 minutes.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nMarr and Porter decided to add a [[Tremolo (electronic effect)|tremolo]] effect to the guitar part. He was inspired by [[Bo Diddley]]'s distinctive [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[Swing (jazz performance style)#Swing note|shuffle]] guitar style, [[Hamilton Bohannon]]'s \"Disco Stomp\" and the two guitars in the instrumental break of [[Can (band)|Can]]'s \"[[I Want More (Can song)|I Want More]]\". The effect was created by running the original guitar track through the studio desk into three separate [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender_Twin|Twin Reverb]] amplifiers, each with the tremolo control (mislabeled as \"[[Vibrato#Vibrato_and_tremolo|vibrato]]\") set to a different oscillation speed. Marr and Porter would adjust each by hand while the music played to keep it in rhythm; when they failed, engineer Mark Wallis would rewind the tape and start them again. Some of these segments were no longer than ten seconds.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nTo make sure the beat was the same throughout the song, Porter took a [[noise gate]] and set it to be triggered by a drum machine, using percussion instruments Joyce typically did not, set to [[16th note]]s. This created what he called \"a swirling signal\" that balanced the analog tremolo effect and made sure the whole song stayed on the same beat. The guitar tracks were then \"bounced\" down to three of the master recording's 24 available tracks, and the 15-minute version was cut down to eight minutes. This was longer than any previous Smiths song had been. But, Porter told [[Tony Fletcher]], \"we looked at each other and said, 'It sounds fucking great; let's keep it like that.'\"<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nThe rhythm has been compared to Diddley's \"[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|Mona]]\", later covered by [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref name=\"Goddard105\">{{harvp|Goddard|2004|p=105}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first= Jon|last= Savage|authorlink= Jon Savage |title=The Smiths|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=June 1985|page=69}}</ref> After a break, Marr and Porter added a few overdubs, including a slide guitar part that \"gave [the song] real tension\", according to Marr.<ref name=\"Goddard105\"/> It was created using an early [[harmonizer]] that was also able to cache 1.2 seconds of [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], a very large amount for the time. Artists had been using it as a [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]; Porter says that he recorded the delay rather than the original to give it some \"weirdness\". He also says that he played one of the slide guitars; Marr disputes this but gives him credit for his leadership in recording the song.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nMarr's other lead guitar part was the [[guitar harmonic|harmonic]] [[lick (music)|lick]] after each verse. This is almost a direct quote of a synthetic [[vibraphone]] part heard on rapper [[Lovebug Starski]]'s \"You've Gotta Believe\", from the previous year. Marr meant it as a direct response to some critics who had pigeonholed the Smiths as 1960s revivalists.<ref name=\"Fletcher353\u201357\" />\n\nThat night Porter sent singer Morrissey a rough mix of the song in the mail. The following morning Morrissey arrived and laid down his vocals, culling lyrics from various works in progress in his notebook. According to Porter, Morrissey completed his vocals in two takes.<ref name=\"Goddard106\">{{harvp|Goddard|2004|p=106}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe song contains only one verse which is repeated twice, plus a chorus and a bridge. The subject is an individual who cannot find a way to overcome his crippling [[shyness]] and find a partner. Two couplets from the song are well known in pop culture, the opening to the verse:\n{{quote|I am the son, and the heir, of a shyness that is criminally vulgar<br />I am the son and heir, of nothing in particular}} and the chorus: {{quote|You shut your mouth<br />How can you say<br />I go about things the wrong way<br />I am human and I need to be loved<br />Just like everybody else does.}} The opening was adapted from a line in [[George Eliot]]'s novel ''[[Middlemarch]]'': \"To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular\".<ref name=\"Goddard106\" /> Music journalist [[Jon Savage]] commented that the song's lyrics were evocative of contemporary [[Manchester]] gay club culture.<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nThe tune is built around a guitar chord that rapidly [[Oscillation|oscillates]] in volume. As to how the distinctive resonant sound was achieved, Marr gave the following account in 1990:\n\n<blockquote>The vibrato [[Vibrato#Vibrato_and_tremolo|[tremolo]]] sound is incredible, and it took a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an [[Epiphone Casino]] through a [[Fender Twin Reverb]] without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps vibrating in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part \u2013 not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a [[harmonizer]], set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in [[harmonics]], I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.<ref>''Guitar Player'' magazine, January 1990.

Despite pressure from Porter to save the song for a later single release as an A-side, \"How Soon Is Now?\" was included as B-side on the 12\" single release of \"William, It Was Really Nothing\" in August 1984.<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|p=107}}</ref> According to Porter: \"I thought 'This is it!' ... but I don't think the record company liked it ... They totally threw it away, wasted it\".<ref>{{harvp|Rogan|1994|p=75}}</ref> Night-time British radio picked up on the song almost immediately, however, and by autumn it had become the most-requested track on request shows by DJs [[John Peel]], [[Janice Long]], and [[Annie Nightingale]].<ref>{{harvp|Goddard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> It was subsequently included on the Smiths' [[compilation album]] ''[[Hatful of Hollow]]'', released on 12 November 1984. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film ''[[Out of Bounds (1986 film)|Out of Bounds]]'', but was not included on the accompanying soundtrack album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091706/soundtrack|title=Out of Bounds (1986)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe song was released on [[Sire Records]] in the United States, backed with \"Girl Afraid\", in November 1984. It was expected to sell well and, for the first time, a video was made to promote one of the band's tracks. However, the song failed to chart. [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] boss Geoff Travis blamed poor promotion: \"I can't understand why 'How Soon Is Now?' wasn't a top 10 single, but perhaps I'm being naive. If only their singles had been played on the radio\".<ref>{{harvp|Rogan|1994|p=103}}</ref> Morrissey expressed his disappointment in an interview with ''[[Creem]]'' magazine: \"It's hard to believe that 'How Soon Is Now?' was not a hit. I thought that was the one...\".<ref>''Creem'' magazine, 1987</ref>\n\"How Soon Is Now?\" was released as an A-side in the United Kingdom on 28 January 1985. The 7\" featured an edited version of the track, and the B-side was \"Well I Wonder\", from the about-to-be-released ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' album. The 12\" single included a new instrumental track, \"Oscillate Wildly\". It peaked at No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart, a lower placing than the band's three previous singles, which had all hit the Top 20; according to John Porter, \"Everybody knew the Smiths' fans already had it\".<ref name=\"Morrissey: The Albums\"/>\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Rough Trade catalogue by [[Warner Bros. Records]], \"How Soon Is Now?\" was issued again as a single in the United Kingdom in September 1992. A 7\" single and cassette featured the edited version, backed with a live version of \"[[Hatful of Hollow|Handsome Devil]]\", recorded at [[The Ha\u00e7ienda]] on 4 February 1983 (this had originally been the B-side to the Smiths' first single \"[[Hand in Glove]]\"). Two CD singles featured tracks from the Smiths' back-catalogue which were, following the demise of Rough Trade, unavailable in the United Kingdom at that time. The re-issue reached number 16 in the UK singles chart.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=AMG1>\"[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0001160333|pure_url=yes}} How Soon is Now rating]\".

Their version was produced by [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] and [[Robert Orton (mix engineer)|Robert Orton]], with the original lyrics written by Marr and Morrissey. Upon the song's release, the song was considered a commercial success, compared to the original version. The song, however was never commercially released in the USA.\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from music critics, who felt it lacked originality, though compared to other covers, they praised this version as best. The song managed to have success on European music charts, peaking inside the top ten in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. An accompanying music video was issued for the group, featuring them performing the song in behind-the-scenes sessions and live performances.\n\n;Background and release\nWhile the duo was promoting singles off their studio album, the group decided to release \"[[Show Me Love (t.A.T.u. song)|Show Me Love]]\" as the album's third single. However, for unknown reasons, the song was dropped and the group's single \"[[30 Minutes (song)|30 Minutes]]\" was then proceeded as the replacement, despite its lack of success on record charts and airplay.\n\nThe single was released on 7 July 2003, only four weeks after the group's single \"30 Minutes\" was released. The song was available in different formats. The master CD single was released with the group's [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] entry \"[[Ne Ver', Ne Boysia]]\", a remix of \"30 Minutes\" and \"Not Gonna Get Us\". A promo CD was released in Japan, including \"Ya Soshla S Uma\" and a remix of \"All The Things She Said\". The song was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom in 2003, including \"Ne Ver', Ne Boysia\".\n\n;Critical reception\nt.A.T.u.'s cover of \"How Soon Is Now?\" received mixed reviews from music critics.

Settling in Philadelphia by 1925, he took a job working as a janitor. In his free time, he continued his art career and used his talent to create emblems, like for the North Philadelphia Businessmen's Association, and posters in exhibitions and festivals, including the 2nd Annual National Negro Music Festival and the Tra Club of Philadelphia.<ref name=Donnelly/> This gained him local recognition and opened doors for new artistic endeavors.

Gallagher and Hubert Mesibov, began experimenting and co-inventing the process of carborundum mezzotint, a printmaking technique.<ref name=Donnelly/> [[Carborundum printmaking]] uses a carbon-based abrasive to burnish copper plates creating an image that can produce a print in tones ranging from pale gray to deep black.  The method is similar to the more difficult and complicated [[mezzotint]] process developed in the 17th century. He used this as his primary medium for much of his career and created his greatest works with it. One of his first pieces employing this nascent technique was his anonymous self-portrait entitled ''Mr. X''.\n\nWith this new technique, the three gained increasing notoriety as they published more and more graphics within newspapers and featured more and more pieces within exhibitions. Their works often featured subtle commentaries about social and economic exploitation regarding the contemporary politics - of the Great Depression and the Second World War. By 1940, Thrash, Gallagher, and Mesibov all began to gain attention in local circles for their carborundum prints, although the role that each artist played in the development of the process was left unclear.<ref name=\"John W.\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47785679|title=Dox Thrash : an African American master printmaker rediscovered|last=Ittmann|first=John W.|date=2001|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|others=Philadelphia Museum of Art., Terra Museum of American Art.|isbn=0295981598|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=47785679}}</ref>\n\nThrash spent the later years of his life mentoring young African American artists.

He explained \u201cThe Negro physiognomy must be freshly and objectively conceived on its own patterns if it is ever to be seriously and importantly interpreted. Art must discover and reveal the beauty which prejudice and caricature have overlaid.\u201d<ref name=\"Locke\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newnegro00lock|title=The New Negro|last=Locke|first=Alain LeRoy|date=1992|publisher=Maxwell Macmillan|isbn=978-0-689-70821-3|oclc=505708001|url-access=registration}}</ref> What Locke is expressing here is not only the call for black artists to overcome racial prejudices via positive artistic representations of blacks, but that the actual African American individual like Thrash portrayed the lives of fellow blacks, and had the power to propagate this idea of the New Negro, as Locke explains, \u201cThere is the possibility that the sensitive artistic mind of the American Negro, stimulated by a cultural pride and interest, will receive\u2026a profound and galvanizing influence.\u201d<ref name=\"Brigham\">{{Cite article|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/bridging-identities-dox-thrash-as-african-american-and-artist/oclc/5966451556&referer=brief_results|title=Bridging Identities: Dox Thrash as African American and Artist|last=Brigham|first=David R|date=1992|issn=0890-4901|}}</ref>\n\nIn his shadowy carborundum mezzotint ''Cabin Days'', Thrash depicts a southern black family on the porch of their shack-like home in a rural landscape. The man, woman, and child, clutched tenderly to the female figure's breast, create an intimate scene highlighted by the bright cleanliness of the laundry hanging behind them. Placed in front of the drying laundry, they are framed by one aspect of the hard work accomplished during the day. Close to one another, staring collectively outward at the Southern landscape, they, and their laudable priorities of cleanliness and family, are made the bright focal point in the poor, unstable atmosphere. Such inner warmth is seemingly incompatible with the family's crooked and disheveled surroundings, and their fuzzy appearance with a lack of facial detail makes the scene into a general archetype for rural southern blacks living conditions and qualities. Thrash was referencing an experience common to thousands of black families in rural occupations at the turn of the 20th century, often forced into slavery-like tenant farming as their only means of livelihood in the racist South. The \u201cuneven clapboards, leaning porch, broken shutter, and uprooted fence\u201d are rife with instability, much like the post-slavery economic and social systems of the South, making it clear that for African Americans, \u201cthe house is not the home; rather, the figures on the porch represent family unity and continuity\u201d.<ref name=\"Brigham\"/> In this way, Thrash is able to not only champion the positive qualities of blacks in the family setting but underscore this with a symbolic look at their disadvantaged situation, making it all the more impressive that they persevere. Thrash symbolically depicted harsh realities for the African American at this transitional point in history while conferring a sensitive rendering of their humanity, akin to any other race, despite its utter denial by American society.\n\nThrough softer tempera washes like ''A New Day'', he literally and figuratively paints a picture of a black family transitioning from the South to the North during the Great Migration, making a hopeful, daring leap to attempt to be equal members of the society that has historically oppressed them. On the left side of the canvas lie muddled farm houses and plow handles, embodiments of their rural life of tedious hard labor behind them, fading to gray. Their hopeful gazes \u201c\u2026convey the optimism of the scores of African Americans who left the countryside to pursue better job opportunities, health care, and education in urban centers\u201d.<ref name=\"John W.\"/> The stance of the figures, with their chins raised in a dignified gesture towards cityscape ahead suggest a confidence and ambitiousness in their collective futures in this new northern industrial terrain. Even the child, clutched securely in the arm of the mother figure against her breast is not only serenely grinning, but calm enough to appear to gently doze, confident in that the journey ahead will result positively, poses no threat. The exposed arm of the woman is notable as well, being unusually thick and muscular, along with the general proportions of the kneeling father, who position on the ground appears not pleading but rather in a slightly exhausted, but upright gratefulness for the promise ahead. Thrash makes it clear that this family has traveled a long way, but is not depleted; rather they are strong and preparing for further hard work and hopeful success ahead. They are the quintessence of the New Negro, in that they are not only journeying forward to seize previously unobtainable opportunities that will enhance their lives, but the manner with which they hold themselves provokes a certain level of warranted respect for their humanity, from the viewer.\n\nIn fact it was the strength of his fellow African Americans that Thrash often emphasized, amongst other positive characteristics in the face of adversity in personal portraits.  Through his carborundum print ''Life'', he depicts a neatly dressed black girl reading what appears to be a newspaper or magazine. The subject stares intently at her material, fixated on the abundance of text. Art historian Richard Powell describes it best, stating that Life's \u201cnon-racial genre scene, soft sells that Black children, too, experience the thrills and tender moments of youth. These underlying themes of commonalities and unity contribute to an aesthetic of being part of a larger system as opposed to being separate from it.\u201d<ref name=\"Brigham\"/> Thrash's conscious decision to not only give specific attention to a black subject through a portrait, but to place the child as engaging in an intellectual pursuit that crosses racial borders enforces a positive view of African Americans as intelligent, integral members of society akin to whites. The lighting of the print adds to this effect as well. The room in which the girl sits is dark and shadowy, however, the light source shines directly upon her face and lap, emphasizing her beautifully carved young features engrossed in the reading material. In addition, her social status is touched upon by her clean, well-tailored, and fashionable dress of the day. Her literacy is therefore inextricably interwoven with her personal and familial success. She is the antithesis to Locke's idea of the caricature of blacks whose poses and exaggerated features were made to dehumanize and convey a diminished sense of intelligence and capability.\n\nThrash also acknowledged common cultural clashes and challenges faced by African Americans through his portraiture as well. In his etching ''Saturday Night'', he depicts a female hairdresser readying herself for a night on the town.

The woman is straightening her naturally curly hair with a hot iron. She is conforming to physical standards foisted upon her by the dominant white society where straight hair is a marker of beauty. Though muscular, shapely, and attractive, she feels the need to engage in the laborious task of making her tightly coiled hair straight in order to prepare for the night in the public sphere.

This technique of etching lends a weariness or faded quality to the entire piece, the woman and her world appearing to be worn down to a mere skeleton of their realities.

It is as if Thrash was literally reflecting his African American audience back at themselves, hinting at the psychological expense of attempting to conform to pre-existing white norms. Such an activity, though on the surface merely a shallow process of beautification, carries with it the idea of rejecting your natural physical state, or rather one's blackness. To Locke and Thrash, this was not viewed as positive for African Americans considering that it the connotation of such an act of conforming to the aesthetic norms of white society puts the natural condition of blacks in a categorization of less than optimal, or ugly. Such a sentiment does not produce pride for the community or bolster the idea of the New Negro.

Settling in Philadelphia by 1925, he took a job working as a janitor. In his free time, he continued his art career and used his talent to create emblems, like for the North Philadelphia Businessmen's Association, and posters in exhibitions and festivals, including the 2nd Annual National Negro Music Festival and the Tra Club of Philadelphia.<ref name=Donnelly/> This gained him local recognition and opened doors for new artistic endeavors. By 1929, Thrash found himself attending nightly classes within these clubs, namely with Earl Horter of the Graphic Sketch Club, now known as the [[Samuel S.

Gallagher and Hubert Mesibov, began experimenting and co-inventing the process of carborundum mezzotint, a printmaking technique.<ref name=Donnelly/> [[Carborundum printmaking]] uses a carbon-based abrasive to burnish copper plates creating an image that can produce a print in tones ranging from pale gray to deep black.  The method is similar to the more difficult and complicated [[mezzotint]] process developed in the 17th century. He used this as his primary medium for much of his career and created his greatest works with it. One of his first pieces employing this nascent technique was his anonymous self-portrait entitled ''Mr. X''.\n\nWith this new technique, the three gained increasing notoriety as they published more and more graphics within newspapers and featured more and more pieces within exhibitions. Their works often featured subtle commentaries about social and economic exploitation regarding the contemporary politics - of the Great Depression and the Second World War. By 1940, Thrash, Gallagher, and Mesibov all began to gain attention in local circles for their carborundum prints, although the role that each artist played in the development of the process was left unclear.<ref name=\"John W.\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47785679|title=Dox Thrash : an African American master printmaker rediscovered|last=Ittmann|first=John W.|date=2001|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|others=Philadelphia Museum of Art., Terra Museum of American Art.|isbn=0295981598|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=47785679}}</ref>\n\nThrash spent the later years of his life mentoring young African American artists.

He explained \u201cThe Negro physiognomy must be freshly and objectively conceived on its own patterns if it is ever to be seriously and importantly interpreted. Art must discover and reveal the beauty which prejudice and caricature have overlaid.\u201d<ref name=\"Locke\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newnegro00lock|title=The New Negro|last=Locke|first=Alain LeRoy|date=1992|publisher=Maxwell Macmillan|isbn=978-0-689-70821-3|oclc=505708001|url-access=registration}}</ref> What Locke is expressing here is not only the call for black artists to overcome racial prejudices via positive artistic representations of blacks, but that the actual African American individual like Thrash portrayed the lives of fellow blacks, and had the power to propagate this idea of the New Negro, as Locke explains, \u201cThere is the possibility that the sensitive artistic mind of the American Negro, stimulated by a cultural pride and interest, will receive\u2026a profound and galvanizing influence.\u201d<ref name=\"Brigham\">{{Cite article|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/bridging-identities-dox-thrash-as-african-american-and-artist/oclc/5966451556&referer=brief_results|title=Bridging Identities: Dox Thrash as African American and Artist|last=Brigham|first=David R|date=1992|issn=0890-4901|}}</ref>\n\nIn his shadowy carborundum mezzotint ''Cabin Days'', Thrash depicts a southern black family on the porch of their shack-like home in a rural landscape. The man, woman, and child, clutched tenderly to the female figure's breast, create an intimate scene highlighted by the bright cleanliness of the laundry hanging behind them. Placed in front of the drying laundry, they are framed by one aspect of the hard work accomplished during the day. Close to one another, staring collectively outward at the Southern landscape, they, and their laudable priorities of cleanliness and family, are made the bright focal point in the poor, unstable atmosphere. Such inner warmth is seemingly incompatible with the family's crooked and disheveled surroundings, and their fuzzy appearance with a lack of facial detail makes the scene into a general archetype for rural southern blacks living conditions and qualities. Thrash was referencing an experience common to thousands of black families in rural occupations at the turn of the 20th century, often forced into slavery-like tenant farming as their only means of livelihood in the racist South. The \u201cuneven clapboards, leaning porch, broken shutter, and uprooted fence\u201d are rife with instability, much like the post-slavery economic and social systems of the South, making it clear that for African Americans, \u201cthe house is not the home; rather, the figures on the porch represent family unity and continuity\u201d.<ref name=\"Brigham\"/> In this way, Thrash is able to not only champion the positive qualities of blacks in the family setting but underscore this with a symbolic look at their disadvantaged situation, making it all the more impressive that they persevere. Thrash symbolically depicted harsh realities for the African American at this transitional point in history while conferring a sensitive rendering of their humanity, akin to any other race, despite its utter denial by American society.\n\nThrough softer tempera washes like ''A New Day'', he literally and figuratively paints a picture of a black family transitioning from the South to the North during the Great Migration, making a hopeful, daring leap to attempt to be equal members of the society that has historically oppressed them. On the left side of the canvas lie muddled farm houses and plow handles, embodiments of their rural life of tedious hard labor behind them, fading to gray. Their hopeful gazes \u201c\u2026convey the optimism of the scores of African Americans who left the countryside to pursue better job opportunities, health care, and education in urban centers\u201d.<ref name=\"John W.\"/> The stance of the figures, with their chins raised in a dignified gesture towards cityscape ahead suggest a confidence and ambitiousness in their collective futures in this new northern industrial terrain. Even the child, clutched securely in the arm of the mother figure against her breast is not only serenely grinning, but calm enough to appear to gently doze, confident in that the journey ahead will result positively, poses no threat. The exposed arm of the woman is notable as well, being unusually thick and muscular, along with the general proportions of the kneeling father, who position on the ground appears not pleading but rather in a slightly exhausted, but upright gratefulness for the promise ahead. Thrash makes it clear that this family has traveled a long way, but is not depleted; rather they are strong and preparing for further hard work and hopeful success ahead. They are the quintessence of the New Negro, in that they are not only journeying forward to seize previously unobtainable opportunities that will enhance their lives, but the manner with which they hold themselves provokes a certain level of warranted respect for their humanity, from the viewer.\n\nIn fact it was the strength of his fellow African Americans that Thrash often emphasized, amongst other positive characteristics in the face of adversity in personal portraits.  Through his carborundum print ''Life'', he depicts a neatly dressed black girl reading what appears to be a newspaper or magazine. The subject stares intently at her material, fixated on the abundance of text. Art historian Richard Powell describes it best, stating that Life's \u201cnon-racial genre scene, soft sells that Black children, too, experience the thrills and tender moments of youth. These underlying themes of commonalities and unity contribute to an aesthetic of being part of a larger system as opposed to being separate from it.\u201d<ref name=\"Brigham\"/> Thrash's conscious decision to not only give specific attention to a black subject through a portrait, but to place the child as engaging in an intellectual pursuit that crosses racial borders enforces a positive view of African Americans as intelligent, integral members of society akin to whites. The lighting of the print adds to this effect as well. The room in which the girl sits is dark and shadowy, however, the light source shines directly upon her face and lap, emphasizing her beautifully carved young features engrossed in the reading material. In addition, her social status is touched upon by her clean, well-tailored, and fashionable dress of the day. Her literacy is therefore inextricably interwoven with her personal and familial success. She is the antithesis to Locke's idea of the caricature of blacks whose poses and exaggerated features were made to dehumanize and convey a diminished sense of intelligence and capability.\n\nThrash also acknowledged common cultural clashes and challenges faced by African Americans through his portraiture as well. In his etching ''Saturday Night'', he depicts a female hairdresser readying herself for a night on the town. Her facial features and coloring distinctly label her as African American, and it is the act she is engaging in that is of utmost importance. The woman is straightening her naturally curly hair with a hot iron. She is conforming to physical standards foisted upon her by the dominant white society where straight hair is a marker of beauty. Though muscular, shapely, and attractive, she feels the need to engage in the laborious task of making her tightly coiled hair straight in order to prepare for the night in the public sphere. In fact, weariness at the task is written all over her face, the scratchy lines of the etching giving heavy shadow to the area underneath her eyes and the lines touching from her nostrils till the outsides of her lips. This technique of etching lends a weariness or faded quality to the entire piece, the woman and her world appearing to be worn down to a mere skeleton of their realities.  Her left leg casually draped across her right and the ease with which she appears to hold the straightening tool signify the routine quality of this preparation, despite her apparent dissatisfaction at the procedure. Throughout all of this, she directly confronts the viewer with a strong gaze, as if the audience is her mirror. It is as if Thrash was literally reflecting his African American audience back at themselves, hinting at the psychological expense of attempting to conform to pre-existing white norms. Such an activity, though on the surface merely a shallow process of beautification, carries with it the idea of rejecting your natural physical state, or rather one's blackness. To Locke and Thrash, this was not viewed as positive for African Americans considering that it the connotation of such an act of conforming to the aesthetic norms of white society puts the natural condition of blacks in a categorization of less than optimal, or ugly. Such a sentiment does not produce pride for the community or bolster the idea of the New Negro. However, Thrash's acknowledgement of the common practice, reflecting it back to the community, is a step towards progressing towards a more positive, independent state.\n\n==Relation to W.E.B.
