The critical praise given to ''Fabulous Disaster'' garnered attention from major labels, including [[Capitol Records]], with whom Exodus signed in 1989. The band released two more studio albums (''[[Impact Is Imminent]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992) before disbanding in 1994. After temporarily reuniting in 1997\u20131998, Exodus reformed once again in 2001, and since then, they have released five more studio albums, the most recent being ''[[Blood In, Blood Out (Exodus album)|Blood In, Blood Out]]'' (2014).

The band added bass guitarist Carlton Melson in 1980, and the quintet began making a name for themselves playing backyard parties and various school functions. They played mostly cover songs in the vein of 1970s hard rock and [[New wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) acts but also developed some of their own original songs. Stewart soon left the band and Hunting became the band's sole vocalist for some time. Carlton Melson was replaced in 1981 by bass guitarist Geoff Andrews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carlton Melson interview|url=http://pestwebzine.com/index/carlton_melson/0-1457}}</ref> Tim Agnello would also leave the group, moving to New York City and staying involved in the music industry as a guitar player, manager, and writer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Agnello interview|url=https://www.cmalliance.org/alife/you-can-call-me-al/}}</ref> This left Exodus to perform as a power trio until a replacement was found in Hammett's friend and Exodus roadie [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvMDgl0z_ZA|title = Exodus / Slayer's Gary Holt \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date = April 8, 2015|accessdate = November 18, 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = LoudWire|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1981, Hammett met El Cerrito resident [[Paul Baloff]] at a North Berkeley house party, a friendship that was started \u2013 according to Hammett \u2013 by their shared admiration for punk rock and 1970s heavy metal music. Baloff became the band's lead vocalist and the quintet recorded a 3-track demo tape in 1982 consisting of the songs \"Whipping Queen\", \"Death and Domination\" and \"Warlord\", a release which would be Hammett's only recording with Exodus. The band's music began to incorporate elements of [[hardcore punk]] into their NWOBHM roots, and Exodus was considered a pioneer of the [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene. In November 1982, Exodus opened a show at San Francisco's [[Old Waldorf]] venue for [[Metallica]],<ref>[http://www.encycmet.com/live/26.shtml ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA \u2013 Concert Info: San Francisco, Old Waldorf California Nov 29, 1982] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604222532/http://encycmet.com/live/26.shtml |date=June 4, 2009}}</ref> a then-relatively unknown (and unsigned) band from Los Angeles. As the band began playing more shows in Bay Area clubs, they gained a large, fervent fan base known for their violent concert behavior.\n\nIn early 1983, Hammett left Exodus to join [[Metallica]] on the recommendation of manager / producer [[Mark Whitaker (record producer)|Mark Whitaker]], leaving Gary Holt to effectively take creative control of the band. Hammett was replaced short term by Mike Maung, followed by [[Evan McCaskey]], before the band finally found a permanent replacement in guitarist [[Rick Hunolt]]. Geoff Andrews also left to start an early incarnation of pioneering [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], and was replaced by bass guitarist Rob McKillop.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, Exodus entered Turk Street Studios with producer [[Doug Piercy]] to record demos of songs that would later appear on their debut album. The band was signed to New York-based Torrid Records and Exodus prepared to enter [[Prairie Sun Recording Studios]] that summer.\n\n===''Bonded By Blood'' and rise in popularity (1984\u20131991)===\n[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 30.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Steve Souza|Steve \"Zetro\" Souza]], who replaced [[Paul Baloff]], was a member of Exodus from 1986 to their first breakup in 1994, and again from 2002 to 2004. He rejoined the band once again in 2014.]]\nThe band recorded their first album, ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'', in the summer of 1984 with the band's manager [[Mark Whitaker (music producer)|Mark Whitaker]] producing. 1984 concert photos from Exodus shows at [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]]'s Eastern Front Metal Festival (with [[Slayer]] and [[Suicidal Tendencies]]) and [[Bay Area thrash metal#Ruthie's Inn, Berkeley|Ruthie's Inn]] (with [[Megadeth]] and Slayer) were included on the album sleeve inserts. Originally titled ''A Lesson in Violence'', the album was not released until April 1985 amidst creative and business setbacks. Whilst ''Bonded By Blood'' is considered a highly influential [[thrash metal]] album today, critics have regarded the delay in its release as having hindered the impact the album could have had. As Allmusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia would later write in his review for the album: \"Had it been released immediately after it was recorded in 1984, Exodus' ''Bonded by Blood'' might be regarded today alongside [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' as one of the landmark albums responsible for launching the thrash metal wave.\"<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|author=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bonded-by-blood-mw0000192933 |title=Bonded by Blood \u2013 Exodus &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref> Exodus promoted the album by going on tour with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Slayer]]. Four songs from their performance of April 5, 1985 at Studio 54 in New York City were filmed and released on home video as ''Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge''. The band subsequently toured or played selected shows with bands like [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Nuclear Assault]] and [[Hirax]].\n\nShortly after touring for ''Bonded by Blood'' was complete, Paul Baloff was fired from the band allegedly due to his behavior related to alcohol and substance abuse, and was replaced by [[Steve Souza|Steve \"Zetro\" Souza]], who had previously been the lead vocalist for Legacy, an early incarnation of fellow Bay Area thrashers [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. Baloff went on to form the band Piranha in 1987.\n\nExodus' line-up remained stable for the recording of their next two albums, and the underground success attained with ''Bonded by Blood'' would lead to the group's signing to [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[Combat Records]], who released the band's second effort ''[[Pleasures of the Flesh]]'' in 1987. The album was engineered by then-unknown [[Sylvia Massy]], who would go on to produce two releases by progressive metal band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. In support of ''Pleasures of the Flesh'', Exodus toured with the likes of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[M.O.D.]], [[L\u0227\u0227z Rockit]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].\n\n''[[Fabulous Disaster]]'', the group's third full-length album, was released in 1989. A [[music video]] for the song \"[[The Toxic Waltz (song)|The Toxic Waltz]]\" would receive consistent rotation on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |title=The History of American Thrash |publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver.com]] |accessdate=September 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083043/http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |archivedate=November 25, 2010}}</ref> While promoting ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus embarked on the [[Headbangers Ball Tour|Headbangers Ball]] tour with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Helloween]], which brought the band to a wider audience.\n\nAfter the success of ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1989, who released the band's fourth album ''[[Impact is Imminent]]'' the following year. Prior to recording the album, Tom Hunting left the band for personal reasons; he was replaced by [[John Tempesta]] on drums. In 1991, the band released their first live album, ''[[Good Friendly Violent Fun]]'', which was recorded during their 1989 tour.\n\n===''Force of Habit'', hiatus, and temporary reunion (1991\u20132000)===\n[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 33.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jack Gibson joined Exodus in 1997 as bass guitarist and has been with the group ever since.]]\n\nAfter the release of ''Good Friendly Violent Fun'', the band toured sporadically for a year. Bass guitarist McKillop was replaced by Michael Butler before the group recorded and released their next studio album titled ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992. This album was something of a departure from the band's signature sound, containing several slower, \"heavier\" songs with less emphasis on the thrash aspect of their older material. The 11-minute song \"Architect of Pain\" is a good example of the change of direction, having a much slower, grinding feel than the usual high tempo thrash they had become known for. After touring for ''Force of Habit'' was completed, behind-the-scenes issues as well as a changing musical environment prompted the band to split up.\n\nHolt and Hunting formed the groove / thrash metal outfit Wardance in the mid 1990s playing several shows around the Bay Area and recording a 4-song demo, but the group never gained momentum and eventually disbanded.\n\nHolt and Hunting reunited with Paul Baloff and Rick Hunolt for a short Exodus tour in 1997. The lineup was completed with Wardance bassist Jack Gibson. They released a live album titled ''[[Another Lesson in Violence]]'' recorded at the [[Trocadero Transfer]] in front of a home town audience. However, the group disbanded again the following year, in part due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way promotion for the live album was handled, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.\n\n===Second reformation, death of Paul Baloff and ''Tempo of the Damned'' (2001\u20132004)===\nIn 2001, Exodus reformed once again with the 1997 lineup, initially to play the [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]] and [[Chuck Schuldiner]] benefit [[Thrash of the Titans]] concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play shows in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHowever, on February 2, 2002, Paul Baloff died after suffering a stroke. Former vocalist Steve Souza was brought back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments. Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio album. The result was 2004's ''[[Tempo of the Damned]]'' released on [[Nuclear Blast Records]]. An oddity of the recording sessions was that one track, \"Crime of the Century\", was dropped under mysterious circumstances. The song chronicled Exodus's time under Century Media (of which Nuclear Blast is a subsidiary). Although it was publicly denied, rumors swirled that Century Media forced the song off the record. \"Crime of the Century\" was replaced with \"Impaler\", a song which was written when Kirk Hammett was still in the band, and was previously featured on the ''Another Lesson in Violence'' live record.\n\n===Feud with Steve Souza, new members and ''Shovel Headed Kill Machine'' (2004\u20132006)===\n[[File:Rob Dukes, Exodus 5.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Rob Dukes]] was one of three new members to join Exodus in 2005.

Tom Hunting also took leave of the band following a re-occurrence of the nervous problems that led to his temporary departure in 1989. Hunting was replaced with [[Paul Bostaph]] who had previously played with [[Slayer]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. The revamped line up released the album ''[[Shovel Headed Kill Machine]]'' in 2005. The tour for the album led to extensive travel of the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as their first-ever visit to Australia.\n\n===Reunion with Tom Hunting and the ''Exhibit'' albums (2007\u20132013)===\nTom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007 in time to record and release their 8th studio album ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A]]''. They performed at the [[Wacken Open Air]] Festival in the summer of 2008. In April 2009, Exodus embarked on a co-headlining North American tour with [[Kreator]] and also featuring [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]], [[Warbringer]], and Epicurean. Exodus then went on tour supporting [[Arch Enemy]] along with [[Arsis]] and [[Mutiny Within]].\n\nExodus provided the voices of the customers at the Duncan Hills Coffee Shop and five of the sick people in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.\n\nExodus released a re-recording of their 1985 debut album ''Bonded by Blood'' entitled ''[[Let There Be Blood]]'' in 2008. Gary Holt released the following statement about the band's decision to revisit their debut album: \"After many years in the planning and discussion stage, we have finally completed the re-recording of 'Bonded By Blood'. We have decided to call it 'Let There Be Blood' and it is our way of paying homage to [late singer] Paul Baloff by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are.

The critical praise given to ''Fabulous Disaster'' garnered attention from major labels, including [[Capitol Records]], with whom Exodus signed in 1989. The band released two more studio albums (''[[Impact Is Imminent]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992) before disbanding in 1994.

The band added bass guitarist Carlton Melson in 1980, and the quintet began making a name for themselves playing backyard parties and various school functions. They played mostly cover songs in the vein of 1970s hard rock and [[New wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) acts but also developed some of their own original songs. Stewart soon left the band and Hunting became the band's sole vocalist for some time. Carlton Melson was replaced in 1981 by bass guitarist Geoff Andrews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carlton Melson interview|url=http://pestwebzine.com/index/carlton_melson/0-1457}}</ref> Tim Agnello would also leave the group, moving to New York City and staying involved in the music industry as a guitar player, manager, and writer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Agnello interview|url=https://www.cmalliance.org/alife/you-can-call-me-al/}}</ref> This left Exodus to perform as a power trio until a replacement was found in Hammett's friend and Exodus roadie [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvMDgl0z_ZA|title = Exodus / Slayer's Gary Holt \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date = April 8, 2015|accessdate = November 18, 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = LoudWire|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1981, Hammett met El Cerrito resident [[Paul Baloff]] at a North Berkeley house party, a friendship that was started \u2013 according to Hammett \u2013 by their shared admiration for punk rock and 1970s heavy metal music. Baloff became the band's lead vocalist and the quintet recorded a 3-track demo tape in 1982 consisting of the songs \"Whipping Queen\", \"Death and Domination\" and \"Warlord\", a release which would be Hammett's only recording with Exodus. The band's music began to incorporate elements of [[hardcore punk]] into their NWOBHM roots, and Exodus was considered a pioneer of the [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene. In November 1982, Exodus opened a show at San Francisco's [[Old Waldorf]] venue for [[Metallica]],<ref>[http://www.encycmet.com/live/26.shtml ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA \u2013 Concert Info: San Francisco, Old Waldorf California Nov 29, 1982] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604222532/http://encycmet.com/live/26.shtml |date=June 4, 2009}}</ref> a then-relatively unknown (and unsigned) band from Los Angeles. As the band began playing more shows in Bay Area clubs, they gained a large, fervent fan base known for their violent concert behavior.\n\nIn early 1983, Hammett left Exodus to join [[Metallica]] on the recommendation of manager / producer [[Mark Whitaker (record producer)|Mark Whitaker]], leaving Gary Holt to effectively take creative control of the band. Hammett was replaced short term by Mike Maung, followed by [[Evan McCaskey]], before the band finally found a permanent replacement in guitarist [[Rick Hunolt]]. Geoff Andrews also left to start an early incarnation of pioneering [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], and was replaced by bass guitarist Rob McKillop.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, Exodus entered Turk Street Studios with producer [[Doug Piercy]] to record demos of songs that would later appear on their debut album. The band was signed to New York-based Torrid Records and Exodus prepared to enter [[Prairie Sun Recording Studios]] that summer.\n\n===''Bonded By Blood'' and rise in popularity (1984\u20131991)===\n[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 30.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Steve Souza|Steve \"Zetro\" Souza]], who replaced [[Paul Baloff]], was a member of Exodus from 1986 to their first breakup in 1994, and again from 2002 to 2004. He rejoined the band once again in 2014.]]\nThe band recorded their first album, ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'', in the summer of 1984 with the band's manager [[Mark Whitaker (music producer)|Mark Whitaker]] producing. 1984 concert photos from Exodus shows at [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]]'s Eastern Front Metal Festival (with [[Slayer]] and [[Suicidal Tendencies]]) and [[Bay Area thrash metal#Ruthie's Inn, Berkeley|Ruthie's Inn]] (with [[Megadeth]] and Slayer) were included on the album sleeve inserts. Originally titled ''A Lesson in Violence'', the album was not released until April 1985 amidst creative and business setbacks. Whilst ''Bonded By Blood'' is considered a highly influential [[thrash metal]] album today, critics have regarded the delay in its release as having hindered the impact the album could have had. As Allmusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia would later write in his review for the album: \"Had it been released immediately after it was recorded in 1984, Exodus' ''Bonded by Blood'' might be regarded today alongside [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' as one of the landmark albums responsible for launching the thrash metal wave.\"<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|author=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bonded-by-blood-mw0000192933 |title=Bonded by Blood \u2013 Exodus &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref> Exodus promoted the album by going on tour with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Slayer]]. Four songs from their performance of April 5, 1985 at Studio 54 in New York City were filmed and released on home video as ''Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge''. The band subsequently toured or played selected shows with bands like [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Nuclear Assault]] and [[Hirax]].\n\nShortly after touring for ''Bonded by Blood'' was complete, Paul Baloff was fired from the band allegedly due to his behavior related to alcohol and substance abuse, and was replaced by [[Steve Souza|Steve \"Zetro\" Souza]], who had previously been the lead vocalist for Legacy, an early incarnation of fellow Bay Area thrashers [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. Baloff went on to form the band Piranha in 1987.\n\nExodus' line-up remained stable for the recording of their next two albums, and the underground success attained with ''Bonded by Blood'' would lead to the group's signing to [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[Combat Records]], who released the band's second effort ''[[Pleasures of the Flesh]]'' in 1987. The album was engineered by then-unknown [[Sylvia Massy]], who would go on to produce two releases by progressive metal band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. In support of ''Pleasures of the Flesh'', Exodus toured with the likes of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[M.O.D.]], [[L\u0227\u0227z Rockit]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].\n\n''[[Fabulous Disaster]]'', the group's third full-length album, was released in 1989. A [[music video]] for the song \"[[The Toxic Waltz (song)|The Toxic Waltz]]\" would receive consistent rotation on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |title=The History of American Thrash |publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver.com]] |accessdate=September 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083043/http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |archivedate=November 25, 2010}}</ref> While promoting ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus embarked on the [[Headbangers Ball Tour|Headbangers Ball]] tour with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Helloween]], which brought the band to a wider audience.\n\nAfter the success of ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1989, who released the band's fourth album ''[[Impact is Imminent]]'' the following year. Prior to recording the album, Tom Hunting left the band for personal reasons; he was replaced by [[John Tempesta]] on drums. In 1991, the band released their first live album, ''[[Good Friendly Violent Fun]]'', which was recorded during their 1989 tour.\n\n===''Force of Habit'', hiatus, and temporary reunion (1991\u20132000)===\n[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 33.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jack Gibson joined Exodus in 1997 as bass guitarist and has been with the group ever since.]]\n\nAfter the release of ''Good Friendly Violent Fun'', the band toured sporadically for a year. Bass guitarist McKillop was replaced by Michael Butler before the group recorded and released their next studio album titled ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992. This album was something of a departure from the band's signature sound, containing several slower, \"heavier\" songs with less emphasis on the thrash aspect of their older material. The 11-minute song \"Architect of Pain\" is a good example of the change of direction, having a much slower, grinding feel than the usual high tempo thrash they had become known for. After touring for ''Force of Habit'' was completed, behind-the-scenes issues as well as a changing musical environment prompted the band to split up.\n\nHolt and Hunting formed the groove / thrash metal outfit Wardance in the mid 90's playing several shows around the Bay Area and recording a 4-song demo, but the group never gained momentum and eventually disbanded.\n\nHolt and Hunting reunited with Paul Baloff and Rick Hunolt for a short Exodus tour in 1997. The lineup was completed with Wardance bassist Jack Gibson. They released a live album titled ''[[Another Lesson in Violence]]'' recorded at the [[Trocadero Transfer]] in front of a home town audience. However, the group disbanded again the following year, in part due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way promotion for the live album was handled, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.\n\n===Second reformation, death of Paul Baloff and ''Tempo of the Damned'' (2001\u20132004)===\nIn 2001, Exodus reformed once again with the 1997 lineup, initially to play the [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]] and [[Chuck Schuldiner]] benefit [[Thrash of the Titans]] concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play shows in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHowever, on February 2, 2002, Paul Baloff died after suffering a stroke. Former vocalist Steve Souza was brought back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments. Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio album. The result was 2004's ''[[Tempo of the Damned]]'' released on [[Nuclear Blast Records]]. An oddity of the recording sessions was that one track, \"Crime of the Century\", was dropped under mysterious circumstances. The song chronicled Exodus's time under Century Media (of which Nuclear Blast is a subsidiary). Although it was publicly denied, rumors swirled that Century Media forced the song off the record. \"Crime of the Century\" was replaced with \"Impaler\", a song which was written when Kirk Hammett was still in the band, and was previously featured on the ''Another Lesson in Violence'' live record.\n\n===Feud with Steve Souza, new members and ''Shovel Headed Kill Machine'' (2004\u20132006)===\n[[File:Rob Dukes, Exodus 5.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Rob Dukes]] was one of three new members to join Exodus in 2005.

The revamped line up released the album ''[[Shovel Headed Kill Machine]]'' in 2005. The tour for the album led to extensive travel of the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as their first-ever visit to Australia.\n\n===Reunion with Tom Hunting and the ''Exhibit'' albums (2007\u20132013)===\nTom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007 in time to record and release their 8th studio album ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A]]''. They performed at the [[Wacken Open Air]] Festival in the summer of 2008. In April 2009, Exodus embarked on a co-headlining North American tour with [[Kreator]] and also featuring [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]], [[Warbringer]], and Epicurean. Exodus then went on tour supporting [[Arch Enemy]] along with [[Arsis]] and [[Mutiny Within]].\n\nExodus provided the voices of the customers at the Duncan Hills Coffee Shop and five of the sick people in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.\n\nExodus released a re-recording of their 1985 debut album ''Bonded by Blood'' entitled ''[[Let There Be Blood]]'' in 2008. Gary Holt released the following statement about the band's decision to revisit their debut album: \"After many years in the planning and discussion stage, we have finally completed the re-recording of 'Bonded By Blood'. We have decided to call it 'Let There Be Blood' and it is our way of paying homage to [late singer] Paul Baloff by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are. We aren't trying to replace the original; that's impossible anyway. We are just giving these songs the benefit of modern production. It's something we talked about before Paul's death and it's always been important to us to do. We were super excited about entering the studio once again to record these classics, and now it's back to writing the next studio record!\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe album ''[[Exhibit B: The Human Condition]]'' was recorded in northern California with British producer Andy Sneap ([[Megadeth]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Kreator]]) and released on Nuclear Blast Records in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134987 |title=Exodus: New Album Pushed Back To May - Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063706/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134987 |archivedate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> It was announced in January 2010 that Exodus was to be on [[Megadeth]]'s ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' 20th Anniversary tour along with [[Testament (band)|Testament]].

The [[Brampton Battalion]] and the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] were added as expansion teams. The league realigned from three divisions into two conferences and four divisions. Brampton were placed in the Midwest division of the Western conference, and Mississauga were placed in the Central division of the Eastern conference. The OHL inaugurated four new trophies this season. The [[Holody Trophy]] was created for the regular season champion of the Midwest division. Two conference playoffs champions were created; the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] for the Eastern conference, and the [[Wayne Gretzky Trophy]] for the Western conference. The fourth new trophy was the [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], to be awarded to the MVP of the playoffs. Twenty teams each played sixty-eight games. The [[Belleville Bulls]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[London Knights]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Brampton Battalion===\nOn December 3, 1996, the [[Brampton Battalion]] was granted an expansion franchise owned by [[Scott Abbott]]. The team began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion's arena was the newly constructed [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]].\n\nBrampton played in their first game on September 24, 1998, losing 5-1 to the [[Peterborough Petes]] on the road. Their first home game was on October 9, as the Battalion dropped a 5-1 decision to the [[Kitchener Rangers]] in front of a sold out crowd of 4,800 at the [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]]. After beginning the season with six losses, Brampton won their first game, defeating the [[Sudbury Wolves]] 5-4 on October 18.\n\n===Mississauga IceDogs===\nOn January 21, 1997, the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] was granted an expansion franchise which included former [[Boston Bruins]] head coach [[Don Cherry]] in their ownership group.

In their home opener on October 30, Mississauga recorded their first win in franchise history, defeating the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] 4-3 in front of a sold out of 6,000 fans at the [[Hershey Centre]].\n\n==Realignment==\nWith the [[Brampton Battalion]] and [[Mississauga IceDogs]] joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1998-99 season, the league underwent a massive realignment in which two new conferences, the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, were created. Within each conference was two five-team divisions.

The [[Brampton Battalion]] and the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] were added as expansion teams. The league realigned from three divisions into two conferences and four divisions. Brampton were placed in the Midwest division of the Western conference, and Mississauga were placed in the Central division of the Eastern conference. The OHL inaugurated four new trophies this season. The [[Holody Trophy]] was created for the regular season champion of the Midwest division. Two conference playoffs champions were created; the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] for the Eastern conference, and the [[Wayne Gretzky Trophy]] for the Western conference. The fourth new trophy was the [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], to be awarded to the MVP of the playoffs. Twenty teams each played sixty-eight games. The [[Belleville Bulls]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[London Knights]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Brampton Battalion===\nOn December 3, 1996, the [[Brampton Battalion]] was granted an expansion franchise owned by [[Scott Abbott]]. The team began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion's arena was the newly constructed [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]].\n\nBrampton played in their first game on September 24, 1998, losing 5-1 to the [[Peterborough Petes]] on the road. Their first home game was on October 9, as the Battalion dropped a 5-1 decision to the [[Kitchener Rangers]] in front of a sold out crowd of 4,800 at the [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]]. After beginning the season with six losses, Brampton won their first game, defeating the [[Sudbury Wolves]] 5-4 on October 18.\n\n===Mississauga IceDogs===\nOn January 21, 1997, the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] was granted an expansion franchise which included former [[Boston Bruins]] head coach [[Don Cherry]] in their ownership group. The IceDogs began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The IceDogs arena was the newly constructed [[Hershey Centre]].\n\nThe IceDogs played in their first game on September 25, 1998, losing a road game to the [[Kingston Frontenacs]] by a score of 10-0. Mississauga began the season with an 11 game road trip, as the club lost each game. In their home opener on October 30, Mississauga recorded their first win in franchise history, defeating the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] 4-3 in front of a sold out of 6,000 fans at the [[Hershey Centre]].\n\n==Realignment==\nWith the [[Brampton Battalion]] and [[Mississauga IceDogs]] joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1998-99 season, the league underwent a massive realignment in which two new conferences, the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, were created. Within each conference was two five-team divisions. The playoff format changed that the top eight teams in each conference made the post-season.\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====East Division====\nThe East Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[Belleville Bulls]], [[Kingston Frontenacs]], [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Ottawa 67's]], and [[Peterborough Petes]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] left the division, joining the Central Division.\n\n====Central Division====\nThe Central Division underwent some major changes following the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] division. The [[Barrie Colts]], [[North Bay Centennials]] and [[Sudbury Wolves]] remained in the division, however, the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]], and [[Owen Sound Platers]] all left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division in the Western Conference. Joining the Central were the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] from the East Division, and the expansion [[Mississauga IceDogs]].\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Midwest Division====\nThe Midwest Division was a newly created division in the Western Conference. Joining the division were the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]] and [[Owen Sound Platers]] from the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] joined from the West Division. The expanion [[Brampton Battalion]] also joined the division.\n\n====West Division====\nThe West Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[London Knights]], [[Plymouth Whalers]], [[Sarnia Sting]], [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] and [[Windsor Spitfires]].

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.\" The university's first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name=\"Columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university.

[[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|title=\"The Original FM\": The Columbia University Radio Club|publisher=Columbia University|year=2009|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.\" The university's first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name=\"Columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university.

[[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|title=\"The Original FM\": The Columbia University Radio Club|publisher=Columbia University|year=2009|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].

Finch''' (February 16, 1951 \u2013 April 2, 2011<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/apr/02/memphis-basketball-legend-larry-finch-dies-age-60/ \"Memphis basketball legend Larry Finch dies at age 60\"]</ref>) was a player and coach for the [[University of Memphis]] men's [[basketball]] team.  He is perhaps most famous for leading the [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis Tigers]] to the NCAA men's basketball championship game in 1973 in a heroic loss to the [[UCLA Bruins]], led by [[Bill Walton]].\n\n== Playing career ==\n\nFinch was born in Memphis, and played basketball for [[Melrose High School (Memphis, Tennessee)|Melrose High School]] in the [[Orange Mound]] section of Memphis. He then entered Memphis State and played basketball under famed basketball coach [[Gene Bartow]]. This decision was somewhat controversial for both Memphis' black and white communities, given the recent assassination of [[Martin Luther King]] and the resultant heightened strain on race relations in Memphis, not to mention so few local African-American prep stars had been able to wear a Tiger uniform to that point. Some had advised Finch not to go, but whether or not he saw it as an opportunity to do something even more meaningful than playing for his local university, Finch loved his hometown team. As he led the Tigers to new heights of success, at least during basketball games, Memphians had a chance to see things less in black and white and more in Tiger blue and gray.\n\nIn his senior year at [[Memphis State]], 1972\u201373, he and [[Larry Kenon]] led the basketball team to the [[Final Four]]. In the championship game, Finch scored 29 points, but lost to [[John Wooden]]'s UCLA Bruins, a game where [[Bill Walton]] went 21 of 22 from the floor. Finch graduated the all-time leading scorer in Memphis history, and is currently the second all-time leading scorer for the [[University of Memphis]].\n\nFinch was [[NBA Draft|drafted]] on the fourth round by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] [[1973 NBA draft|in 1973]], but opted to join the local [[American Basketball Association]] team, the [[Memphis Tams]]. Finch played professionally for two years with the Tams, the [[Memphis Sounds]] and the [[Baltimore Hustlers]] and [[Baltimore Claws]].\n\n== Coaching career ==\n\nIn the 1980s, Finch was an assistant coach for [[Dana Kirk (coach)|Dana Kirk]] at Memphis State. Kirk was forced to leave Memphis State after violating NCAA regulations and becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, and while asking for and getting immunity from prosecution in the Kirk trial,  Finch was made head coach in 1986. He would remain at the school, which was renamed the University of Memphis in 1994, until 1997.\n\nFinch posted 10 out of 11 winning seasons, seven 20+ win seasons, and six NCAA tournaments. He recruited and developed such players as [[Elliot Perry]], [[Penny Hardaway]], and [[Lorenzen Wright]]. His 1991\u201392 team led by Hardaway and [[David Vaughn III|David Vaughn]] went to the [[Elite Eight]] of the NCAA tournament. During his tenure, the basketball players began to graduate in high numbers.\n\nAs a player, Finch was known for his shooting prowess, and his skills remained intact throughout his coaching days; he would routinely win games of [[H-O-R-S-E]] against his players and against assistant coaches in long distance shooting contests after road game practices. Even while head coach, he maintained connections to his roots; he often visited Orange Mound barbershops, often delivering Memphis State posters and other team paraphernalia.\n\nDespite Finch's overall success, during the mid-1990s more and more local blue chip recruits began leaving for other schools, specifically [[Todd Day]] to the [[University of Arkansas]] and others to the [[University of Tennessee]]. This began grating on Tiger fans, who had become used to seeing national powers built on primarily Memphis-area talent. While there was the Elite Eight team of 91\u201392, several of Finch's teams were considered under-achievers, such as the highly touted 1995\u201396 squad which lost to 12th seeded [[Drexel University]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nFinch was forced to resign and his contract was bought out at the end of the 1996\u201397 season. The forced resignation was a public relations fiasco for the university and athletic director [[R. C. Johnson]], as the deal was finalized immediately following Finch's final game in one of the concession areas of the [[Pyramid Arena]].<ref>[http://www.memphisflyer.com/backissues/issue416/sport416.htm Dead Man Walking: The University of Memphis announced the forced resignation of head coach Larry Finch amidst an uncontrollable media frenzy], by Dennis Freeland, ''[[The Memphis Flyer]]''</ref> Although a portion of the fan base had become disenchanted with Finch, even some of his detractors were critical of the way school officials handled it. He left as the school's all-time winningest coach, a record which stood until [[John Calipari]] passed him in 2007\u201308.  However, after all of the Tigers' wins in the 2007\u201308 season were vacated, Finch recovered his standing as the school's winningest coach.\n\n== After basketball ==\n\nIn 1998, he ran for the office of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] Registrar and lost to the incumbent by only 127 votes despite having no government experience. He was briefly in the running for coaching positions at [[Tennessee State]], [[Georgia State University|Georgia State]], and [[University of South Alabama|South Alabama]].\n\nIn 2002, Finch suffered a debilitating stroke. People close to Finch created the Friends of Larry Finch Foundation to help offset his medical expenses. In December 2006, the Foundation released a Larry Finch tribute CD called \"Eye of the Tiger\", featuring performers from Memphis' diverse musical community such as [[Al Green]], [[The Bar-Kays]], Gary Johns, John Kilzer, and Al Kapone.\n\nFinch died on April 2, 2011, after a long illness.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n{{CBB Yearly Record

Finch''' (February 16, 1951 \u2013 April 2, 2011<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/apr/02/memphis-basketball-legend-larry-finch-dies-age-60/ \"Memphis basketball legend Larry Finch dies at age 60\"]</ref>) was a player and coach for the [[University of Memphis]] men's [[basketball]] team.  He is perhaps most famous for leading the [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis Tigers]] to the NCAA men's basketball championship game in 1973 in a heroic loss to the [[UCLA Bruins]], led by [[Bill Walton]].\n\n== Playing career ==\n\nFinch was born in Memphis, and played basketball for [[Melrose High School (Memphis, Tennessee)|Melrose High School]] in the [[Orange Mound]] section of Memphis. He then entered Memphis State and played basketball under famed basketball coach [[Gene Bartow]]. This decision was somewhat controversial for both Memphis' black and white communities, given the recent assassination of [[Martin Luther King]] and the resultant heightened strain on race relations in Memphis, not to mention so few local African-American prep stars had been able to wear a Tiger uniform to that point. Some had advised Finch not to go, but whether or not he saw it as an opportunity to do something even more meaningful than playing for his local university, Finch loved his hometown team. As he led the Tigers to new heights of success, at least during basketball games, Memphians had a chance to see things less in black and white and more in Tiger blue and gray.\n\nIn his senior year at [[Memphis State]], 1972\u201373, he and [[Larry Kenon]] led the basketball team to the [[Final Four]]. In the championship game, Finch scored 29 points, but lost to [[John Wooden]]'s UCLA Bruins, a game where [[Bill Walton]] went 21 of 22 from the floor. Finch graduated the all-time leading scorer in Memphis history, and is currently the second all-time leading scorer for the [[University of Memphis]].\n\nFinch was [[NBA Draft|drafted]] on the fourth round by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] [[1973 NBA draft|in 1973]], but opted to join the local [[American Basketball Association]] team, the [[Memphis Tams]]. Finch played professionally for two years with the Tams, the [[Memphis Sounds]] and the [[Baltimore Hustlers]] and [[Baltimore Claws]].\n\n== Coaching career ==\n\nIn the 1980s, Finch was an assistant coach for [[Dana Kirk (coach)|Dana Kirk]] at Memphis State. Kirk was forced to leave Memphis State after violating NCAA regulations and becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, and while asking for and getting immunity from prosecution in the Kirk trial,  Finch was made head coach in 1986. He would remain at the school, which was renamed the University of Memphis in 1994, until 1997.\n\nFinch posted 10 out of 11 winning seasons, seven 20+ win seasons, and six NCAA tournaments. He recruited and developed such players as [[Elliot Perry]], [[Penny Hardaway]], and [[Lorenzen Wright]]. His 1991\u201392 team led by Hardaway and [[David Vaughn III|David Vaughn]] went to the [[Elite Eight]] of the NCAA tournament. During his tenure, the basketball players began to graduate in high numbers.\n\nAs a player, Finch was known for his shooting prowess, and his skills remained intact throughout his coaching days; he would routinely win games of [[H-O-R-S-E]] against his players and against assistant coaches in long distance shooting contests after road game practices. Even while head coach, he maintained connections to his roots; he often visited Orange Mound barbershops, often delivering Memphis State posters and other team paraphernalia.\n\nDespite Finch's overall success, during the mid-90's more and more local blue chip recruits began leaving for other schools, specifically [[Todd Day]] to the [[University of Arkansas]] and others to the [[University of Tennessee]]. This began grating on Tiger fans, who had become used to seeing national powers built on primarily Memphis-area talent. While there was the Elite Eight team of 91\u201392, several of Finch's teams were considered under-achievers, such as the highly touted 1995\u201396 squad which lost to 12th seeded [[Drexel University]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nFinch was forced to resign and his contract was bought out at the end of the 1996\u201397 season. The forced resignation was a public relations fiasco for the university and athletic director [[R. C. Johnson]], as the deal was finalized immediately following Finch's final game in one of the concession areas of the [[Pyramid Arena]].<ref>[http://www.memphisflyer.com/backissues/issue416/sport416.htm Dead Man Walking: The University of Memphis announced the forced resignation of head coach Larry Finch amidst an uncontrollable media frenzy], by Dennis Freeland, ''[[The Memphis Flyer]]''</ref> Although a portion of the fan base had become disenchanted with Finch, even some of his detractors were critical of the way school officials handled it. He left as the school's all-time winningest coach, a record which stood until [[John Calipari]] passed him in 2007\u201308.  However, after all of the Tigers' wins in the 2007\u201308 season were vacated, Finch recovered his standing as the school's winningest coach.\n\n== After basketball ==\n\nIn 1998, he ran for the office of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] Registrar and lost to the incumbent by only 127 votes despite having no government experience. He was briefly in the running for coaching positions at [[Tennessee State]], [[Georgia State University|Georgia State]], and [[University of South Alabama|South Alabama]].\n\nIn 2002, Finch suffered a debilitating stroke. People close to Finch created the Friends of Larry Finch Foundation to help offset his medical expenses. In December 2006, the Foundation released a Larry Finch tribute CD called \"Eye of the Tiger\", featuring performers from Memphis' diverse musical community such as [[Al Green]], [[The Bar-Kays]], Gary Johns, John Kilzer, and Al Kapone.\n\nFinch died on April 2, 2011, after a long illness.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n{{CBB Yearly Record
