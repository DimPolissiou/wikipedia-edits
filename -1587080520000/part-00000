The school's team competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The Bearcats are coached by [[John Brannen (basketball)|John Brannen]], who has been UC's head coach since 2019.\n\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46\u201332. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season).\n\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at [[Fifth Third Arena]], which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017\u201318 season at [[BB&T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] in 2005, which was rebranded as the [[American Athletic Conference]] (AAC) in 2013.\n\n==By the numbers==\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2017\u201318 season):\n* Wins: 1835 (14th)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cincinnati/|title=Cincinnati|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n* Win percentage: .641 (23th)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* National Titles: 2 (T-9th)<ref>[[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions]]</ref>\n* Final Fours: 6 (T-10th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament appearances: 33 (T-13th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Tournament bids by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament games played: 77 (16th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\"/>\n* NCAA Tournament wins: 46 (17th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\">[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament all-time team records]]</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 25: 434 (12th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=totapp&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 10: 210 (15th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll: 45 (7th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1992\u20132005 (T-11th longest streak all-time)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 2011\u2013present (T-5th longest active streak)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* First-team Consensus All-American selections: 8 (T-22nd)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2012/Awards.pdf|title=All-American Award Winners|author=|date=|work=ncaa.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Current players in the NBA: 2 (T-26th)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-10-16/colleges-most-players-nba-opening-day-rosters|title=Where the NBA Players Come From|first=Jim|last=Sukup|date=|work=ncaa.com|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}</ref>\n* First school to reach three consecutive National Title games (1961\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/datadump/sports/mbball/history/history.html|title=UCBearcats \u2013 Official Athletic Website of the University of Cincinnati|author=|date=|work=gobearcats.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* First school to reach five consecutive Final Fours (1959\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===1901-1940s \u2013 The beginning===\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to [[Yale]] but later defeated a team from the [[University of Kentucky]] while compiling a 5\u20134 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]] and the [[Mid-American Conference]].\n\n===1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special===\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], with a 97\u201365 win over [[Indiana]] in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was [[Jack Twyman]], who earned [[All-America]] status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n[[Oscar Robertson]] made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to [[Kansas State]] in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n===1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other===\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach ([[Ed Jucker]]) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when Loyola (Ill.) overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\n\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. [[Connie Dierking]] (1958), [[Ralph Davis (basketball)|Ralph Davis]] (1960), [[Bob Wiesenhahn]] (1961), [[Paul Hogue]] (1961, 1962), [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] (1963), [[Tony Yates]] (1963), [[Ron Bonham]] (1963, 1964) and [[George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)|George Wilson]] (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n===1970s \u2013 Continued success===\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). Cincinnati inaugurated the [[Metro Conference]] by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974\u20131977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. [[Jim Ard]] (1970), [[Lloyd Batts]] (1973), [[Steve Collier]] (1976), [[Gary Yoder]] (1977), [[Bob Miller (basketball)|Bob Miller]] (1978) and [[Pat Cummings]] (1979) earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\n\n===1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps===\nCincinnati fell into exceptionally hard times during the 1980s, going 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade. [[Tony Yates]], a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, was hired as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After several unremarkable campaigns thereafter, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 [[1985 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].\n\n===1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight===\n[[Bob Huggins]], the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\n\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, [[Danny Fortson]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Steve Logan]], picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Ruben Patterson]], Bobby Brannen, [[Melvin Levett]], Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\n\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president [[Nancy Zimpher]] in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for [[driving under the influence|DUI]] in 2004.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114367599328911693?mod=todays_us_personal_journal | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Skip | last=Rozin | title=The Basketball Coach Vs. the College President | date=March 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"wlwt.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172318/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2141189|title=Text of letter sent to Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins|date=23 August 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n===2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program===\nIn the spring of 2006, [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]] was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] after the dismissal of [[Bob Huggins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2382844|title=Cronin introduced as head coach at Cincinnati|author=|date=March 24, 2006|work=espn.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker [[Connor Barwin]].\n\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n===2010\u2013present \u2013 Return to winning ways===\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances|consecutive NCAA Tournaments]], along with [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17th against [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]].<ref>https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/01/05/cincinnati-mick-cronin-health</ref> Assistant Coach, [[Larry Davis (basketball)|Larry Davis]] took the reigns and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn 2013\u201314 season and 2017\u201318 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u20132019 seasons Cincinnati won the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]]. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as [[Sean Kilpatrick]], [[Troy Caupain]], [[Jacob Evans]], and [[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]]. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and [[Jarron Cumberland]].\n\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] after UCLA had fired Coach [[Steve Alford]] earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the [[2018\u201319 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Bearcats]]). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that [[John Brannen (basketball)| John Brannen]] was being hired as the new head coach.\n\n==Notable seasons==\n* '''1959\u201360''' [[Oscar Robertson]] scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. [[North Texas State]] and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. [[California]] again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n* '''1960\u201361''' Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, [[Ed Jucker]], in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated [[Ohio State]] in overtime, 70\u201365.\n* '''1961\u201362''' Cincinnati fashioned a 28\u20132 record, but the Bearcats had to defeat [[Bradley]] in a league playoff game to defend their national title. UC won the Midwest Regional to earn its fourth straight trip to the Final Four. After edging [[UCLA]], 72\u201370, in the semifinals, Cincinnati became a repeat champion with a 71\u201359 win over Ohio State. [[Paul Hogue]] was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n* '''1962\u201363''' UC breezed to its fifth straight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] crown and, after winning the Midwest Regional, a fifth straight trip to the Final Four. An 80\u201346 win over [[Oregon]] in the semifinals put the Bearcats in position to win a third straight national title. Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n* '''1991\u201392''' The Bearcats opened play in the [[Great Midwest Conference]] and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional. UC defeated its four regional foes by an average margin of 20.8 points to make its sixth appearance in the Final Four. Michigan's [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|\"Fab Five\"]] edged UC, 76\u201372, in the semifinal.\n* '''1999\u201300''' Cincinnati was the nation's top team and [[Kenyon Martin]] was college basketball's top player. UC was ranked No. 1 in the national polls for 12 of 18 weeks and Martin made a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards (Naismith, Wooden, Rupp, Robertson, NABC). The Bearcats tied a school record for victories with a 29\u20134 record and won their fifth straight [[Conference USA]] regular season title. UC seemed poised for a run for the national title until Martin suffered a broken leg in the [[Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament|Conference USA Tournament]]. Martin was a unanimous first team [[All-American]] with Pete Mickeal earning honorable mention honors. Cincinnati went from the #1 team in the country to a 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament, and fell to [[Tulsa]] in the 2nd round.\n* '''2001\u201302''' Unranked in the major polls at the start of the season, the Bearcats posted a 31\u20134 record\u2014setting a new standard for victories\u2014won a seventh consecutive Conference USA regular season championship, captured the C-USA tournament crown and earned their first-ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. [[Steve Logan]] earned his second straight Conference USA Player of the Year award, was a consensus All-American and a finalist for every national player of the year honor. The Bearcats were upset in the 2nd round to 8-seed UCLA in a double-overtime thriller.\n* '''2011\u201312''' After starting the season 5\u20133 with bad losses and dealing with the aftermath and suspensions from the [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|Crosstown Shootout brawl]], UC's season was already on the brinks halfway through December. The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 [[2011\u201312 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]] in the [[2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State. The latter half of this season is considered by many to be a big turning point in [[Mick Cronin (basketball coach)|Mick Cronin]]'s coaching career. \n* '''2017\u201318''' Cincinnati began the season with high hopes, featuring a team hallmarked by four \"1000 point career scorers\" ([[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]], [[Jacob Evans]], Kyle Washington, and [[Cane Broome]]). They spent the entire season in the national polls, peaking at #5 - this was fueled by their defensive prowess which ranked second overall nationally. They earned their first outright American Athletic Conference regular season and tournament championships and tied the school record for wins, going 31\u20135. Their season ended with a second round NCAA tournament upset to Nevada who tied the record for the 2nd largest NCAA Tournament comeback- surmounting a 22-point deficit to win by 2.\n\n==Notable games==\n'''01/09/1958 \u2013 Cincinnati 118, Seton Hall 54''': 19-year-old sophomore [[Oscar Robertson]] (\"The Big O\") dropped 56 points, scoring more than all of Seton Hall, and caught the attention of New York City in a road win. His 56 points, at the time, was a [[Madison Square Garden]] record.\n\n'''03/25/1961 \u2013 Cincinnati 70, Ohio State 65''': The Buckeyes were the defending champs, 27\u20130 and No. 1 in the nation. They took on state rival No. 2 Cincinnati in the National Championship. A layup by Ohio State's [[Bobby Knight]] sent the game into overtime, tied at 61.

The arena is on-campus and has a capacity of 12,012 (with room for overflow). It is located in the Myrl H. Shoemaker Center, which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was named for Cincinnati-based [[Fifth Third Bank]]. It is still popularly known as \"The Shoe\". The Bearcats closed out Fifth Third Arena (pre-2018 renovation) with an all-time home record of 389\u201379 ({{Winning percentage|389|79}}), along with an active 26-game home winning streak. The Bearcats held a 42-game win streak from 1997\u20132000 as well. In the 1999\u20132000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also will feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites.

[[University of Cincinnati]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. The school's team competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The Bearcats are coached by [[John Brannen (basketball)|John Brannen]], who has been UC's head coach since 2019.\n\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46\u201332. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season).\n\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at [[Fifth Third Arena]], which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017\u201318 season at [[BB&T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] in 2005, which was rebranded as the [[American Athletic Conference]] (AAC) in 2013.\n\n==By the numbers==\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2017\u201318 season):\n* Wins: 1835 (14th)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cincinnati/|title=Cincinnati|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n* Win percentage: .641 (23th)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* National Titles: 2 (T-9th)<ref>[[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions]]</ref>\n* Final Fours: 6 (T-10th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament appearances: 33 (T-13th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Tournament bids by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament games played: 77 (16th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\"/>\n* NCAA Tournament wins: 46 (17th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\">[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament all-time team records]]</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 25: 434 (12th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=totapp&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 10: 210 (15th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll: 45 (7th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1992\u20132005 (T-11th longest streak all-time)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 2011\u2013present (T-5th longest active streak)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* First-team Consensus All-American selections: 8 (T-22nd)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2012/Awards.pdf|title=All-American Award Winners|author=|date=|work=ncaa.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Current players in the NBA: 2 (T-26th)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-10-16/colleges-most-players-nba-opening-day-rosters|title=Where the NBA Players Come From|first=Jim|last=Sukup|date=|work=ncaa.com|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}</ref>\n* First school to reach three consecutive National Title games (1961\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/datadump/sports/mbball/history/history.html|title=UCBearcats \u2013 Official Athletic Website of the University of Cincinnati|author=|date=|work=gobearcats.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* First school to reach five consecutive Final Fours (1959\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===1901-1940s \u2013 The beginning===\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to [[Yale]] but later defeated a team from the [[University of Kentucky]] while compiling a 5\u20134 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]] and the [[Mid-American Conference]].\n\n===1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special===\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], with a 97\u201365 win over [[Indiana]] in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was [[Jack Twyman]], who earned [[All-America]] status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n[[Oscar Robertson]] made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to [[Kansas State]] in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n===1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other===\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach ([[Ed Jucker]]) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when Loyola (Ill.) overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\n\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. [[Connie Dierking]] (1958), [[Ralph Davis (basketball)|Ralph Davis]] (1960), [[Bob Wiesenhahn]] (1961), [[Paul Hogue]] (1961, 1962), [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] (1963), [[Tony Yates]] (1963), [[Ron Bonham]] (1963, 1964) and [[George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)|George Wilson]] (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n===1970s \u2013 Continued success===\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). Cincinnati inaugurated the [[Metro Conference]] by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974\u20131977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. [[Jim Ard]] (1970), [[Lloyd Batts]] (1973), [[Steve Collier]] (1976), [[Gary Yoder]] (1977), [[Bob Miller (basketball)|Bob Miller]] (1978) and [[Pat Cummings]] (1979) earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\n\n===1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps===\nCincinnati fell into exceptionally hard times during the 1980s, going 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade. [[Tony Yates]], a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, was hired as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After several unremarkable campaigns thereafter, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 [[1985 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].\n\n===1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight===\n[[Bob Huggins]], the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\n\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, [[Danny Fortson]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Steve Logan]], picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Ruben Patterson]], Bobby Brannen, [[Melvin Levett]], Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\n\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president [[Nancy Zimpher]] in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for [[driving under the influence|DUI]] in 2004.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114367599328911693?mod=todays_us_personal_journal | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Skip | last=Rozin | title=The Basketball Coach Vs. the College President | date=March 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"wlwt.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172318/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2141189|title=Text of letter sent to Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins|date=23 August 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n===2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program===\nIn the spring of 2006, [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]] was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] after the dismissal of [[Bob Huggins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2382844|title=Cronin introduced as head coach at Cincinnati|author=|date=March 24, 2006|work=espn.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker [[Connor Barwin]].\n\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n===2010\u2013present \u2013 Return to winning ways===\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances|consecutive NCAA Tournaments]], along with [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17th against [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]].<ref>https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/01/05/cincinnati-mick-cronin-health</ref> Assistant Coach, [[Larry Davis (basketball)|Larry Davis]] took the reigns and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn 2013\u201314 season and 2017\u201318 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u20132019 seasons Cincinnati won the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]]. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as [[Sean Kilpatrick]], [[Troy Caupain]], [[Jacob Evans]], and [[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]]. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and [[Jarron Cumberland]].\n\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] after UCLA had fired Coach [[Steve Alford]] earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the [[2018\u201319 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Bearcats]]). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that [[John Brannen (basketball)| John Brannen]] was being hired as the new head coach.\n\n==Notable seasons==\n* '''1959\u201360''' [[Oscar Robertson]] scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. [[North Texas State]] and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. [[California]] again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n* '''1960\u201361''' Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, [[Ed Jucker]], in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated [[Ohio State]] in overtime, 70\u201365.\n* '''1961\u201362''' Cincinnati fashioned a 28\u20132 record, but the Bearcats had to defeat [[Bradley]] in a league playoff game to defend their national title. UC won the Midwest Regional to earn its fourth straight trip to the Final Four. After edging [[UCLA]], 72\u201370, in the semifinals, Cincinnati became a repeat champion with a 71\u201359 win over Ohio State. [[Paul Hogue]] was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n* '''1962\u201363''' UC breezed to its fifth straight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] crown and, after winning the Midwest Regional, a fifth straight trip to the Final Four. An 80\u201346 win over [[Oregon]] in the semifinals put the Bearcats in position to win a third straight national title. Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n* '''1991\u201392''' The Bearcats opened play in the [[Great Midwest Conference]] and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional. UC defeated its four regional foes by an average margin of 20.8 points to make its sixth appearance in the Final Four. Michigan's [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|\"Fab Five\"]] edged UC, 76\u201372, in the semifinal.\n* '''1999\u201300''' Cincinnati was the nation's top team and [[Kenyon Martin]] was college basketball's top player. UC was ranked No. 1 in the national polls for 12 of 18 weeks and Martin made a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards (Naismith, Wooden, Rupp, Robertson, NABC). The Bearcats tied a school record for victories with a 29\u20134 record and won their fifth straight [[Conference USA]] regular season title. UC seemed poised for a run for the national title until Martin suffered a broken leg in the [[Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament|Conference USA Tournament]].

The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 [[2011\u201312 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]] in the [[2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State. The latter half of this season is considered by many to be a big turning point in [[Mick Cronin (basketball coach)|Mick Cronin]]'s coaching career. \n* '''2017\u201318''' Cincinnati began the season with high hopes, featuring a team hallmarked by four \"1000 point career scorers\" ([[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]], [[Jacob Evans]], Kyle Washington, and [[Cane Broome]]).

During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also will feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites.  During the meeting, trustee Rob Richardson Jr. said the upgraded facility would support the university's objective to join a power athletic conference and in student-athlete recruitment.
