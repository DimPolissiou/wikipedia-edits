[[Stage-to-film adaptation|Based on his stage show]] of the same name, it follows Guillaume as a boy as he develops his own [[Self-concept|identity]] and his relationship with his mother.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in France on 20 November 2013. In January 2014, the film was nominated for ten [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s and won five, including awards for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best First Feature Film|Best First Feature Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a theatre, Guillaume recounts how his life developed as a youth. As a young [[effeminate]] boy, his mother casually dismisses his antics. When he asks to go learn Spanish, his mother sends him to [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]]. There he stays with Paqui, a Spanish woman unable to speak French. As they awkwardly try to communicate, she suggests teaching him how to dance the [[sevillanas]]. Becoming proficient, Guillaume dances at a local festival but is subjected to laughter. Oblivious to why, he asks a woman named Pilar to dance with him. She politely refuses, explaining to him how he dances like a girl. He asks her if she thinks he looks like a girl. She agrees and he happily remarks that his mother would be delighted.\n\nFascinated by his mother, Guillaume imitates her voice to the family cook and his grandmother, Babou. His father, however, is dissatisfied with his son's behaviour. After catching him pretending to be [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Sissi]], his father sends him away to an all-boys boarding school. Unable to withstand the constant taunting, Guillaume writes a plea to his father. Following a psychiatric assessment, his parents decide to transfer him to an English boarding school.\n\nGuillaume revels in his new school, a place where he is no longer judged by his personality. He develops an attraction to a schoolboy named Jeremy, but is heartbroken when he discovers Jeremy having sex with a girl. While his mother tries to console him, she inadvertently blurts out that he is [[homosexual]]; a thought that did not initially occur to him. He gains exemption from his [[national service]] because of his fragile state.\n\nAfter a series of psychotherapy sessions, Guillaume decides to visit a Bavarian spa to relax. There he is given a painful [[sports massage]] by Raymund and an unexpected [[colonic]] by Ingeborg. Still conflicted about his sexuality, he is advised by his aunt to experiment. During his first attempt, he introduces himself to a man named Karim at a nightclub and follows him home. At Karim's flat, he finds two other men waiting to [[gang bang]] him. He escapes after Karim realises that he is not an Arab. In his second attempt, he meets a well-endowed man and panics.\n\nEventually, Guillaume meets a woman named Amandine at a friend's dinner party. He falls in love and they get engaged. When broaching the subject to his mother, she begins to question his sexuality.

Since the late 20th century the New South has emerged as the fastest growing area of the United States economically. Multiculturalism has become mainstream in the Southeastern states. [[African Americans]] remain a dominant demographic at around a 30% of the total population of the Southeast. The New South is built upon the metropolitan areas along the interstate 85 corridor. Cities include Birmingham, Atlanta, Greenville, Spartanburg, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Raleigh-Durham.\n\n===Climate===\nMost of the southeastern part of the United States is dominated by the [[humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa/Cwa). As one nears the southern portions of [[Florida]], the climate gradually becomes [[tropical]] as winters are freeze free and all months have a mean temperature above {{convert|64.4|F|C}} (the defined coldest monthly mean temperature of tropical climates).\n\nSeasonally, summers are generally hot and humid throughout the entire region. The [[Bermuda High]] pumps hot and moist air mass from the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] and eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]] westward toward the southeast United States, creating the typical sultry tropical summers. Daytime highs are often in the upper 80's to lower 90's F.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=20227&cityname=Miami-Florida-United-States-of-America&units=us| title=Miami, Florida Temperature Averages| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=570327&cityname=Virginia-Beach-Virginia-United-States-of-America&units=us| title=Virginia Beach, Virginia Temperature Averages| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> Rainfall is summer concentrated along the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic coast from [[Norfolk, VA]] southward, reaching a sharp summer [[monsoon]] like pattern over peninsular Florida, with dry winters and wet summers. Sunshine is abundant across the southeastern United States in summer, as the rainfall often comes in quick, but intense downpours. The mid-South, especially Tennessee, and the northern halves of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, have maximum monthly rainfall amounts in winter and spring, owing to copious Gulf moisture and clashes between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada during the cold season. Here, December, March or April are typically the wettest months; August to October, the driest months (for example, at [[Tupelo, MS]], [[Huntsville, AL]] and [[Memphis, TN]]).\n\nWinters are cool in the northern areas like Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and western North Carolina, with average highs in the {{convert|45|F|C}} range in January. Farther south, winters become more mild across interior eastern North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, with average January highs in the {{convert|53|F|C}} range. As one nears the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain and coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas, winters become warm, with daytime highs near or over {{convert|60|F|C}}, until far enough south in central Florida where daytime highs are above {{convert|70|F|C}}. Winters tend to be very dry and sunny across Florida, with a gradual increase in winter rainfall with increasing latitude, especially west of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\n==Economy==\n{{example farm|section|date=March 2014}}\nThe Southeast has changed dramatically in the last two generations. Since 1980, there has been a [[Economic boom|boom]] in its [[service economy]], manufacturing base, high technology industries, and the financial sector. Examples of this include the surge in [[tourism]] in Florida and along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]; numerous new automobile production plants such as [[Mercedes-Benz]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]; [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]; [[Toyota Motors]] in [[Blue Springs, Mississippi]]; [[Kia Motors|Kia]] in [[West Point, Georgia]]; the [[BMW]] production plant in [[Greer, South Carolina]]; [[Volkswagen]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]; the [[General Motors|GM]] manufacturing plant in [[Spring Hill, Tennessee]]; the [[Volkswagen]] manufacturing plant in [[Pulaski, Virginia]];and the [[Nissan]] North American headquarters in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]; the two largest research parks in the country: [[Research Triangle Park]] in the Triangle area of North Carolina (the world's largest) and the [[Cummings Research Park]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] (the world's fourth largest); and the corporate headquarters of [[Verso Paper]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], as well as [[FedEx]], which is one of the world's largest shipping companies.\n \nFortune 500 companies having headquarters in the region include 20 in Virginia, 16 in Florida, 15 in North Carolina, and 14 in Georgia. This economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to have of some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050819/jobless.shtml| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060052/http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050819/jobless.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date=September 28, 2007| title=State jobless rate below US average| work=The Decatur Daily| date=August 19, 2005| accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> In Alabama, there is a large-scale manufacturing project owned by the German steel megacorporation [[ThyssenKrupp]], which operates a massive, state-of-the-art facility in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].\n\n===Research and development===\n[[Research Triangle Park]], in the [[Research Triangle|Raleigh-Durham]] urban area of North Carolina, has emerged as a major hub of technology, governmental, and biotechnological research and development, as has the [[Virginia BioTechnology Research Park]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

There is no official [[Census Bureau]] definition of the southeastern United States; instead, they divide a larger region including Texas and Oklahoma designated as the \"South\" into three subregions none of which are conventionally considered to define the southeast.

The state of [[Delaware]] plus the [[District of Columbia]] are also sometimes added in some definitions of the term.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n \nThe history of human presence in the Southeastern United States extends to before the dawn of civilization about 11,000 BC. The earliest artifacts were from the [[Clovis culture]].\n \nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans of the [[Woodland period]] tradition occupied the region for several hundred years.\n \nThe first Europeans to arrive in the region were [[conquistador]]s of the [[Spanish Empire]]. In 1541, [[Hernando de Soto]] journeyed through the south and crossed the [[Mississippi River]].\n \nThe region hosted the first permanent European settlement in North America, by the [[Kingdom of England]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607.\n \nPrior to and during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865), the [[Confederate States of America]] consisted of the southeastern states plus [[Texas]], i.e., [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]], [[Tennessee]], [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Texas]].

Since the late 20th century the New South has emerged as the fastest growing area of the United States economically. Multiculturalism has become mainstream in the Southeastern states. [[African Americans]] remain a dominant demographic at around a 30% of the total population of the Southeast. The New South is built upon the metropolitan areas along the interstate 85 corridor. Cities include Birmingham, Atlanta, Greenville, Spartanburg, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Raleigh-Durham.\n\n===Climate===\nMost of the southeastern part of the United States is dominated by the [[humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa/Cwa). As one nears the southern portions of [[Florida]], the climate gradually becomes [[tropical]] as winters are freeze free and all months have a mean temperature above {{convert|64.4|F|C}} (the defined coldest monthly mean temperature of tropical climates).\n\nSeasonally, summers are generally hot and humid throughout the entire region. The [[Bermuda High]] pumps hot and moist air mass from the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] and eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]] westward toward the southeast United States, creating the typical sultry tropical summers. Daytime highs are often in the upper 80's to lower 90's F.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=20227&cityname=Miami-Florida-United-States-of-America&units=us| title=Miami, Florida Temperature Averages| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=570327&cityname=Virginia-Beach-Virginia-United-States-of-America&units=us| title=Virginia Beach, Virginia Temperature Averages| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> Rainfall is summer concentrated along the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic coast from [[Norfolk, VA]] southward, reaching a sharp summer [[monsoon]] like pattern over peninsular Florida, with dry winters and wet summers. Sunshine is abundant across the southeastern United States in summer, as the rainfall often comes in quick, but intense downpours. The mid-South, especially Tennessee, and the northern halves of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, have maximum monthly rainfall amounts in winter and spring, owing to copious Gulf moisture and clashes between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada during the cold season. Here, December, March or April are typically the wettest months; August to October, the driest months (for example, at [[Tupelo, MS]], [[Huntsville, AL]] and [[Memphis, TN]]).\n\nWinters are cool in the northern areas like Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and western North Carolina, with average highs in the {{convert|45|F|C}} range in January. Farther south, winters become more mild across interior eastern North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, with average January highs in the {{convert|53|F|C}} range. As one nears the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain and coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas, winters become warm, with daytime highs near or over {{convert|60|F|C}}, until far enough south in central Florida where daytime highs are above {{convert|70|F|C}}. Winters tend to be very dry and sunny across Florida, with a gradual increase in winter rainfall with increasing latitude, especially west of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\n==Economy==\n{{example farm|section|date=March 2014}}\nThe Southeast has changed dramatically in the last two generations. Since 1980, there has been a [[Economic boom|boom]] in its [[service economy]], manufacturing base, high technology industries, and the financial sector. Examples of this include the surge in [[tourism]] in Florida and along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]; numerous new automobile production plants such as [[Mercedes-Benz]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]; [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]; [[Toyota Motors]] in [[Blue Springs, Mississippi]]; [[Kia Motors|Kia]] in [[West Point, Georgia]]; the [[BMW]] production plant in [[Greer, South Carolina]]; [[Volkswagen]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]; the [[General Motors|GM]] manufacturing plant in [[Spring Hill, Tennessee]]; the [[Volkswagen]] manufacturing plant in [[Pulaski, Virginia]];and the [[Nissan]] North American headquarters in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]; the two largest research parks in the country: [[Research Triangle Park]] in the Triangle area of North Carolina (the world's largest) and the [[Cummings Research Park]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] (the world's fourth largest); and the corporate headquarters of [[Verso Paper]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], as well as [[FedEx]], which is one of the world's largest shipping companies.\n \nFortune 500 companies having headquarters in the region include 20 in Virginia, 16 in Florida, 15 in North Carolina, and 14 in Georgia. This economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to have of some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050819/jobless.shtml| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060052/http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050819/jobless.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date=September 28, 2007| title=State jobless rate below US average| work=The Decatur Daily| date=August 19, 2005| accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> In Alabama, there is a large-scale manufacturing project owned by the German steel megacorporation [[ThyssenKrupp]], which operates a massive, state-of-the-art facility in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].\n\n===Research and development===\n[[Research Triangle Park]], in the [[Research Triangle|Raleigh-Durham]] urban area of North Carolina, has emerged as a major hub of technology, governmental, and biotechnological research and development, as has the [[Virginia BioTechnology Research Park]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].
