It was released as the album's fourth single on May 24, 2013, for [[Music download|digital download]]. The track features American singer-songwriter [[Bruno Mars]], and rappers [[Tyga]] and [[Mystic (singer)|Mystic]]. The single version also features verses from American rapper [[2 Chainz]]. [[Diplo|Thomas Pentz]], [[Switch (house DJ)|David Taylor]], Mars, [[Tyga|Michael Stevenson]] and Mystic co-wrote the track, while production was handled by Major Lazer and [[Valentino Khan]]. Musically, it is an electronic dance, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[dancehall]] track with lyrics implying that girls twerk and show off their giant buttocks.\n\n\"Bubble Butt\" received mixed reviews from most [[music journalism|critics]]. Some complimented its engaging sound and high energy, while others criticized its lyrical content and repetitious nature. \"Bubble Butt\" found some commercial success. It was Major Lazer's first commercial single to enter the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number&nbsp;56 while reaching number eight on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. It has topped the charts in Lebanon and South Korea, and has been certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n[[Eric Wareheim]] of comedy team [[Tim & Eric]] shot the song's [[music video]]. It depicts three young women in an apartment listening to [[seapunk|seapunk music]] and taking pictures on their phones when a flying giant lands next to their apartment and inflates their buttocks. The girls start to dance with their new assets after the walls of the apartment fall off and reveal a dancefloor. Major Lazer played the song several times in their shows and in music festivals; they performed with 2 Chainz at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], at [[Rock Werchter]] in 2013, and at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in 2014. The song was included in ''[[Major Lazer Essentials]]'' (2018), their first greatest hits compilation.\n\n==Background and production==\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Diplo]] explained \"Bubble Butt\" first began taking shape while he and [[Bruno Mars]] were working on material for [[No Doubt]]'s [[Push and Shove (album)|last album]].

It was released as the album's fourth single on May 24, 2013, for [[Music download|digital download]]. The track features American singer-songwriter [[Bruno Mars]], and rappers [[Tyga]] and [[Mystic (singer)|Mystic]]. The single version also features verses from American rapper [[2 Chainz]]. [[Diplo|Thomas Pentz]], [[Switch (house DJ)|David Taylor]], Mars, [[Tyga|Michael Stevenson]] and Mystic co-wrote the track, while production was handled by Major Lazer and [[Valentino Khan]]. Musically, it is an electronic dance, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[dancehall]] track with lyrics implying that girls twerk and show off their giant buttocks.\n\n\"Bubble Butt\" received mixed reviews from most [[music journalism|critics]]. Some complimented its engaging sound and high energy, while others criticized its lyrical content and repetitious nature. \"Bubble Butt\" found some commercial success. It was Major Lazer's first commercial single to enter the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number&nbsp;56 while reaching number eight on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. It has topped the charts in Lebanon and South Korea, and has been certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n[[Eric Wareheim]] of comedy team [[Tim & Eric]] shot the song's [[music video]]. It depicts three young women in an apartment listening to [[seapunk|seapunk music]] and taking pictures on their phones when a flying giant lands next to their apartment and inflates their buttocks. The girls start to dance with their new assets after the walls of the apartment fall off and reveal a dancefloor. Major Lazer played the song several times in their shows and in music festivals; they performed with 2 Chainz at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], at [[Rock Werchter]] in 2013, and at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in 2014. The song was included in ''[[Major Lazer Essentials]]'' (2018), their first greatest hits compilation.\n\n==Background and production==\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Diplo]] explained \"Bubble Butt\" first began taking shape while he and [[Bruno Mars]] were working on material for [[No Doubt]]'s [[Push and Shove (album)|last album]]. The producer \"put a beat on\" and Mars decided to rap.<ref name=\"RSMD\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/diplo-juggles-serious-and-silly-on-major-lazers-new-album-244027/|title=Diplo Juggles Serious and Silly on Major Lazer\u2019s New Album|last=Diehl|first=Matt|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 8, 2013|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}</ref> In another interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Ron Perry, President of Songs Publishing, explained that he wanted Diplo to sign with his company, and in order for this to happen, Diplo had requested that Perry get a \"couple rappers\" on the track.

In particular, it aims to clarify when an \"enduring predisposition\" according to the 2005 conceptual definition is present.
