Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]).<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"utr\"> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name=gonzalez/><ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]).<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism.

This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses.

'''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"pov\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Virology, 4th Edition|author= S.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Virology]]\n*[[Glossary of virology]]\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDamage caused by the virus", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

The team was founded in 1997 and is one of the eight original franchises of the league. The team is owned by [[Joe Tsai]], the majority owner of the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The team's home games are played at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].\n\nThe Liberty have qualified for the [[WNBA Playoffs]] in fourteen of its twenty-three years. The franchise has been home to many well-known players such as [[Teresa Weatherspoon]], [[Becky Hammon]], [[Leilani Mitchell]], [[Essence Carson]], and [[Cappie Pondexter]]. Through the 2016 season, the Liberty have four conference championships and have played in the [[WNBA Finals]] four times, falling to the [[Houston Comets]] in [[1997 WNBA Finals|1997]], [[1999 WNBA Finals|1999]], and [[2000 WNBA Finals|2000]], and losing to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in [[2002 WNBA Finals|2002]]. They have the most appearances in the WNBA Finals without a championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Early success (1997\u20132002)===\nPrior to the team's first season, to avoid potential trademark infringement, the team purchased the trademarks of the defunct Liberty Basketball Association.\n\nWhen the WNBA opened in 1997, the Liberty were one of the first teams to choose a player, and they signed college superstar [[Rebecca Lobo]] ([[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]]) to a contract. Lobo was a starter for two seasons but was injured in 1999, and her injuries eventually led to her retirement several seasons later. [[Point guard]] [[Teresa Weatherspoon]] emerged as a star and the Liberty made it to the 1997 championship game, where the team lost to the [[Houston Comets]]. In 1999, they added [[Crystal Robinson]] with the 6th overall pick<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232049/http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}</ref> and returned to the WNBA Finals, where they again faced the Comets. In Game 2, Teresa Weatherspoon's halfcourt shot at the buzzer gave the Liberty a one-point road win that tied the series at a game apiece. However, the Liberty lost the third game of the series and the Comets became champions for a third straight time.\n\nIn 2000, the Liberty traded for [[Tari Phillips]] who blossomed in New York and made four straight All-Star teams. In 2001, Weatherspoon became the WNBA's all-time assist leader. Teamed with Robinson, Phillips and an emerging [[Sue Wicks]], who was once a back-up to Lobo at forward but made the 2000 All-Star game, Weatherspoon and the Liberty subsequently returned to the finals in 2000 and 2002, but lost once again to the Comets and to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], respectively. The Liberty also advanced to the WNBA Eastern Conference Finals in 2001.\n\n===Transition seasons (2003\u20132009)===\n[[File:Madison Square Garden Liberty.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Madison Square Garden during a Liberty game.]]\n2003 marked a transition for the Liberty and with team leader Teresa Weatherspoon's WNBA career winding down, fan favorite [[Becky Hammon]] emerged as a star player. The 2004 season saw Hammon replacing Weatherspoon as the team's starting point guard.\n\nThe Liberty played six of their home games during the 2004 season at [[Radio City Music Hall]] as Madison Square Garden was hosting the [[2004 Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |title=PRO BASKETBALL; Liberty Opens Big on Its Home, Er, Stage|author=Lena Williams |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/sports/pro-basketball-liberty-opens-big-on-its-home-er-stage.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 July 2004 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> These games marked the first time Radio City had hosted a professional sporting event since the Roy Jones Jr. boxing match held in 1999.\n\nWith team leader [[Tari Phillips]] being signed away to the Houston Comets, [[Ann Wauters]] emerged as a force at the team's starting center position in 2005. However, she was unfortunately injured midway through the season. The loss of Wauters was felt as the team was swept two games to none by the [[Indiana Fever]] in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Liberty had a poor 2006 season, winning only 11 games, the fewest in franchise history.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 WNBA season, the team traded [[Becky Hammon]] to the [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio Silver Stars]] for [[Jessica Davenport]], a first round pick in the [[2007 WNBA Draft]]. They also acquired center [[Janel McCarville]] through the dispersal draft associated with the dissolution of the [[Charlotte Sting]]. The 2007 Liberty started out 5\u20130, then lost 7 straight games, then rallied at the end of the season to get the last playoff spot by winning 3 out of their last 4 games, beating the [[Washington Mystics]] on the tiebreaker of head-to-head record. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Liberty, as huge underdogs, faced the defending champion [[Detroit Shock]] in a best-of-three series. The Liberty defeated the Shock by winning Game 1 in New York. In Games 2 and 3 the Liberty lost both games to the Shock in Detroit, 76\u201373 and 71\u201370 (OT) respectively.\n\nIn 2008, the Liberty drafted former [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers]] shooting guard [[Essence Carson]] and former [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]] forward Erlana Larkins, and signed former [[Utah Utes women's basketball|Utah]] point guard [[Leilani Mitchell]] during the preseason. Despite having the youngest average age of any WNBA team, the Liberty managed to win 19 regular season games in 2008, to defeat the [[Connecticut Sun]] in the first round of playoff action, and to come within two points of defeating the [[Detroit Shock]] in the third and last game of the Eastern Conference Finals. Again, the Detroit series entailed a Liberty victory at home in Game 1, followed by narrow defeats away in Games 2 and 3. The 2008 season also featured the \"[[Liberty Outdoor Classic]]\", the first ever professional regular season [[basketball]] game to be played outdoors, on July 19 at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] of the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]]. The [[Indiana Fever]] defeated the Liberty in the Outdoor Classic.\n\nIn the [[2009 WNBA Draft]], the Liberty selected local favorite [[Kia Vaughn]] from Rutgers. With a solid core group, the Liberty looked to be a contender in the East yet again.\n\nIn the 2009 season, however, they never proved to be a contender and the team fired head coach [[Pat Coyle (basketball)|Pat Coyle]]. To replace Coyle, the Liberty hired then-Liberty assistant coach [[Anne Donovan]] on an interim basis. Despite the coaching change, the franchise continued to struggle, finishing 13\u201321, their second worst record in franchise history.\n\n===The Cappie Pondexter era (2010\u20132014)===\nThe New York Liberty fared better in 2010, during Donovan's first and only full season as head coach. Led by newly signed high scorer [[Cappie Pondexter]] (formerly of the [[Phoenix Mercury]]) and the 2010 [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] winner Leilani Mitchell, the team made it all the way to the [[2010 WNBA Playoffs#Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]], where they lost to the Atlanta Dream.\n\nThe team had high hopes for 2011, after the hiring of former [[2005 WNBA Finals|WNBA champion]] head coach [[John Whisenant]]. [[Janel McCarville]] did not report to training camp, seeking time with her family, and as such, was suspended for the duration of the 2011 season. This caused division and discord within the New York Liberty fanbase. [[Kia Vaughn]] was unexpectedly thrust into the role of starting Center.\n\nThe Liberty were originally scheduled to be displaced from their usual home court due to renovations at [[Madison Square Garden]] scheduled to begin in 2009. However, the renovation plans were delayed, and the Liberty played at the Garden in 2009 and 2010. The Liberty ended up playing in the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]] for their 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons while the renovations were ongoing.\n\nPondexter and [[Plenette Pierson]], along with improved play from Vaughn, allowed New York to be competitive early in the 2011 season. The team went into the [[2011 WNBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]] in third place in the Eastern Conference. In August, [[Sidney Spencer]] was traded to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in exchange for [[Kara Braxton]]. By maintaining a fairly even standard of play, the Liberty made their way into the WNBA Playoffs. However, the Liberty fell to the [[Indiana Fever]] in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\n===Isiah Thomas takes over (2015\u20132018)===\nOn May 5, 2015, the Liberty hired Thomas as Team President overseeing all business and basketball operations of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liberty introduce Team President Isiah Thomas|url=http://liberty.wnba.com/news/liberty-introduce-team-president-isiah-thomas/|website=New York Liberty}}</ref> Under Thomas' leadership as team president and the coaching staff led by [[Bill Laimbeer]] as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Marc|title=Isiah Thomas \u2013 yes, that Isiah Thomas \u2013 is Liberty's Mr. Fix-t|url=https://nypost.com/2015/08/01/isiah-thomas-yes-that-isiah-thomas-is-libertys-mr-fix-it/|website=New York Post}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2015, during halftime at the game against the [[Seattle Storm]], the New York Liberty inducted WNBA legend [[Becky Hammon]] into the Liberty's Ring of Honor.

The team was founded in 1997 and is one of the eight original franchises of the league. The team is owned by [[Joe Tsai]], the majority owner of the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The team's home games are played at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].\n\nThe Liberty have qualified for the [[WNBA Playoffs]] in fourteen of its twenty-three years. The franchise has been home to many well-known players such as [[Teresa Weatherspoon]], [[Becky Hammon]], [[Leilani Mitchell]], [[Essence Carson]], and [[Cappie Pondexter]]. Through the 2016 season, the Liberty have four conference championships and have played in the [[WNBA Finals]] four times, falling to the [[Houston Comets]] in [[1997 WNBA Finals|1997]], [[1999 WNBA Finals|1999]], and [[2000 WNBA Finals|2000]], and losing to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] in [[2002 WNBA Finals|2002]]. They have the most appearances in the WNBA Finals without a championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Early success (1997\u20132002)===\nPrior to the team's first season, to avoid potential trademark infringement, the team purchased the trademarks of the defunct Liberty Basketball Association.\n\nWhen the WNBA opened in 1997, the Liberty were one of the first teams to choose a player, and they signed college superstar [[Rebecca Lobo]] ([[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]]) to a contract. Lobo was a starter for two seasons but was injured in 1999, and her injuries eventually led to her retirement several seasons later. [[Point guard]] [[Teresa Weatherspoon]] emerged as a star and the Liberty made it to the 1997 championship game, where the team lost to the [[Houston Comets]]. In 1999, they added [[Crystal Robinson]] with the 6th overall pick<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232049/http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/crystal_robinson/bio.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}</ref> and returned to the WNBA Finals, where they again faced the Comets. In Game 2, Teresa Weatherspoon's halfcourt shot at the buzzer gave the Liberty a one-point road win that tied the series at a game apiece. However, the Liberty lost the third game of the series and the Comets became champions for a third straight time.\n\nIn 2000, the Liberty traded for [[Tari Phillips]] who blossomed in New York and made four straight All-Star teams. In 2001, Weatherspoon became the WNBA's all-time assist leader. Teamed with Robinson, Phillips and an emerging [[Sue Wicks]], who was once a back-up to Lobo at forward but made the 2000 All-Star game, Weatherspoon and the Liberty subsequently returned to the finals in 2000 and 2002, but lost once again to the Comets and to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], respectively. The Liberty also advanced to the WNBA Eastern Conference Finals in 2001.\n\n===Transition seasons (2003\u20132009)===\n[[File:Madison Square Garden Liberty.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Madison Square Garden during a Liberty game.]]\n2003 marked a transition for the Liberty and with team leader Teresa Weatherspoon's WNBA career winding down, fan favorite [[Becky Hammon]] emerged as a star player. The 2004 season saw Hammon replacing Weatherspoon as the team's starting point guard.\n\nThe Liberty played six of their home games during the 2004 season at [[Radio City Music Hall]] as Madison Square Garden was hosting the [[2004 Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |title=PRO BASKETBALL; Liberty Opens Big on Its Home, Er, Stage|author=Lena Williams |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/sports/pro-basketball-liberty-opens-big-on-its-home-er-stage.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 July 2004 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> These games marked the first time Radio City had hosted a professional sporting event since the Roy Jones Jr. boxing match held in 1999.\n\nWith team leader [[Tari Phillips]] being signed away to the Houston Comets, [[Ann Wauters]] emerged as a force at the team's starting center position in 2005. However, she was unfortunately injured midway through the season. The loss of Wauters was felt as the team was swept two games to none by the [[Indiana Fever]] in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Liberty had a poor 2006 season, winning only 11 games, the fewest in franchise history.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 WNBA season, the team traded [[Becky Hammon]] to the [[San Antonio Stars|San Antonio Silver Stars]] for [[Jessica Davenport]], a first round pick in the [[2007 WNBA Draft]]. They also acquired center [[Janel McCarville]] through the dispersal draft associated with the dissolution of the [[Charlotte Sting]]. The 2007 Liberty started out 5\u20130, then lost 7 straight games, then rallied at the end of the season to get the last playoff spot by winning 3 out of their last 4 games, beating the [[Washington Mystics]] on the tiebreaker of head-to-head record. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Liberty, as huge underdogs, faced the defending champion [[Detroit Shock]] in a best-of-three series. The Liberty defeated the Shock by winning Game 1 in New York. In Games 2 and 3 the Liberty lost both games to the Shock in Detroit, 76\u201373 and 71\u201370 (OT) respectively.\n\nIn 2008, the Liberty drafted former [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers]] shooting guard [[Essence Carson]] and former [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]] forward Erlana Larkins, and signed former [[Utah Utes women's basketball|Utah]] point guard [[Leilani Mitchell]] during the preseason. Despite having the youngest average age of any WNBA team, the Liberty managed to win 19 regular season games in 2008, to defeat the [[Connecticut Sun]] in the first round of playoff action, and to come within two points of defeating the [[Detroit Shock]] in the third and last game of the Eastern Conference Finals. Again, the Detroit series entailed a Liberty victory at home in Game 1, followed by narrow defeats away in Games 2 and 3. The 2008 season also featured the \"[[Liberty Outdoor Classic]]\", the first ever professional regular season [[basketball]] game to be played outdoors, on July 19 at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] of the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]]. The [[Indiana Fever]] defeated the Liberty in the Outdoor Classic.\n\nIn the [[2009 WNBA Draft]], the Liberty selected local favorite [[Kia Vaughn]] from Rutgers. With a solid core group, the Liberty looked to be a contender in the East yet again.\n\nIn the 2009 season, however, they never proved to be a contender and the team fired head coach [[Pat Coyle (basketball)|Pat Coyle]]. To replace Coyle, the Liberty hired then-Liberty assistant coach [[Anne Donovan]] on an interim basis. Despite the coaching change, the franchise continued to struggle, finishing 13\u201321, their second worst record in franchise history.\n\n===The Cappie Pondexter era (2010\u20132014)===\nThe New York Liberty fared better in 2010, during Donovan's first and only full season as head coach. Led by newly signed high scorer [[Cappie Pondexter]] (formerly of the [[Phoenix Mercury]]) and the 2010 [[WNBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] winner Leilani Mitchell, the team made it all the way to the [[2010 WNBA Playoffs#Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]], where they lost to the Atlanta Dream.\n\nThe team had high hopes for 2011, after the hiring of former [[2005 WNBA Finals|WNBA champion]] head coach [[John Whisenant]]. [[Janel McCarville]] did not report to training camp, seeking time with her family, and as such, was suspended for the duration of the 2011 season. This caused division and discord within the New York Liberty fanbase. [[Kia Vaughn]] was unexpectedly thrust into the role of starting Center.\n\nThe Liberty were originally scheduled to be displaced from their usual home court due to renovations at [[Madison Square Garden]] scheduled to begin in 2009. However, the renovation plans were delayed, and the Liberty played at the Garden in 2009 and 2010. The Liberty ended up playing in the [[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]] for their 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons while the renovations were ongoing.\n\nPondexter and [[Plenette Pierson]], along with improved play from Vaughn, allowed New York to be competitive early in the 2011 season. The team went into the [[2011 WNBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]] in third place in the Eastern Conference. In August, [[Sidney Spencer]] was traded to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in exchange for [[Kara Braxton]]. By maintaining a fairly even standard of play, the Liberty made their way into the WNBA Playoffs. However, the Liberty fell to the [[Indiana Fever]] in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\n===Isiah Thomas takes over (2015\u20132018)===\nOn May 5, 2015, the Liberty hired Thomas as Team President overseeing all business and basketball operations of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liberty introduce Team President Isiah Thomas|url=http://liberty.wnba.com/news/liberty-introduce-team-president-isiah-thomas/|website=New York Liberty}}</ref> Under Thomas' leadership as team president and the coaching staff led by [[Bill Laimbeer]] as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Marc|title=Isiah Thomas \u2013 yes, that Isiah Thomas \u2013 is Liberty's Mr. Fix-t|url=https://nypost.com/2015/08/01/isiah-thomas-yes-that-isiah-thomas-is-libertys-mr-fix-it/|website=New York Post}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2015, during halftime at the game against the [[Seattle Storm]], the New York Liberty inducted WNBA legend [[Becky Hammon]] into the Liberty's Ring of Honor. Thomas presented Hammon with her ring during the induction ceremony at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Hammon, a former New York Liberty point guard, is currently an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] assistant coach for the [[San Antonio Spurs]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bacharach|first1=Erik|title=Becky Hammon inducted into Liberty's Ring of Honor|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/liberty/becky-hammon-inducted-into-liberty-s-ring-of-honor-1.10700903|website=Newsday}}</ref>\n\nAfter qualifying for the [[2016 WNBA Playoffs]], the Liberty lost to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=New York Liberty get eliminated by Phoenix Mercury|url=http://www.wnba.com/game/20160924phonyl/|last=|first=|date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2017, the Madison Square Garden Company and [[James L.
