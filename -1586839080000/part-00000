Under the name 'Brunswick Juventus', the club participated in the [[National Soccer League]] from [[1984 National Soccer League|1984]] to [[1988 National Soccer League|1988]], where they would be national champions in [[1985 National Soccer League|1985]] and southern conference premiers in [[1986 National Soccer League|1986]]. The club again participated in the national competition for the [[1993\u201394 National Soccer League|1993\u201394]] and [[1994\u201395 National Soccer League|1994\u201395]] seasons under the names 'Brunswick Pumas' and 'Melbourne Zebras' respectively.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/VIC/Vic_Active_M.html#MorelandZebras</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Name history===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! | Name\n! | Period\n\n|-\n|Juventus||1948\u20131979\n|-\n|Brunswick United Juventus||1980\u20131993\n|-\n|Brunswick Pumas||1993\u20131994\n|-\n|Melbourne Zebras||1994\u20131995\n|-\n|Brunswick Zebras||1996\u2013present\n|-\n|}\n\n===Establishment and early success (1949\u20131969)===\nThe club was established by [[Italian community of Melbourne|Melbourne's Italian community]] in 1948 as 'Juventus', named after [[Juventus F.C.|the Italian club]]. The decision to name the club Juventus was due to the agreement of [[Neutrality (philosophy)|political neutrality]] by the founding members as the club was partly established remnants of several smaller clubs in [[Melbourne]], including [[Savoia SC|Savoia]] that was founded in the early 1930s, and is believed to have been Victoria's first Italian sporting club.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124209-0-0&sID=314519</ref> The first competitive match was played on 16 April 1949, being the first round of the Victorian third tier league, that is now the [[Victorian State League Division 1]] as of 2019. Juventus defeated [[Brighton SC]] 8-2 away, in what would be the beginning of a thirteen game winning streak<ref>http://www.socceraust.co.uk/1949/VIC/Div3/fixtures.html</ref> that would ultimately help the club finish second and be promoted at the season's conclusion.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1950D2T.html</ref>\n\nBrunswick Juventus became the dominant side in Victoria in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five consecutive titles from 1952 to 1956, and were arguably the club which ushered in the European migrant dominance of Victorian football which remains to the present. In the 1960s, while the club remained more than competitive, the rise of other migrant clubs, principally the [[Greek community of Melbourne|Greek backed]] [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] and the [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav backed]] [[Footscray JUST]], saw this dominance ended and the club waited until 1970 to add to its trophies.\n\n===Financial difficulties and mixed results (1970\u20131981)===\nThe club largely struggled in the league during the 1970s due to financial difficulty after their 1970 championship and [[Dockerty Cup]] victory.<ref>https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/41784</ref><ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124191-0-0&sID=341425</ref> With the exception of finishing third in 1977, the team would finish no higher than mid-table and narrowly avoided relegation multiple times.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/VIC/Vic_Active_M.html#MorelandZebras</ref> though there were would be another four [[Dockerty Cup]] wins during this time. As a result, the club decided not to pursue membership of the newly established [[National Soccer League]] in [[1977 National Soccer League|1977]], and would later change the club name from 'Juventus' to 'Brunswick United Juventus' in 1980.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124191-0-0&sID=341425</ref>\n\n===Improved results and first national league stint (1982\u20131988)===\nWith financial stability being regained in the early 1980s, the team finished third in both 1982 and 1983. When the [[Football Federation Australia|national federation]] decided to implement a geographical conference system for the [[1984 National Soccer League|1984 season]] to reduce travel expenses, Brunswick applied for the southern conference and were accepted, becoming the first Italian backed Melbourne club to compete at a national level.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124209-0-0&sID=314519</ref> Brunswick would reach the finals in their debut season, but it would be the [[1985 National Soccer League|1985 season]] that would see the club peek in its glory.\n\nBrunswick finished second on the southern ladder<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1985/NSLTable.html</ref> but would defeat [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg United]], South Melbourne and [[Preston Lions|Preston]] in the southern conference play-offs before eventually defeating [[Sydney City Soccer Club|Sydney City]] over two legs in the national grand final.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1985/Playoff.html</ref> In [[1986 National Soccer League|1986]] Brunswick finished first on the southern conference table,<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1986/NSLTable.html</ref> but consecutive losses to [[Adelaide City]] and [[Footscray JUST]] in the conference play-offs ended their season<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1986/Playoff.html</ref> and was the last season in which they were to be finals competitive at national league level. Finishing eighth and thirteenth respectively in the [[1987 National Soccer League|1987]] and [[1988 National Soccer League|1988]] seasons saw Brunswick be relegated back to the Victorian state system.\n\n===Return to state league and second national league stint (1989\u20131996)===\nWith two non-competitive seasons in the national league, the senior team commenced 1989 in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria|state league]] where they would finish second, and would repeat this feat in 1990. After its last first place finish at the highest state level in 1977, the club would break its twenty one year gap, finishing ahead of second-placed and fellow Italian backed club [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen]] by ten goals after being equal on thirty-eight points.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1991PLT.html</ref> Another competitive season in 1993 saw Brunswick be re-admitted to the national league for the [[1993\u201394 National Soccer League|1993\u201394 season]], changing its name to 'Brunswick Pumas' in accordance with federation's ruling of removing [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnicism]] from club names.\n\nThe return to the national wouldn't be as successful as the clubs first stint, with the pumas finishing second last.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/9394/NSLTable.html</ref> The season after, the club would change its name again for the fourth time in its history to 'Melbourne Zebras' in an attempt to gain a larger support base around [[Melbourne]]. On the field, the squad's performances slightly improved in finishing third last.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/9495/NSLTable.html</ref> However, with a stronger fan base not developing fast enough for the federations liking, and in a greater attempt to remove ethnicism from the sport as a whole, the federation decided to remove the Zebras and [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg United]] from the [[1995\u201396 National Soccer League|1995\u201396 season]] at late notice. Outraged, both clubs obtained court injunctions to prevent the league season going ahead. Eventually, the injunction was lifted in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] to allow the league to start, albeit several weeks late.<ref name=\"smh-cock-court\">{{Cite news |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news950920_0121_2268 |title=Court clears deck for A-teams |last=Cockerill, Michael |date=20 September 1995 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216104111/http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news950920_0121_2268 |archive-date=16 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"smh-cock-bigleague\">{{Cite news |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&docID=news951001_0109_5800 |title=A-League far from the big league |last=Cockerill, Michael |date=1 October 1995 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216141739/http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&docID=news951001_0109_5800 |archive-date=16 February 2015 |quote=Following an exhaustive and acrimonious legal process in which the lawyers (as usual) were the only winners, a revamped national competition - to be known as the A-League - will kick-off next weekend. |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Club break off and re-establishment (1997\u2013present)===\nFollowing dismissal from the national league, the club was allowed to return to the state league system's first tier league for a second time. It was at this time however that the club had developed dissension among its members, that resulted in the club being split into three groups. The 'Brunswick' group that contained the original Australian Business Number remained based at Sumner park, a tenancy that continues as of 2019. The 'Juventus' group would merge with fellow Italian backed clubs [[Box Hill United SC|Box Hill]], [[Bulleen]], and Clayton to create '[[Moreland Zebras FC|Bulleen Inter Kings]]', taking with it the license to compete in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria|premier league]] for the 1997 season. The third group, referred to as the 'Zebras' group would merge with Italian backed Thomastown Devils to become '[[Whittlesea Ranges FC|Thomastown Zebras]]', to also compete in the premier league. In 2000, the two clubs would re-merge to create the 'Bulleen Zebras', and later the [[Moreland Zebras FC|Moreland Zebras]] in 2009.<ref>https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-GeBc7j6xA6ZHNuY3ZTaVBHWXc/edit</ref> Both [[Moreland Zebras FC|Moreland]] and [[Whittlesea Ranges FC|Whittlesea Ranges]], now both playing in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2]], Victoria's second tier of state football, disputedly claim a lineage to the Brunswick Zebras Football Club and all of its achievements prior to 1996.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/sep/08/forgotten-story-brunswick-juventus-1985-nsl</ref>\n\nWhile not playing football for ten years, the football club maintained the ABN and tenancy of Sumner Park, and recommenced football operations in 2007 as 'Brunswick Zebras Soccer Club'.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2007PD3NWT.html</ref> The senior men's team were granted license to compete in [[Victorian State League Division 5|state tier seven league]], then known as 'Provisional League Division 3' in the North-West conference.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2007PD3NWT.html</ref> In 2008, the club renamed itself for a fifth time to its present name of 'Brunswick Zebras Football Club' and updated its emblem. The year also saw the rebranded club develop its first senior female football team, gaining entrance into the state tier five league, playing in the north-west conference also.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2008WMLNWT.html</ref>\n\nThe 2011 season saw the club and the senior men win its first premiership in twenty years, finishing first in the [[Victorian State League Division 5|seventh tier state league]].<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2011PD3NWT.html</ref> The women's senior team would win its first-ever premiership eleven years after its founding, finishing first in the state tier four league northern conference.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124191-514459-0&pool=1001&a=LADDER</ref> With the club seeing itself as 'as a sports club with a social purpose', the 2016 season saw the club have 500 registered players, 200 of which were female.<ref>https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-singing-wolf-at-the-heart-of-brunswicks-community-soccer-revival-20160914-grfwq2.html</ref>\nAs of 2019, the club is headed by politician

The club again participated in the national competition for the [[1993\u201394 National Soccer League|1993\u201394]] and [[1994\u201395 National Soccer League|1994\u201395]] seasons under the names 'Brunswick Pumas' and 'Melbourne Zebras' respectively.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/VIC/Vic_Active_M.html#MorelandZebras</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Name history===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! | Name\n! | Period\n\n|-\n|Juventus||1948\u20131979\n|-\n|Brunswick United Juventus||1980\u20131993\n|-\n|Brunswick Pumas||1993\u20131994\n|-\n|Melbourne Zebras||1994\u20131995\n|-\n|Brunswick Zebras||1996\u2013present\n|-\n|}\n\n===Establishment and early success (1949\u20131969)===\nThe club was established by [[Italian community of Melbourne|Melbourne's Italian community]] in 1948 as 'Juventus', named after [[Juventus F.C.|the Italian club]]. The decision to name the club Juventus was due to the agreement of [[Neutrality (philosophy)|political neutrality]] by the founding members as the club was partly established remnants of several smaller clubs in [[Melbourne]], including [[Savoia SC|Savoia]] that was founded in the early 1930s, and is believed to have been Victoria's first Italian sporting club.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124209-0-0&sID=314519</ref> The first competitive match was played on 16 April 1949, being the first round of the Victorian third tier league, that is now the [[Victorian State League Division 1]] as of 2019. Juventus defeated [[Brighton SC]] 8-2 away, in what would be the beginning of a thirteen game winning streak<ref>http://www.socceraust.co.uk/1949/VIC/Div3/fixtures.html</ref> that would ultimately help the club finish second and be promoted at the season's conclusion.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1950D2T.html</ref>\n\nBrunswick Juventus became the dominant side in Victoria in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five consecutive titles from 1952 to 1956, and were arguably the club which ushered in the European migrant dominance of Victorian football which remains to the present. In the 1960s, while the club remained more than competitive, the rise of other migrant clubs, principally the [[Greek community of Melbourne|Greek backed]] [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] and the [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav backed]] [[Footscray JUST]], saw this dominance ended and the club waited until 1970 to add to its trophies.\n\n===Financial difficulties and mixed results (1970\u20131981)===\nThe club largely struggled in the league during the 1970s due to financial difficulty after their 1970 championship and [[Dockerty Cup]] victory.<ref>https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/41784</ref><ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124191-0-0&sID=341425</ref> With the exception of finishing third in 1977, the team would finish no higher than mid-table and narrowly avoided relegation multiple times.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/VIC/Vic_Active_M.html#MorelandZebras</ref> though there were would be another four [[Dockerty Cup]] wins during this time. As a result, the club decided not to pursue membership of the newly established [[National Soccer League]] in [[1977 National Soccer League|1977]], and would later change the club name from 'Juventus' to 'Brunswick United Juventus' in 1980.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124191-0-0&sID=341425</ref>\n\n===Improved results and first national league stint (1982\u20131988)===\nWith financial stability being regained in the early 1980s, the team finished third in both 1982 and 1983. When the [[Football Federation Australia|national federation]] decided to implement a geographical conference system for the [[1984 National Soccer League|1984 season]] to reduce travel expenses, Brunswick applied for the southern conference and were accepted, becoming the first Italian backed Melbourne club to compete at a national level.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124209-0-0&sID=314519</ref> Brunswick would reach the finals in their debut season, but it would be the [[1985 National Soccer League|1985 season]] that would see the club peek in its glory.\n\nBrunswick finished second on the southern ladder<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1985/NSLTable.html</ref> but would defeat [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg United]], South Melbourne and [[Preston Lions|Preston]] in the southern conference play-offs before eventually defeating [[Sydney City Soccer Club|Sydney City]] over two legs in the national grand final.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1985/Playoff.html</ref> In [[1986 National Soccer League|1986]] Brunswick finished first on the southern conference table,<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1986/NSLTable.html</ref> but consecutive losses to [[Adelaide City]] and [[Footscray JUST]] in the conference play-offs ended their season<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1986/Playoff.html</ref> and was the last season in which they were to be finals competitive at national league level. Finishing eighth and thirteenth respectively in the [[1987 National Soccer League|1987]] and [[1988 National Soccer League|1988]] seasons saw Brunswick be relegated back to the Victorian state system.\n\n===Return to state league and second national league stint (1989\u20131996)===\nWith two non-competitive seasons in the national league, the senior team commenced 1989 in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria|state league]] where they would finish second, and would repeat this feat in 1990. After its last first place finish at the highest state level in 1977, the club would break its twenty one year gap, finishing ahead of second-placed and fellow Italian backed club [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen]] by ten goals after being equal on thirty-eight points.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1991PLT.html</ref> Another competitive season in 1993 saw Brunswick be re-admitted to the national league for the [[1993\u201394 National Soccer League|1993\u201394 season]], changing its name to 'Brunswick Pumas' in accordance with federation's ruling of removing [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnicism]] from club names.\n\nThe return to the national wouldn't be as successful as the clubs first stint, with the pumas finishing second last.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/9394/NSLTable.html</ref> The season after, the club would change its name again for the fourth time in its history to 'Melbourne Zebras' in an attempt to gain a larger support base around [[Melbourne]]. On the field, the squad's performances slightly improved in finishing third last.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/9495/NSLTable.html</ref> However, with a stronger fan base not developing fast enough for the federations liking, and in a greater attempt to remove ethnicism from the sport as a whole, the federation decided to remove the Zebras and [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg United]] from the [[1995\u201396 National Soccer League|1995\u201396 season]] at late notice. Outraged, both clubs obtained court injunctions to prevent the league season going ahead. Eventually, the injunction was lifted in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] to allow the league to start, albeit several weeks late.<ref name=\"smh-cock-court\">{{Cite news |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news950920_0121_2268 |title=Court clears deck for A-teams |last=Cockerill, Michael |date=20 September 1995 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216104111/http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news950920_0121_2268 |archive-date=16 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"smh-cock-bigleague\">{{Cite news |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&docID=news951001_0109_5800 |title=A-League far from the big league |last=Cockerill, Michael |date=1 October 1995 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216141739/http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&docID=news951001_0109_5800 |archive-date=16 February 2015 |quote=Following an exhaustive and acrimonious legal process in which the lawyers (as usual) were the only winners, a revamped national competition - to be known as the A-League - will kick-off next weekend. |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Club break off and re-establishment (1997\u2013present)===\nFollowing dismissal from the national league, the club was allowed to return to the state league system's first tier league for a second time. It was at this time however that the club had developed dissension among its members, that resulted in the club being split into three groups. The 'Brunswick' group that contained the original Australian Business Number remained based at Sumner park, a tenancy that continues as of 2019. The 'Juventus' group would merge with fellow Italian backed clubs [[Box Hill United SC|Box Hill]], [[Bulleen]], and Clayton to create '[[Moreland Zebras FC|Bulleen Inter Kings]]', taking with it the license to compete in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria|premier league]] for the 1997 season. The third group, referred to as the 'Zebras' group would merge with Italian backed Thomastown Devils to become '[[Whittlesea Ranges FC|Thomastown Zebras]]', to also compete in the premier league. In 2000, the two clubs would re-merge to create the 'Bulleen Zebras', and later the [[Moreland Zebras FC|Moreland Zebras]] in 2009.<ref>https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-GeBc7j6xA6ZHNuY3ZTaVBHWXc/edit</ref> Both [[Moreland Zebras FC|Moreland]] and [[Whittlesea Ranges FC|Whittlesea Ranges]], now both playing in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2]], Victoria's second tier of state football, disputedly claim a lineage to the Brunswick Zebras Football Club and all of its achievements prior to 1996.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/sep/08/forgotten-story-brunswick-juventus-1985-nsl</ref>\n\nWhile not playing football for ten years, the football club maintained the ABN and tenancy of Sumner Park, and recommenced football operations in 2007 as 'Brunswick Zebras Soccer Club'.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2007PD3NWT.html</ref> The senior men's team were granted license to compete in [[Victorian State League Division 5|state tier seven league]], then known as 'Provisional League Division 3' in the North-West conference.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2007PD3NWT.html</ref> In 2008, the club renamed itself for a fifth time to its present name of 'Brunswick Zebras Football Club' and updated its emblem. The year also saw the rebranded club develop its first senior female football team, gaining entrance into the state tier five league, playing in the north-west conference also.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2008WMLNWT.html</ref>\n\nThe 2011 season saw the club and the senior men win its first premiership in twenty years, finishing first in the [[Victorian State League Division 5|seventh tier state league]].<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2011PD3NWT.html</ref> The women's senior team would win its first-ever premiership eleven years after its founding, finishing first in the state tier four league northern conference.<ref>http://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-8746-124191-514459-0&pool=1001&a=LADDER</ref> With the club seeing itself as 'as a sports club with a social purpose', the 2016 season saw the club have 500 registered players, 200 of which were female.<ref>https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-singing-wolf-at-the-heart-of-brunswicks-community-soccer-revival-20160914-grfwq2.html</ref>\nAs of 2019, the club is headed by politician

Helm.JPG|thumb|Helm of [[Golden Bear (ship)|TS ''Golden Bear'']]|left]]\nA typical ship's wheel is composed of eight cylindrical wooden [[spokes]] (though sometimes as few as six or as many as ten) shaped like [[balusters]] and all joined at a central wooden [[wheel|hub]] or ''nave'' (sometimes covered with a brass ''nave plate'') which housed the [[axle]].  The square hole at the centre of the hub through which the axle ran is called the ''drive square'' and was often lined with a brass plate (and therefore called a ''brass boss'', though this term was used more often to refer to a brass hub and nave plate) which was frequently etched with the name of the wheel's manufacturer. The outer rim is composed of sections each made up of stacks of three ''felloes'', the ''facing felloe'', the ''middle felloe'', and the ''after felloe''.  Because each group of three felloes at one time made up a quarter of the distance around the rim, the entire outer wooden wheel was sometimes called the ''quadrant''. Each spoke ran through the middle felloe creating a series of handles beyond the wheel's rim.  One of these handles/ spokes was frequently provided with extra grooves at its tip which could be felt by a helmsman steering in the dark and used by him to determine the exact position of the rudder\u2014this was the ''king spoke'' and when it pointed straight upward the rudder was believed to be dead straight to the hull.  The completed ship's wheel and associated axle and pedestal(s) might even be taller than the person using it. The wood used in construction of this type of wheel was most often either [[teak]] or [[mahogany]], both of which are very durable tropical [[hardwood]]s capable of surviving the effects of salt water spray and regular use without significant decomposition. Modern design\u2014particularly on smaller vessels\u2014can deviate from the template.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Wheel and rudder assembly.gif|x250px|thumb|Diagram of the operation of a tiller using a ship's wheel and tiller ropes.]]\n\nThe steering gear of earlier ships's wheels sometimes consisted of a double wheel where each wheel was connected to the other with a wooden ''spindle'' that ran through a ''barrel'' or ''drum''.  The spindle was held up by two ''pedestals'' that rested on a wooden ''platform'', often no more than a grate.  A ''tiller rope'' or ''tiller chain'' (sometimes called a ''steering rope'' or ''steering chain'') ran around the barrel in five or six loops and then down through two ''tiller rope/ chain slots'' at the top of the platform before connecting to two [[sheave]]s just below deck (one on either side of the ship's wheel) and thence out to a pair of pulleys before coming back together at the tiller and connecting to the ship's rudder.  Movement of the wheels (which were connected and moved in unison) caused the tiller rope to wind in one of two directions and angled the tiller left or right.  In a typical and intuitive arrangement, a forward-facing helmsman turning the wheel ''counter''clockwise would cause the tiller to angle to starboard and therefore the rudder to swing to port causing the vessel to also turn to port (see animation).<ref name=wolfram/>{{rp|p.152}}  On many vessels the helmsman stood facing the rear of the ship with the ship's wheel before him and the rest of the ship behind him\u2014 {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} this still meant that the direction of travel of the wheel at its apex corresponded to the direction of turn of the ship.

Helm.JPG|thumb|Helm of [[Golden Bear (ship)|TS ''Golden Bear'']]|left]]\nA typical ship's wheel is composed of eight cylindrical wooden [[spokes]] (though sometimes as few as six or as many as ten) shaped like [[balusters]] and all joined at a central wooden [[wheel|hub]] or ''nave'' (sometimes covered with a brass ''nave plate'') which housed the [[axle]].  The square hole at the centre of the hub through which the axle ran is called the ''drive square'' and was often lined with a brass plate (and therefore called a ''brass boss'', though this term was used more often to refer to a brass hub and nave plate) which was frequently etched with the name of the wheel's manufacturer. The outer rim is composed of sections each made up of stacks of three ''felloes'', the ''facing felloe'', the ''middle felloe'', and the ''after felloe''.  Because each group of three felloes at one time made up a quarter of the distance around the rim, the entire outer wooden wheel was sometimes called the ''quadrant''. Each spoke ran through the middle felloe creating a series of handles beyond the wheel's rim.  One of these handles/ spokes was frequently provided with extra grooves at its tip which could be felt by a helmsman steering in the dark and used by him to determine the exact position of the rudder\u2014this was the ''king spoke'' and when it pointed straight upward the rudder was believed to be dead straight to the hull.  The completed ship's wheel and associated axle and pedestal(s) might even be taller than the person using it. The wood used in construction of this type of wheel was most often either [[teak]] or [[mahogany]], both of which are very durable tropical [[hardwood]]s capable of surviving the effects of salt water spray and regular use without significant decomposition. Modern design\u2014particularly on smaller vessels\u2014can deviate from the template.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Wheel and rudder assembly.gif|x250px|thumb|Diagram of the operation of a tiller using a ship's wheel and tiller ropes.]]\n\nThe steering gear of earlier ships's wheels sometimes consisted of a double wheel where each wheel was connected to the other with a wooden ''spindle'' that ran through a ''barrel'' or ''drum''.  The spindle was held up by two ''pedestals'' that rested on a wooden ''platform'', often no more than a grate.  A ''tiller rope'' or ''tiller chain'' (sometimes called a ''steering rope'' or ''steering chain'') ran around the barrel in five or six loops and then down through two ''tiller rope/ chain slots'' at the top of the platform before connecting to two [[sheave]]s just below deck (one on either side of the ship's wheel) and thence out to a pair of pulleys before coming back together at the tiller and connecting to the ship's rudder.  Movement of the wheels (which were connected and moved in unison) caused the tiller rope to wind in one of two directions and angled the tiller left or right.  In a typical and intuitive arrangement, a forward-facing helmsman turning the wheel ''counter''clockwise would cause the tiller to angle to starboard and therefore the rudder to swing to port causing the vessel to also turn to port (see animation).<ref name=wolfram/>{{rp|p.152}}  On many vessels the helmsman stood facing the rear of the ship with the ship's wheel before him and the rest of the ship behind him\u2014 {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} this still meant that the direction of travel of the wheel at its apex corresponded to the direction of turn of the ship.  Having two wheels connected by an axle allowed two people to take the helm in severe weather when one person alone might not have had enough strength to control the ship's movements.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Britannia Yacht Club Commodore Boardroom.jpg|[[Britannia Yacht Club]]'s Commodore Boardroom features a ship's wheel table\nFile:Annunciator.jpg|[[USS LST-325|USS ''LST-325'']] ship's wheel and [[engine order telegraph]]\nFile:US Navy 050823-N-9076B-001 Electrician's Mate 1st Class Aaron Walker speaks to chief petty officer selectees as he stands at the helm of USS Constitution in Boston.jpg|U.S. Navy personnel aboard the {{USS| Constitution}}, by the ship's wheel\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Steering engine]]\n* [[Steering wheel]]\n* [[Tiller]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Steering wheels (ship part)}}\n\n{{Sailing ship elements}}\n\n[[Category:Control devices]]\n[[Category:Watercraft components]]\n", "name_user": "Lockesdonkey", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGallery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship%27s_wheel"}

It seems unlikely that he invented the stiletto, but he is probably the first firmly-documented designer of the high, slim heel. The word stiletto applied to a heel is derived from a [[knife]] or [[dagger]] [[stiletto]], which is a long, thin blade, to which the heel of the shoe is similar in profile.

Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels. The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nStiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the ''[[femme fatale]]''. They are often considered to be a seductive item of clothing, and often feature in popular culture in this context.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Advantages==\nSome of the benefits of wearing stilettos and other high heels include; longer, sexier, hotter and more feminine legs, it boosts your self-confidence, it makes your legs look slimmer and longer while making you look taller and it helps to strengthen & work your foot, heel, calf, knee and thigh muscles. It even makes your foot look smaller. It makes you safer by being used as a standby weapon to protect from rapists and molesters. And of course if your man is having an affair, you have something ready to kick him with or throw at him.\n\nAdditionally, it makes you look more stylish and sexy when pairing up with tights, stockings or a pantyhose, it helps to enhance your body figure by lifting up your butt, flattening your stomach areas, accentuating you breasts and overall makes you look desirable. Last but certainly not least, it gains you more and special attention from males around. In fact, one of my friends always turns around when he sees a woman in stilettos, click-clacking past and stares at her receding figure in awe, admiration and desire.\n\nIt will help you in work, making you look more important and powerful like Yahoo!'s Marissa Mayer and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and if your job involves public relations, men will be more polite and respectful. In fact a study proved that when woman where heels above 4\", men are willing to help them 3 times more than if they were wearing heels between 2\" and 4\" and 7 times more than if they were wearing heels below 2\" or flats.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nAll high heels counter the natural functionality of the foot, sometimes causing skeletal and muscular problems if users wear them excessively; such shoes are a common cause of [[venous]] complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs, and have been found to provoke [[venous hypertension]] in the lower limbs.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Wagner|first= T.F.|title= Influence of high-heeled shoes on venous function in young women|journal= Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume= 56|issue= 4|pages= 1039\u20131044|publisher= [[Society for Vascular Surgery]]|date= October 2012|url= http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(12)00117-6/abstract|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2012.01.039|doi-access= free}}</ref> Despite their impracticality and fluctuating demand, they persist as a fashion option.\n\nStiletto heels concentrate a large amount of force into a small area.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.
