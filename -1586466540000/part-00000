Three jetties were built: one on the east from Brossard, one on the west from Nuns' Island, and one from the center, adjacent to a dike along the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].\n*The pier through the canal, allowed, by means of [[cofferdam]]s, the storage of piles of construction material.\n*The central jetty served as a construction platform for the piers and towers of the section of the bridge utilizing [[guy-wire]]s. Temporary pillars used during the construction of the [[Millau Viaduct]] in [[France]] were erected to support the cable-stayed span during construction. The main cable-stayed span above the seaway was assembled in segments by means of a crane.\n*The 500-meter (550 yard) long west pier was divided into three pre-assembly areas: a first for the concrete foundation footings that serve as the base for the viaduct section crossing the river, a second for the steel headers that complete the piles, and a third for the steel superstructures that wear the aprons. During the prefabrication of the 38 marine insoles, a pile primer and working platform were added to form a pile base measuring up to 14 meters (45') high. A super-transporter moved these stack bases from the prefabrication area to a loading area from where they were lifted by an industrial catamaran. The catamaran then deposited these bases in spaces drilled to a depth of 4 to 5 meters (15') in the riverbed. Two floating cranes finally overlaid the bases of the prefabricated elements to form piles and headers. The steel box girders supporting the three decks of the bridge were then deposited on the trimmers as they were completed.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of crossings of the Saint Lawrence River#Quebec|List of crossings of the Saint Lawrence River]]\n* [[List of bridges in Montreal]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline|Samuel-De Champlain Bridge}}\n\n{{Crossings navbox\n|structure        = Bridges\n|place            = [[St. Lawrence River]]\n|bridge           = Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge\n|bridge signs     = [[File:Quebec Autoroute 10.svg|25px]] [[File:Quebec Autoroute 15.svg|25px]] [[File:Quebec Autoroute 20.svg|25px]]\n|upstream         = [[Honor\u00e9 Mercier Bridge]]\n|upstream signs   = [[Image:qc138.svg|25px]]\n|downstream       = [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]]\n|downstream signs = [[Image:qc112.svg|25px]]\n}}\n\n{{Streets in Montreal}}\n\n{{Urban agglomeration of Longueuil}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Champlain Bridge, Montreal (2019-present)}}\n[[Category:Cable-stayed bridges]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 2019]]\n[[Category:Bridges in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Transport in Brossard]]\n[[Category:Bridges over the Saint Lawrence River]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Brossard]]\n[[Category:Verdun, Quebec]]\n[[Category:Le Sud-Ouest]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in Quebec]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Bridge over the Saint Lawrence River in Montreal, Quebec}}\n{{About|the newly constructed bridge spanning the Saint Lawrence River|the old bridge it replaced|Champlain Bridge, Montreal (1962\u20132019)}}\n{{others|Champlain Bridge (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox bridge\n| bridge_name      = Samuel De Champlain Bridge\n| native_name      = {{native name|fr|Pont Samuel-De Champlain}}\n| image            = File:Samuel de Champlain Bridge from east.jpg\n| image_size       = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = Samuel De Champlain Bridge as viewed from Brossard\n| official_name    = \n| other_name       = \n| carries          = 8 lanes (4 northwestbound, 4 southeastbound) of {{jct|province=QC|A|10|A|15|A|20}}\n| crosses          = [[St. Lawrence River]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]\n| locale           = [[Brossard]] and [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada\n| owner            = The Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc.\n| maint            = The Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Inc.\n| id               = \n| website          = https://www.newchamplain.ca/\n| architect        = [[Poul Ove Jensen]]\n| designer         = [[T.Y.

As such she has many of her father's powers relating to magic, typically controlled by speaking the words of her incantations spelled backwards.\n\nShe is known for her involvement with the [[Justice League]], her [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] childhood association with [[Batman]], and her crossing of the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] line with characters such as romantic partner [[John Constantine]].\n\nZatanna made her first live action appearance as a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]].\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Hawkman (comic book)|Hawkman]]'' #4 (November 1964). When she is introduced, she is on a quest to find her father [[Zatara]] who made his first appearance in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] but had not been published regularly for several years. The storyline crossed multiple comics published by DC at the time, culminating in issues of ''[[Justice League of America]]'', also written by Fox.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nZatanna is the daughter of [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]] who appeared in [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic books and Sindella, a member of the mystical ''[[Homo magi]]'' species. Her younger cousin, the teenager [[Zachary Zatara]], is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage [[illusionist]] prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father.

After a brief stay she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures.\n\nWhen the Justice League vanish in the past as they attempt to rescue the missing [[Aquaman]], an emergency protocol set up by Batman assembles a new League, with this team including [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]] as its magical expert. However, when the current threat is identified as [[Gamemnae]], an ancient Atlantean sorceress who seeks to conquer the world, she uses a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When new League leader [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] attempts to order Blood to transform into Etrigan to help them against Gamemnae, Blood insists that Zatanna is the one they need, sacrificing himself to Gamemnae's quagmire spell in order to free Zatanna. She subsequently joins Nightwing, Firestorm and Hawkgirl in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae's power.\n\nIn the 2004 limited series ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] rapes the Elongated Man's wife, [[Sue Dibny]]. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light's memories of the incident as she had done to other villains with knowledge dangerous to the League, tampering with Light's mind sparks a debate among the team's members: should the villain's personality be transformed to prevent him from repeating his crime? Zatanna, Hawkman, and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)]] vote for such action, while [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], and Green Lantern vote against. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] breaks the tie. Zatanna [[mind-wipe]]s Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered.<ref>Cowsill, Alan \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 313: \"The Justice League had...asked Zatanna to erase Light's memory and alter his mind.\"</ref> In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman's memories of the incident as well.\n\nHer working relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[Lazarus Pit]]s, she asks him why he came to her. \"I needed someone I could trust,\" Batman says. \"But I had to settle for you.\" After ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', their relationship appears to have warmed; in ''Detective Comics'' #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]]. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, \"Zee\".\n\n[[Catwoman]] discovers that Zatanna's mind-wipe of Dr. Light in ''Identity Crisis'' is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman's journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are retconned as being the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman covers Zatanna's mouth with a piece of duct tape, gagging her, and shoves her out a window.\n\nA 2005 four-issue ''Zatanna'' limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' event.<ref>Cowsill \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 319: \"Grant Morrison's imagining of the ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' was one of DC's most adventurous titles...The story started in ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' #0 and continued in seven four-issue miniseries \u2013 ''The Bulleteer'', ''Frankenstein'', ''Mister Miracle'', ''Zatanna'', ''Shining Knight'', ''Manhattan Guardian'', and ''Klarion''.\"</ref> In it, at a [[support group]] for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father's tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Misty Kilgore]], she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a [[wiktionary:plague|plague]] to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his \"greatest spell and gift to the world.\" In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.\n\nIn ''Detective Comics'' #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna's father was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne]]. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends although Batman believes that he has never met her in ''Justice League of America'' #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker's scheme. Bruce puts Zatanna's betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.\n\nOn the \"Roll Call\" of ''Justice League of America'' #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with [[Red Tornado]]'s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of [[Amazo]]. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dwayne McDuffie|McDuffie, Dwayne]]|penciller= [[Ed Benes|Benes, Ed]]|inker= Benes, Ed|story= The Second Coming Chapter Two Things Fall Apart|title= Justice League of America|volume= 2|issue= 23|date= September 2008}}</ref> She is silenced again after Amazo uses his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to create a gag for her mouth that she is unable to remove, rendering her useless for much of the fight.

Art by Sami Basri.]]\nZatanna is one of the most powerful sorceresses in the DC universe, whose abilities are apparently [[gene]]tic. As a tribute to her father and as a focal point, she usually casts spells by speaking verbal commands backwards. She has proven capable on many occasions of casting spells by speaking normally, and, in rarer occasions, the ability to use magic for simple tasks without speaking. Like [[Black Canary]], Zatanna's reliance on her voice often leads to her being bound and gagged by villains, a measure that renders her 'powerless'. On very rare occasions, Zatanna has cast spells by writing them in her own blood rather than speaking them aloud. It is used as a last resort, only to heal from severe physical damage preventing her from speaking, like having her [[larynx]] mangled by a bullet, or her mouth magically erased by her own powers. The only magic command issued in both cases, ''Heal me'', had to be spelled backwards, as if she were speaking (''leaH em'').\n\nHer magical powers increase if not used,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matthew Sturges|Sturges, Matthew]]|artist=[[St\u00e9phane Roux (comics)|Roux, St\u00e9phane]]|letterer=Brosseau, Pat|editor=[[Joey Cavalieri]], Chris Conroy|story=SymmetryyrtemmyS|title=[[Zatanna (comic book)|Zatanna]]|volume=2|issue=12|date=June 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location= |page= |panel= |id= }}</ref> but overuse can deplete them to the point that further use strains her physical well-being; as with other magical users, the only way to restore her waning powers is an extended period of rest.\n\nWhile not as adept as [[Madame Xanadu]], Zatanna has proven herself able to call upon [[tarot]] reading for insight or divination.<ref name=\"Detective847\" /> Apparently, such a task does not require verbal incantations, spoken or written, at all, nor is it tied to a specific tarot deck.\n\nThe limits of her powers have never been clearly established.

She considers part of her \"training\" exercising [[sleight of hand]] tricks, and she claims to have invented a variation of the [[three-card monte]] called the \"Zatara shuffle\", in which she is so fast and precise that, even without resorting to cheating, only skilled gamblers like Selina Kyle are able to follow the movements of her hands.\n\nZatanna is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by her father during her childhood.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''DC Super Dictionary''===\nThe 1978 ''DC Super Dictionary'' invented a character, Conjura, who had the same magic ability as Zatanna, in addition to possessing a time-traveling amulet.

Looking for her father's ''Book of Magick'' in England, she meets John Constantine for the first time. They team up to rescue [[Raven (DC Comics)|Rachel Roth]] and retrieve the ''Book of Magick'' from [[Brother Blood]]. Similar to the TV show, her spells are spoken entirely backwards.\n\n===''DC Bombshells''===\nIn the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, Zatanna was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Romani mother during World War II, but was prevented from being sent to the concentration camps thanks to the Joker's Daughter, who in return, forced her to perform magic to aid the Third Reich. Her lover, John Constantine, confronted her during one of her shows in an attempt to rescue her, but knowing they were surrounded, Zatanna transformed John into a rabbit and kept him under her care to prevent his death. He eventually convinces her to use her magic to aid the Allies, which she does by transforming her soul into a large, spiritual dove that aids Batwoman in freeing a refugee camp. Their attempts are discovered by the Nazis, and the two are depowered of their magic (with John being turned back into a human) and sent into the ghettos. Zatanna slowly gains her powers back over time, and finds a kindred spirit in another magic user imprisoned by the Joker's Daughter, Raven. They eventually defeat and depower the Joker's Daughter after allying herself with the Bombshells.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n====Animation====\nZatanna has made multiple appearances in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:\n[[File:Zatanna (Justice League Unlimited).png|96px|thumb|Zatanna as seen on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n** Zatanna first appears in a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode, voiced by [[Julie Brown]]. She is an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (using the alias John Smith) during the years in which Bruce was traveling the globe learning skills from Zatanna's father that later serves well as Batman; in particular, escape artistry. In the episode [[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|\"Zatanna\"]], she visits [[Gotham City]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by criminal magic debunker Montague Kane. Batman helps Zatanna clear her name, and by the end of their confrontation with Kane, she realizes Batman is really \"John Smith\". At the end of the episode, the two promise to keep in touch, as dear friends.\n** Zatanna makes two appearances in the ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' flash animation episodes, voiced by [[Stacie Randall]]. In \"A Little Night Magic\", Zatanna walks home on her own after a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In \"Hold the Tiger\", Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna does not arrest Catwoman but instead asks for help in finding her [[white tiger]].\n** Zatanna made a cameo appearance in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. In the episode \"Out of the Past,\" an elderly Bruce Wayne is looking through a collection of pictures on his computer of past loves, alongside [[Lois Lane]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Barbara Gordon]].\n** Zatanna reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]] (in \"This Little Piggy\") and by [[Juliet Landau]] (in \"The Balance,\" albeit uncredited.) In \"This Little Piggy,\" she helps Batman search for [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] after the villainess turned [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig. Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman's true identity since her last appearance (\"Bruce! I haven't seen you for so long...\") and knows well enough to perceive the Dark Knight's romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. It's revealed that after her encounter with Batman that she somehow came across actual magic power, which she now uses to help people as a crimefighter and secretly uses them at the same time during her magic show tours for public entertainment. Like her comic book counterpart, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, and on one occasion, speaking normally. Zatanna also appeared in \"The Balance\" amongst the magic-based superheroes affected by the disturbance in the magical balance. In \"Destroyer,\" Zatanna appears as one of many [[Justice League]] members called to help fight the invading [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] forces. DCAU writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's appearances described above. In 1998, [[Alan Burnett]] told ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', \"Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he\u2019s secretly in love with her. It\u2019s something we try not to talk about too much.\"\n\n[[File:ZatannaCM.jpg|thumb|Teenage Zatanna in ''Cartoon Monsoon'']]\n* Two episodes of a Cartoon Monsoon contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. This saw her match wits with [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], and featured her father (referred to only as \"Zatara\") as well as the new character of Zatanna's older, non-magic-wielding brother (named \"Damon\" in the second episode.)\n\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', with Jennifer Hale reprising her role. In the teaser of \"Chill of the Night!\", she and Batman stop [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. Though she relies primarily on vocal spells, she is shown to be able to effectively wield Kadabra's magic wand after Abra gags her mouth shut and when she tries to remove it she pulls out a stream of handkerchiefs stuffed in her mouth. Zatanna gets Kadabra's wand and makes the handkerchiefs disappear, then snaps the wand. While Batman holds back the mind control slaves, Zatanna battles Kadabra, and traps Abra in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. This version wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark fishnets replaced by purple tights.\n\n* Zatanna appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' cartoon series,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|title= New ''Young Justice,'' ''Batman: The Brave And The Bold'' October 2011 Episode Details|first= Jim|last= Harvey|date= September 27, 2011|publisher= Worldsfinestonline.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233017/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|archivedate= April 26, 2014|url-status= live|accessdate= April 25, 2014}}</ref> voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]. This version is only thirteen years old, and as such her romantic entanglements involving Batman are instead transferred to Robin. In the episode \"Humanity\", Zatara initially brings Zatanna to Mount Justice in [[Happy Harbor]] to meet the team, and asks the kids give Zatanna a tour of Mount Justice. They pretend to go along with that request, quickly use [[Miss Martian]]'s ship to leave the cave and track down [[Red Tornado]] with Zatanna, referring to her departure with them as \"kidnapping\". Zatara was displeased that his daughter went on a mission with the team. Robin seems to have an interest in her. She returns in the episode \"Secrets\", where she and [[Tigress (DC Comics)#In other media|Artemis]] head to [[Manhattan]] on Halloween night. They are ambushed and eventually kidnapped by [[Harm (comics)|Harm]], a psychotic teenager wielding the mystical sword of [[Beowulf]], who then binds and gags Zatanna. While Harm interrogates Artemis, Zatanna fruitlessly attempts to conjure a spell through her gag. The ghost of Harm's murdered sister, [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]], soon appears and removes the tape from Zatanna's mouth, allowing her to rescue Artemis. Together, the three girls defeat Harm and allow Secret's spirit to move on to the afterlife. Afterwards, Zatanna promises to erect a proper grave for Secret, who had previously been buried in Harm's backyard. In episode \"Misplaced\", Zatanna is with the team when all the adults disappear. She is able to use a spell to locate [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] on Roanoke Island. As her powers seem ineffective against Klarion (he refers to them as \"baby magic\"), she dons the Helmet of Fate as a last-ditch effort. After Klarion escapes, Nabu refuses to relinquish Zatanna as his host, until her father offers himself as Nabu's host. After making Batman promise to take care of her, Zatara dons the helmet and leaves Zatanna with the rest of the team. She then moves into Mount Justice with Miss Martian and Superboy and joins the team full-time. She is shown to be clearly devastated by the loss of her father. In \"Happy New Year\", she and [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]] are now shown as adult members of the Justice League. In the episode \"Depths,\" Nightwing implies a past romantic relationship between them to explain why she was willing to provide him with an enchanted amulet without asking for its purpose. In \"Satisfaction\", Zatanna and Miss Martian attend Rocket's bridal shower, and fight Captain Cold alongside Bumblebee, Black Canary, Wonder Girl, and Batgirl. In the episode \"Cornered\", Zatanna, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and the team battle [[Despero]] in the Hall of Justice. She helps by possessing [[Mal Duncan|Mal]] and backfiring Despero's powers on himself. In \"Intervention\", she assists Rocket in capturing [[Jamie Reyes|Blue Beetle]] and releasing him from the Reach.\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]''. In episode 46, Zatanna is among the superheroes that ask Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \"Super Friends\". In episode 50, Zatanna (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) appears on a skit called \"Potions 11\" where she teams up with [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] for their heist.\n* Zatanna appears only in the intro of the ''[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special]]'' with the Justice League.\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', with Lacey Chabert reprising the role while her child form is voiced by [[Dayci Brookshire]]. In the episode \"Zombie King\", she and [[Swamp Thing]] help Batman fight Solomon Grundy when he raises an army of zombies with a magical gem. In the episode \"Trick or Threat,\" she, Batman, Doctor Fate, and John Constantine are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy so that he can lure them into a trap at the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In the episode \"Speed Demon,\" Zatanna helps Batman defeat Harley Quinn who had been enchanted by Brother Night. During the confrontation with Brother Night, Ember, and the rest of Brother Night's followers, Brother Night enchants the Batmobile where it wraps and gags, Zatanna while separating her from her hat and takes her on a ride causing Batman to enlist Etrigan the Demon for help. After Batman and Etrigan the Demon free Zatanna and have both the enchanted Batmobile and the ice cream truck that was enchanted by [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] teleported to Brother Night's lair, Brother Night and his followers get away as Batman and Zatanna claim the enchanted orb that Brother Night used on the Batmobile that he left behind. In the episode \"Hat Trick,\" Zatanna was helping Batman and Jason Blood fight the possessed mannequins until Felix Faust appears and makes off with her hat. Upon tracing Felix Faust to the [[Hebrides]], Batman, Zatanna, and Etrigan the Demon are transported there by Merlin. Once there, they find that Felix Faust is using Zatanna's hat to summon the demon [[Demons Three|Ghast]] on the world as a way to regain his youth. Once that was done, Zatanna engages Felix Faust in battle while Batman and Etrigan the Demon work to prevent Ghast from reaching the mainland. As Felix Faust animates a gargoyle, Zatanna uses every trick in her arsenal where she destroys the gargoyle and chains Felix Faust up with the chains she conjured. Once Zatanna regains her hat, she casts a spell to send Ghast back to where he came from.\n* Zatanna appears in the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' TV series, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. In this series, she's a teenager at Metropolis High, has purple hair and is both a dramatic fashionista (providing [[Wonder Woman]] with her alter ego as Greek exchange student, Diana Prince) and an entertainer for birthday parties. While Zatanna's personality is based on her ''Young Justice'' counterpart, she is not a rebel type but still loves her father.\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]''. In \"So You Need A Crew?\", she appears in a flashback where she helps the Justice League defeat the [[Queen of Fables]] by sealing her in a U.S. Master Tax Guide Book. In \"The Line\", a court order forces her to release Queen of Fables from the book.\n\n====Live-action====\n[[File:Serinda Swan as Zatanna Zatara.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Serinda Swan]] as Zatanna Zatara in ''Smallville''.]]\nZatanna is a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]], marking her first appearance in live-action. The character first appeared late in [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]], in the episode \"Hex\". She is described as the daughter of the deceased [[John Zatara]], \"the world's greatest magician\". Zatanna is introduced at the Ace of Clubs, the scene of [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]])'s birthday party. To enliven things, Zatanna uses magic to make characters' inner desires come true\u2014Chloe is physically transformed to resemble her cousin, [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), for example, and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] ([[Tom Welling]]) becomes \"normal\". Zatanna later approaches [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) and offers him a deal: she will grant him a wish if he returns her father's magical book to her. Once she acquires the Book of Zatara from Green Arrow, whom she recognizes as Oliver, she reveals her aim is to use it to resurrect her father. Because Clark is vulnerable to magic, and Oliver lacks the power to stop her, Zatanna has to realize for herself that her father sacrificed himself so she could live. She later goes to Oliver to explain herself, and decides to help him if he encounters any supernatural foes along the way by leaving him her phone number. Swan reprises the role in the [[Smallville (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''Smallville'' in the episode titled \"Warrior\". In [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]] episodes which feature the government attempting to hunt down the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], Zatanna's picture is shown among their targets. Although not portrayed by Swan, an actor in costume represents Zatanna in the episode \"Icarus\". In the episode \"Fortune\", Zatanna is used as a plot device; the episode establishes her as having sent an enchanted bottle of wine to Clark and Lois on the night of their engagement party, which sets the events of that episode in motion.\n\n===Film===\n====Live action====\n* In 2005, screenwriter Hadley Davis (''[[Ice Princess]]'') announced that she had written an action-comedy featuring a teenaged version of Zatanna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Davis Conjures Zatanna|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&id=30663|work=Sci Fi Wire|publisher=[[Syfy|Sci Fi]]|accessdate= April 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031214705/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&id=30663|archivedate=October 31, 2005|date=March 23, 2005}}</ref> Nothing further was ever heard about this project, and it is presumed to have been abandoned.\n* Zatanna is one of the main characters for the film ''Justice League Dark'' (based on the [[Justice League Dark|superhero team of the same name]]), part of [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://screenrant.com/justice-league-dark-movie-dc-shared-universe/|title= Guillermo del Toro: ''Justice League Dark'' is Part of DC\u2019s Shared Movie Universe|first= Ben|last= Kendrick|date= December 3, 2014|publisher= Screen Rant|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906022604/http://screenrant.com/justice-league-dark-movie-dc-shared-universe/|archivedate= September 6, 2015|url-status= live|quote= Guillermo del Toro: 'Right now the only sort of shared universe project I\u2019m working on is ''Dark Universe'' for Warners, you know, for DC, which is Swamp Thing, Demon, Deadman, Zatanna.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/28/guillermo-del-toro-gives-justice-league-darkdark-universe-script-to-warner-bros|title= Guillermo del Toro Gives ''Justice League Dark''/''Dark Universe'' Script to Warner Bros.|first= Anthony|last= Couto|date= November 28, 2014|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150109152940/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/28/guillermo-del-toro-gives-justice-league-darkdark-universe-script-to-warner-bros|archivedate= January 9, 2015|url-status= live|quote= The basis for ''Dark Universe'' \u2013 the comic book series ''Justice League Dark'' \u2013 features supernatural characters from the DC lore, including Zatanna, Deadman, Frankenstein, Swamp Thing, and notably, John Constantine.}}</ref> \n\n*Deadline announced that a Zatanna movie is in development by Warner and DC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/spider-women-captain-marvel-and-harley-quinn-females-fly-in-the-face-of-old-hollywood-perceptions-1202485612/|title=Spider-Women, Captain Marvel & Harley Quinn: Females Fly In The Face Of Old Hollywood Perceptions|publisher=Deadline|date=November 30, 2018|accessdate=November 30, 2018|author=Geoff Boucher}}</ref>\n*In 2019, rumours began spreading about Zatanna appearing in [[James Gunn]]'s ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', the sequel to [[David Ayer]]'s ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', however Gunn debunked the rumour saying he \"never considered Zatanna being in the film [The Suicide Squad]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-2-zatanna-rumors-debunked-james-gunn/amp/|title=James Gunn Never Even Considered Zatanna For Suicide Squad 2|website=Screenrant|date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* An alternate version of Zatanna makes a brief cameo appearance in ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]].\n* A character with a design based on the ''Young Justice'' version of Zatanna, along with [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]], [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], and [[Miss Martian]], makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in ''[[Scooby-Doo!

As such she has many of her father's powers relating to magic, typically controlled by speaking the words of her incantations spelled backwards.\n\nShe is known for her involvement with the [[Justice League]], her [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] childhood association with [[Batman]], and her crossing of the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] line with characters such as romantic partner [[John Constantine]].\n\nZatanna made her first live action appearance as a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]].\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Hawkman (comic book)|Hawkman]]'' #4 (November 1964). When she is introduced, she is on a quest to find her father [[Zatara]] who made his first appearance in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] but had not been published regularly for several years. The storyline crossed multiple comics published by DC at the time, culminating in issues of ''[[Justice League of America]]'', also written by Fox.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nZatanna is the daughter of [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]] who appeared in [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic books and Sindella, a member of the mystical ''[[Homo magi]]'' species. Her younger cousin, the teenager [[Zachary Zatara]], is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage [[illusionist]] prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Her original costume is based upon her father's costume but substituting [[fishnet]] [[Hosiery|stockings]] and [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] for slacks.

After a brief stay she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures.\n\nWhen the Justice League vanish in the past as they attempt to rescue the missing [[Aquaman]], an emergency protocol set up by Batman assembles a new League, with this team including [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]] as its magical expert. However, when the current threat is identified as [[Gamemnae]], an ancient Atlantean sorceress who seeks to conquer the world, she uses a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When new League leader [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] attempts to order Blood to transform into Etrigan to help them against Gamemnae, Blood insists that Zatanna is the one they need, sacrificing himself to Gamemnae's quagmire spell in order to free Zatanna. She subsequently joins Nightwing, Firestorm and Hawkgirl in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae's power.\n\nIn the 2004 limited series ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] rapes the Elongated Man's wife, [[Sue Dibny]]. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light's memories of the incident as she had done to other villains with knowledge dangerous to the League, tampering with Light's mind sparks a debate among the team's members: should the villain's personality be transformed to prevent him from repeating his crime? Zatanna, Hawkman, and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)]] vote for such action, while [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], and Green Lantern vote against. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] breaks the tie. Zatanna [[mind-wipe]]s Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered.<ref>Cowsill, Alan \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 313: \"The Justice League had...asked Zatanna to erase Light's memory and alter his mind.\"</ref> In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman's memories of the incident as well.\n\nHer working relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[Lazarus Pit]]s, she asks him why he came to her. \"I needed someone I could trust,\" Batman says. \"But I had to settle for you.\" After ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', their relationship appears to have warmed; in ''Detective Comics'' #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]]. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, \"Zee\".\n\n[[Catwoman]] discovers that Zatanna's mind-wipe of Dr. Light in ''Identity Crisis'' is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman's journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are retconned as being the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman covers Zatanna's mouth with a piece of duct tape, gagging her, and shoves her out a window.\n\nA 2005 four-issue ''Zatanna'' limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' event.<ref>Cowsill \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 319: \"Grant Morrison's imagining of the ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' was one of DC's most adventurous titles...The story started in ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' #0 and continued in seven four-issue miniseries \u2013 ''The Bulleteer'', ''Frankenstein'', ''Mister Miracle'', ''Zatanna'', ''Shining Knight'', ''Manhattan Guardian'', and ''Klarion''.\"</ref> In it, at a [[support group]] for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father's tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Misty Kilgore]], she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a [[wiktionary:plague|plague]] to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his \"greatest spell and gift to the world.\" In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.\n\nIn ''Detective Comics'' #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna's father was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne]]. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends although Batman believes that he has never met her in ''Justice League of America'' #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker's scheme. Bruce puts Zatanna's betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.\n\nOn the \"Roll Call\" of ''Justice League of America'' #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with [[Red Tornado]]'s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of [[Amazo]]. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dwayne McDuffie|McDuffie, Dwayne]]|penciller= [[Ed Benes|Benes, Ed]]|inker= Benes, Ed|story= The Second Coming Chapter Two Things Fall Apart|title= Justice League of America|volume= 2|issue= 23|date= September 2008}}</ref> She is silenced again after Amazo uses his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to create a gag for her mouth that she is unable to remove, rendering her useless for much of the fight.

Art by Sami Basri.]]\nZatanna is one of the most powerful sorceresses in the DC universe, whose abilities are apparently [[gene]]tic. As a tribute to her father and as a focal point, she usually casts spells by speaking verbal commands backwards. She has proven capable on many occasions of casting spells by speaking normally, and, in rarer occasions, the ability to use magic for simple tasks without speaking. Like [[Black Canary]], Zatanna's reliance on her voice often leads to her being bound and gagged by villains, a measure that renders her 'powerless'. On very rare occasions, Zatanna has cast spells by writing them in her own blood rather than speaking them aloud. It is used as a last resort, only to heal from severe physical damage preventing her from speaking, like having her [[larynx]] mangled by a bullet, or her mouth magically erased by her own powers. The only magic command issued in both cases, ''Heal me'', had to be spelled backwards, as if she were speaking (''leaH em'').\n\nHer magical powers increase if not used,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matthew Sturges|Sturges, Matthew]]|artist=[[St\u00e9phane Roux (comics)|Roux, St\u00e9phane]]|letterer=Brosseau, Pat|editor=[[Joey Cavalieri]], Chris Conroy|story=SymmetryyrtemmyS|title=[[Zatanna (comic book)|Zatanna]]|volume=2|issue=12|date=June 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location= |page= |panel= |id= }}</ref> but overuse can deplete them to the point that further use strains her physical well-being; as with other magical users, the only way to restore her waning powers is an extended period of rest.\n\nWhile not as adept as [[Madame Xanadu]], Zatanna has proven herself able to call upon [[tarot]] reading for insight or divination.<ref name=\"Detective847\" /> Apparently, such a task does not require verbal incantations, spoken or written, at all, nor is it tied to a specific tarot deck.\n\nThe limits of her powers have never been clearly established. She is often depicted working alongside the most powerful magic-users on Earth, including [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], [[Madame Xanadu]], [[John Constantine]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Doctor Fate]], while on another occasion Jason Blood sacrificed himself to free Zatanna from a trap as he felt that she was better qualified to face the current threat than he was. She has used her powers to command elemental forces, heal, transmute and transmogrify objects, manipulate minds, and attack her opponents with [[energy]] blasts.

During a portion of her initial tenure with the Justice League, her powers were more limited, consisting in the manipulation of [[Classical element|fire, air, water, and earth.]] Furthermore, her powers seems tied to her self-confidence, as the long series of blunders described in ''Seven Soldiers'' left her both emotionally and psychologically shattered, powerless, until she was able to restore her lost confidence.\n\nZatanna is a skilled illusionist, showgirl and stage magician even without resorting to her innate magical powers. She considers part of her \"training\" exercising [[sleight of hand]] tricks, and she claims to have invented a variation of the [[three-card monte]] called the \"Zatara shuffle\", in which she is so fast and precise that, even without resorting to cheating, only skilled gamblers like Selina Kyle are able to follow the movements of her hands.\n\nZatanna is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by her father during her childhood.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''DC Super Dictionary''===\nThe 1978 ''DC Super Dictionary'' invented a character, Conjura, who had the same magic ability as Zatanna, in addition to possessing a time-traveling amulet.

Looking for her father's ''Book of Magick'' in England, she meets John Constantine for the first time. They team up to rescue [[Raven (DC Comics)|Rachel Roth]] and retrieve the ''Book of Magick'' from [[Brother Blood]]. Similar to the TV show, her spells are spoken entirely backwards.\n\n===''DC Bombshells''===\nIn the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, Zatanna was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Romani mother during World War II, but was prevented from being sent to the concentration camps thanks to the Joker's Daughter, who in return, forced her to perform magic to aid the Third Reich. Her lover, John Constantine, confronted her during one of her shows in an attempt to rescue her, but knowing they were surrounded, Zatanna transformed John into a rabbit and kept him under her care to prevent his death. He eventually convinces her to use her magic to aid the Allies, which she does by transforming her soul into a large, spiritual dove that aids Batwoman in freeing a refugee camp. Their attempts are discovered by the Nazis, and the two are depowered of their magic (with John being turned back into a human) and sent into the ghettos. Zatanna slowly gains her powers back over time, and finds a kindred spirit in another magic user imprisoned by the Joker's Daughter, Raven. They eventually defeat and depower the Joker's Daughter after allying herself with the Bombshells.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n====Animation====\nZatanna has made multiple appearances in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:\n[[File:Zatanna (Justice League Unlimited).png|96px|thumb|Zatanna as seen on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n** Zatanna first appears in a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode, voiced by [[Julie Brown]]. She is an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (using the alias John Smith) during the years in which Bruce was traveling the globe learning skills from Zatanna's father that later serves well as Batman; in particular, escape artistry. In the episode [[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|\"Zatanna\"]], she visits [[Gotham City]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by criminal magic debunker Montague Kane. Batman helps Zatanna clear her name, and by the end of their confrontation with Kane, she realizes Batman is really \"John Smith\". At the end of the episode, the two promise to keep in touch, as dear friends.\n** Zatanna makes two appearances in the ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' flash animation episodes, voiced by [[Stacie Randall]]. In \"A Little Night Magic\", Zatanna walks home on her own after a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In \"Hold the Tiger\", Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna does not arrest Catwoman but instead asks for help in finding her [[white tiger]].\n** Zatanna made a cameo appearance in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. In the episode \"Out of the Past,\" an elderly Bruce Wayne is looking through a collection of pictures on his computer of past loves, alongside [[Lois Lane]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Barbara Gordon]].\n** Zatanna reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]] (in \"This Little Piggy\") and by [[Juliet Landau]] (in \"The Balance,\" albeit uncredited.) In \"This Little Piggy,\" she helps Batman search for [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] after the villainess turned [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig. Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman's true identity since her last appearance (\"Bruce! I haven't seen you for so long...\") and knows well enough to perceive the Dark Knight's romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. It's revealed that after her encounter with Batman that she somehow came across actual magic power, which she now uses to help people as a crimefighter and secretly uses them at the same time during her magic show tours for public entertainment. Like her comic book counterpart, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, and on one occasion, speaking normally. Zatanna also appeared in \"The Balance\" amongst the magic-based superheroes affected by the disturbance in the magical balance. In \"Destroyer,\" Zatanna appears as one of many [[Justice League]] members called to help fight the invading [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] forces. DCAU writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's appearances described above. In 1998, [[Alan Burnett]] told ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', \"Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he\u2019s secretly in love with her. It\u2019s something we try not to talk about too much.\"\n\n[[File:ZatannaCM.jpg|thumb|Teenage Zatanna in ''Cartoon Monsoon'']]\n* Two episodes of a Cartoon Monsoon contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. This saw her match wits with [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], and featured her father (referred to only as \"Zatara\") as well as the new character of Zatanna's older, non-magic-wielding brother (named \"Damon\" in the second episode.)\n\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', with Jennifer Hale reprising her role. In the teaser of \"Chill of the Night!\", she and Batman stop [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. Though she relies primarily on vocal spells, she is shown to be able to effectively wield Kadabra's magic wand after Abra gags her mouth shut and when she tries to remove it she pulls out a stream of handkerchiefs stuffed in her mouth. Zatanna gets Kadabra's wand and makes the handkerchiefs disappear, then snaps the wand. While Batman holds back the mind control slaves, Zatanna battles Kadabra, and traps Abra in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. This version wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark fishnets replaced by purple tights.\n\n* Zatanna appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' cartoon series,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|title= New ''Young Justice,'' ''Batman: The Brave And The Bold'' October 2011 Episode Details|first= Jim|last= Harvey|date= September 27, 2011|publisher= Worldsfinestonline.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233017/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|archivedate= April 26, 2014|url-status= live|accessdate= April 25, 2014}}</ref> voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]. This version is only thirteen years old, and as such her romantic entanglements involving Batman are instead transferred to Robin. In the episode \"Humanity\", Zatara initially brings Zatanna to Mount Justice in [[Happy Harbor]] to meet the team, and asks the kids give Zatanna a tour of Mount Justice. They pretend to go along with that request, quickly use [[Miss Martian]]'s ship to leave the cave and track down [[Red Tornado]] with Zatanna, referring to her departure with them as \"kidnapping\". Zatara was displeased that his daughter went on a mission with the team. Robin seems to have an interest in her. She returns in the episode \"Secrets\", where she and [[Tigress (DC Comics)#In other media|Artemis]] head to [[Manhattan]] on Halloween night. They are ambushed and eventually kidnapped by [[Harm (comics)|Harm]], a psychotic teenager wielding the mystical sword of [[Beowulf]], who then binds and gags Zatanna. While Harm interrogates Artemis, Zatanna fruitlessly attempts to conjure a spell through her gag. The ghost of Harm's murdered sister, [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]], soon appears and removes the tape from Zatanna's mouth, allowing her to rescue Artemis. Together, the three girls defeat Harm and allow Secret's spirit to move on to the afterlife. Afterwards, Zatanna promises to erect a proper grave for Secret, who had previously been buried in Harm's backyard. In episode \"Misplaced\", Zatanna is with the team when all the adults disappear. She is able to use a spell to locate [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] on Roanoke Island. As her powers seem ineffective against Klarion (he refers to them as \"baby magic\"), she dons the Helmet of Fate as a last-ditch effort. After Klarion escapes, Nabu refuses to relinquish Zatanna as his host, until her father offers himself as Nabu's host. After making Batman promise to take care of her, Zatara dons the helmet and leaves Zatanna with the rest of the team. She then moves into Mount Justice with Miss Martian and Superboy and joins the team full-time. She is shown to be clearly devastated by the loss of her father. In \"Happy New Year\", she and [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]] are now shown as adult members of the Justice League. In the episode \"Depths,\" Nightwing implies a past romantic relationship between them to explain why she was willing to provide him with an enchanted amulet without asking for its purpose. In \"Satisfaction\", Zatanna and Miss Martian attend Rocket's bridal shower, and fight Captain Cold alongside Bumblebee, Black Canary, Wonder Girl, and Batgirl. In the episode \"Cornered\", Zatanna, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and the team battle [[Despero]] in the Hall of Justice. She helps by possessing [[Mal Duncan|Mal]] and backfiring Despero's powers on himself. In \"Intervention\", she assists Rocket in capturing [[Jamie Reyes|Blue Beetle]] and releasing him from the Reach.\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]''. In episode 46, Zatanna is among the superheroes that ask Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \"Super Friends\". In episode 50, Zatanna (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) appears on a skit called \"Potions 11\" where she teams up with [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] for their heist.\n* Zatanna appears only in the intro of the ''[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special]]'' with the Justice League.\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', with Lacey Chabert reprising the role while her child form is voiced by [[Dayci Brookshire]]. In the episode \"Zombie King\", she and [[Swamp Thing]] help Batman fight Solomon Grundy when he raises an army of zombies with a magical gem. In the episode \"Trick or Threat,\" she, Batman, Doctor Fate, and John Constantine are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy so that he can lure them into a trap at the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In the episode \"Speed Demon,\" Zatanna helps Batman defeat Harley Quinn who had been enchanted by Brother Night. During the confrontation with Brother Night, Ember, and the rest of Brother Night's followers, Brother Night enchants the Batmobile where it wraps and gags, Zatanna while separating her from her hat and takes her on a ride causing Batman to enlist Etrigan the Demon for help. After Batman and Etrigan the Demon free Zatanna and have both the enchanted Batmobile and the ice cream truck that was enchanted by [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] teleported to Brother Night's lair, Brother Night and his followers get away as Batman and Zatanna claim the enchanted orb that Brother Night used on the Batmobile that he left behind. In the episode \"Hat Trick,\" Zatanna was helping Batman and Jason Blood fight the possessed mannequins until Felix Faust appears and makes off with her hat. Upon tracing Felix Faust to the [[Hebrides]], Batman, Zatanna, and Etrigan the Demon are transported there by Merlin. Once there, they find that Felix Faust is using Zatanna's hat to summon the demon [[Demons Three|Ghast]] on the world as a way to regain his youth. Once that was done, Zatanna engages Felix Faust in battle while Batman and Etrigan the Demon work to prevent Ghast from reaching the mainland. As Felix Faust animates a gargoyle, Zatanna uses every trick in her arsenal where she destroys the gargoyle and chains Felix Faust up with the chains she conjured. Once Zatanna regains her hat, she casts a spell to send Ghast back to where he came from.\n* Zatanna appears in the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' TV series, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. In this series, she's a teenager at Metropolis High, has purple hair and is both a dramatic fashionista (providing [[Wonder Woman]] with her alter ego as Greek exchange student, Diana Prince) and an entertainer for birthday parties. While Zatanna's personality is based on her ''Young Justice'' counterpart, she is not a rebel type but still loves her father.\n* Zatanna appears in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]''. In \"So You Need A Crew?\", she appears in a flashback where she helps the Justice League defeat the [[Queen of Fables]] by sealing her in a U.S. Master Tax Guide Book. In \"The Line\", a court order forces her to release Queen of Fables from the book.\n\n====Live-action====\n[[File:Serinda Swan as Zatanna Zatara.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Serinda Swan]] as Zatanna Zatara in ''Smallville''.]]\nZatanna is a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]], marking her first appearance in live-action. The character first appeared late in [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]], in the episode \"Hex\". She is described as the daughter of the deceased [[John Zatara]], \"the world's greatest magician\". Zatanna is introduced at the Ace of Clubs, the scene of [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]])'s birthday party. To enliven things, Zatanna uses magic to make characters' inner desires come true\u2014Chloe is physically transformed to resemble her cousin, [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), for example, and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] ([[Tom Welling]]) becomes \"normal\". Zatanna later approaches [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) and offers him a deal: she will grant him a wish if he returns her father's magical book to her. Once she acquires the Book of Zatara from Green Arrow, whom she recognizes as Oliver, she reveals her aim is to use it to resurrect her father. Because Clark is vulnerable to magic, and Oliver lacks the power to stop her, Zatanna has to realize for herself that her father sacrificed himself so she could live. She later goes to Oliver to explain herself, and decides to help him if he encounters any supernatural foes along the way by leaving him her phone number. Swan reprises the role in the [[Smallville (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''Smallville'' in the episode titled \"Warrior\". In [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]] episodes which feature the government attempting to hunt down the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], Zatanna's picture is shown among their targets. Although not portrayed by Swan, an actor in costume represents Zatanna in the episode \"Icarus\". In the episode \"Fortune\", Zatanna is used as a plot device; the episode establishes her as having sent an enchanted bottle of wine to Clark and Lois on the night of their engagement party, which sets the events of that episode in motion.\n\n===Film===\n====Live action====\n* In 2005, screenwriter Hadley Davis (''[[Ice Princess]]'') announced that she had written an action-comedy featuring a teenaged version of Zatanna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Davis Conjures Zatanna|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&id=30663|work=Sci Fi Wire|publisher=[[Syfy|Sci Fi]]|accessdate= April 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031214705/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&id=30663|archivedate=October 31, 2005|date=March 23, 2005}}</ref> Nothing further was ever heard about this project, and it is presumed to have been abandoned.\n* Zatanna is one of the main characters for the film ''Justice League Dark'' (based on the [[Justice League Dark|superhero team of the same name]]), part of [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://screenrant.com/justice-league-dark-movie-dc-shared-universe/|title= Guillermo del Toro: ''Justice League Dark'' is Part of DC\u2019s Shared Movie Universe|first= Ben|last= Kendrick|date= December 3, 2014|publisher= Screen Rant|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906022604/http://screenrant.com/justice-league-dark-movie-dc-shared-universe/|archivedate= September 6, 2015|url-status= live|quote= Guillermo del Toro: 'Right now the only sort of shared universe project I\u2019m working on is ''Dark Universe'' for Warners, you know, for DC, which is Swamp Thing, Demon, Deadman, Zatanna.'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/28/guillermo-del-toro-gives-justice-league-darkdark-universe-script-to-warner-bros|title= Guillermo del Toro Gives ''Justice League Dark''/''Dark Universe'' Script to Warner Bros.|first= Anthony|last= Couto|date= November 28, 2014|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150109152940/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/28/guillermo-del-toro-gives-justice-league-darkdark-universe-script-to-warner-bros|archivedate= January 9, 2015|url-status= live|quote= The basis for ''Dark Universe'' \u2013 the comic book series ''Justice League Dark'' \u2013 features supernatural characters from the DC lore, including Zatanna, Deadman, Frankenstein, Swamp Thing, and notably, John Constantine.}}</ref> \n\n*Deadline announced that a Zatanna movie is in development by Warner and DC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/spider-women-captain-marvel-and-harley-quinn-females-fly-in-the-face-of-old-hollywood-perceptions-1202485612/|title=Spider-Women, Captain Marvel & Harley Quinn: Females Fly In The Face Of Old Hollywood Perceptions|publisher=Deadline|date=November 30, 2018|accessdate=November 30, 2018|author=Geoff Boucher}}</ref>\n*In 2019, rumours began spreading about Zatanna appearing in [[James Gunn]]'s ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', the sequel to [[David Ayer]]'s ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', however Gunn debunked the rumour saying he \"never considered Zatanna being in the film [The Suicide Squad]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-2-zatanna-rumors-debunked-james-gunn/amp/|title=James Gunn Never Even Considered Zatanna For Suicide Squad 2|website=Screenrant|date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* An alternate version of Zatanna makes a brief cameo appearance in ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]].\n* A character with a design based on the ''Young Justice'' version of Zatanna, along with [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]], [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], and [[Miss Martian]], makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in ''[[Scooby-Doo!

Palpatine is rescued by Anakin and Obi-Wan, but not before the Jedi confront Dooku again. A duel ensues in which Anakin kills the disarmed and helpless Dooku in cold blood at Palpatine's urging. Palpatine then escapes with his rescuers and returns to Coruscant. By this point, Palpatine has become a virtual dictator, able to take any action in the Senate. He makes Anakin his personal representative on the [[Jedi Council]], whose other members deny Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and order him to spy on the Chancellor. Palpatine tells Anakin the story of [[Darth Plagueis]], a powerful Sith Lord who was able to manipulate life and death but was killed by his own apprentice. Eventually, Palpatine reveals his secret Sith identity to Anakin; he knows that Anakin has been having prophetic visions of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth, and offers to teach him Plagueis' secrets to save Padm\u00e9's life.\n\nAnakin informs Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] ([[Samuel L.

With three other Jedi masters at his side, Windu attempts to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at the Jedi Master, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's face into the gray, wizened visage first seen in the original trilogy.

Shortly after protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]] (voiced by [[Taylor Gray]]) reaches through time and space to rescue Ahsoka from Vader, Palpatine sets up a portal that shows [[Kanan Jarrus]]' (voiced by [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) final moments. While Ezra wants to reach through the portal and rescue Kanan, Ahsoka convinces him not to. Palpatine then reveals himself through the portal and shoots Ezra with Force lightning. However, Ahsoka and Ezra manage to evade him and go their separate ways, thus denying Palpatine full power.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Star Wars Rebels]] [[List of Star Wars Rebels episodes#Season 4 (2017\u201318)|Season 4]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]]|date=2017}}</ref>\n\nPalpatine later returns in the [[series finale]] \"Family Reunion - and Farewell\". In the episode, Ezra, having surrendered himself to [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] (voiced by [[Lars Mikkelsen]]) to protect Lothal, is taken by him to a room containing a reconstructed section of the ruined Jedi Temple and a hologram of Palpatine as he appears in the prequel films. Palpatine, having acknowledged the threat Ezra poses to the Empire, presents himself as a kindly figure and shows Ezra a vision of his dead parents through a doorway, promising that the youth will be with them if he enters it. Ezra is initially mesmerized by Palpatine's promise and goes to enter the door, but finally resists and destroys the reconstructed Jedi Temple and the illusion. Palpatine's hologram emerges from the rubble, flickering to show his true self, and commands his Royal Guards to kill Ezra, though Ezra manages to defeat them and escape.

The name would not be used in film until the prequel trilogy, and the first mention of the name Palpatine came from the prologue of Alan Dean Foster's 1976 novelization of ''A New Hope'', which detailed the Emperor's rise to power.

That would be obvious.\" However, \"I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ...

He noted, \"[Palpatine] is a supreme actor.

He explained that \"when you're playing a character of solid blackness, that in itself is very interesting, in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power.\" He admitted, \"I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the [[opera]].\"<ref name=\"HB137\">\"Palpatine's Point of View,\" in ''Homing Beacon'' 137, May 26, 2005, [http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon137.html StarWars.com]; last accessed August 17, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112122104/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon137.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}</ref> McDiarmid compared the character to [[Iago]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'':\n\n{{quote|Everything he does is an act of pure hypocrisy, and that's interesting to play.

But at the same time there's a tremendous evil [[subconscious]] in operation.<ref name=\"ManofMystery\"/>}}\n\nMcDiarmid noticed that the script for ''Revenge of the Sith'' demanded more action from his character than in previous films.

Palpatine is rescued by Anakin and Obi-Wan, but not before the Jedi confront Dooku again. A duel ensues in which Anakin kills the disarmed and helpless Dooku in cold blood at Palpatine's urging. Palpatine then escapes with his rescuers and returns to Coruscant. By this point, Palpatine has become a virtual dictator, able to take any action in the Senate. He makes Anakin his personal representative on the [[Jedi Council]], whose other members deny Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and order him to spy on the Chancellor.

With three other Jedi masters at his side, Windu attempts to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at the Jedi Master, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's face into the gray, wizened visage first seen in the original trilogy.

Shortly after protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]] (voiced by [[Taylor Gray]]) reaches through time and space to rescue Ahsoka from Vader, Palpatine sets up a portal that shows [[Kanan Jarrus]]' (voiced by [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) final moments. While Ezra wants to reach through the portal and rescue Kanan, Ahsoka convinces him not to. Palpatine then reveals himself through the portal and shoots Ezra with Force lightning. However, Ahsoka and Ezra manage to evade him and go their separate ways, thus denying Palpatine full power.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Star Wars Rebels]] [[List of Star Wars Rebels episodes#Season 4 (2017\u201318)|Season 4]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]]|date=2017}}</ref>\n\nPalpatine later returns in the [[series finale]] \"Family Reunion - and Farewell\". In the episode, Ezra, having surrendered himself to [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] (voiced by [[Lars Mikkelsen]]) to protect Lothal, is taken by him to a room containing a reconstructed section of the ruined Jedi Temple and a hologram of Palpatine as he appears in the prequel films. Palpatine, having acknowledged the threat Ezra poses to the Empire, presents himself as a kindly figure and shows Ezra a vision of his dead parents through a doorway, promising that the youth will be with them if he enters it. Ezra is initially mesmerized by Palpatine's promise and goes to enter the door, but finally resists and destroys the reconstructed Jedi Temple and the illusion. Palpatine's hologram emerges from the rubble, flickering to show his true self, and commands his Royal Guards to kill Ezra, though Ezra manages to defeat them and escape.

The name would not be used in film until the prequel trilogy, and the first mention of the name Palpatine came from the prologue of Alan Dean Foster's 1976 novelization of ''A New Hope'', which detailed the Emperor's rise to power.

He explained that \"when you're playing a character of solid blackness, that in itself is very interesting, in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power.\" He admitted, \"I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the [[opera]].\"<ref name=\"HB137\">\"Palpatine's Point of View,\" in ''Homing Beacon'' 137, May 26, 2005, [http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon137.html StarWars.com]; last accessed August 17, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112122104/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon137.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}</ref> McDiarmid compared the character to [[Iago]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'':\n\n{{quote|Everything he does is an act of pure hypocrisy, and that's interesting to play.

But at the same time there's a tremendous evil [[subconscious]] in operation.<ref name=\"ManofMystery\"/>}}\n\nMcDiarmid noticed that the script for ''Revenge of the Sith'' demanded more action from his character than in previous films. Lightsaber combat was a challenge to the 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took [[fencing]] lessons.

HAT-P-32b was first recognized as a possible planet by the planet-searching [[HATNet Project]] in 2004, although difficulties in measuring its [[radial velocity]] prevented astronomers from verifying the planet until after three years of observation. The [[Blendanal]] program helped to rule out most of the alternatives that could explain what HAT-P-32b was, leading astronomers to determine that HAT-P-32b was most likely a planet. The discovery of HAT-P-32b and of [[HAT-P-33b]] was submitted to a journal on 6 June 2011.\n\nThe planet is considered a [[Hot Jupiter]], and although it is slightly less massive than Jupiter, it is bloated to nearly twice Jupiter's size. At the time of its discovery, HAT-P-32b had [[List of largest exoplanets|one of the largest radii known]] amongst extrasolar planets. This phenomenon, which has also been observed in planets like [[WASP-17b]] and [[HAT-P-33b]], has shown that something more than temperature is influencing why these planets become so large.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\n==Discovery==\nIt had been suggested that a planet was in the orbit of the star HAT-P-32 as early as 2004; these observations were collected by the six-telescope [[HATNet Project]], an organization in search of [[transit method|transiting]] planets, or planets that cross in front of their host stars as seen from Earth. However, attempts to confirm the planetary candidate were extremely difficult because of a high level of [[jitter]] (a random, shaky deviation in the measurements of HAT-P-32's [[radial velocity]]) present in the star's observations. High-level jitter prevented the most common technique, that of bisector analysis, from revealing the star's radial velocity with enough certainty to confirm the planet's existence.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nThe [[spectrum]] of HAT-P-32 was collected using the [[digital speedometer]] on Arizona's [[Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory]] (FLWO). Analysis of the data found that HAT-P-32 was a single, moderately rotating [[dwarf star]]. Some of its parameters were also derived, including its [[effective temperature]] and [[surface gravity]].<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nBetween August 2007 and December 2010, twenty-eight spectra were collected using the [[High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer]] (HIRES) at the [[W.M. Keck Observatory]] in Hawaii. Twenty-five of these spectra were used to deduce HAT-P-32's radial velocity. To compensate for jitter, a greater number of spectra than that the usual for planetary candidates was collected. From this, it was concluded that stellar activity (and not the presence of yet-undiscovered planets) was the cause of the jitter.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nBecause astronomers concluded that the use of radial velocity could not, alone, establish the existence of planet HAT-P-32b, the [[KeplerCam CCD]] instrument on FLWO's 1.2m telescope was used to take [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations of HAT-P-32. The data collected using KeplerCam CCD helped astronomers constructed HAT-P-32's [[light curve]]. The light curve displayed a slight dimming at a point where HAT-P-32b was believed to transit its star.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nThe astronomers utilized [[Blendanal]], a program used to eliminate the possibilities of [[false positive]]s. This process serves a similar purpose to the [[Blender (technique)|Blender]] technique, which was used to verify some planets discovered by the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] spacecraft. In doing so, HAT-P-32's planet-like signature was found to not be caused by either a [[multiple star#Hierarchical systems|hierarchical triple star system]] or by a mixture of light between a bright single star and that of a [[binary star]] in the background. Although the possibility that HAT-P-32 is actually a binary star with a dim secondary companion nearly indistinguishable from the primary companion could not be ruled out, HAT-P-32b was confirmed as a planet based on the Blendanal analysis.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nBecause of the high jitter of the star, the best way to collect more data on HAT-P-32b would be to observe an [[occultation]] of HAT-P-32b behind its star using the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nHAT-P-32b's discovery was reported with that of HAT-P-33b in the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]''.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\n==Host star==\nHAT-P-32, or GSC 3281\u201300800, is a double star; the primary is a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G-type]] or [[Stellar classification#Class F|F-type]] [[dwarf star]],<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> and the secondary is a [[Stellar classification#Class M|M-type]] [[dwarf star]].<ref name=Zhao2014/> The system is located {{convert|292|pc|ly}} away from Earth.<ref name=\"Gaia\"/> With 1.176 [[solar mass]]es and 1.387 [[solar radius|solar radii]], HAT-P-32A is both larger and more massive than the Sun. HAT-P-32A's effective temperature is 6,001 [[Kelvin scale|K]], making it slightly hotter than the Sun, although it is younger, at an estimated age of 3.8 billion years, thus begun [[nuclear fusion]] in its core not long after the [[Archean]] eon started {{Val|4.031|0.003}}&nbsp;billion years ago.<ref name=EPE /> HAT-P-32A is metal-poor; its measured [[metallicity]] is [Fe/H] = -0.16, which means that it has 69% the iron content of the Sun.<ref name=EPE /> The star's surface gravity is determined to be 4.22, while its [[luminosity]] suggests that it emits 2.43 times the amount of energy that the Sun emits.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> These parameters are adopted given the condition that the planet HAT-P-32b has an irregular ([[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]]) orbit.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nHAT-P-32 has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 11.197, which makes it invisible to the naked eye.<ref name=\"APASS DR9\"/> A search for a binary companion star using [[adaptive optics]] at the [[MMT Observatory]] discovered a companion at a distance of 2.9 [[Minute of arc|arcsecond]]s that is 3.4 magnitudes dimmer than the primary star.<ref name=\"Adams2013\"/>\n\nA very high level of jitter has been detected in the star's spectrum. There is a possibility that the jitter could be induced by the dimmer secondary companion. HAT-P-32's dimmer constituent probably has a mass that is under half of the Sun's mass,<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> while it has a temperature of {{val|3,565|82}} [[Kelvin|K]].<ref name=Zhao2014/>\n\nOther planets with [[orbital period]]s that are smaller than that of HAT-P-32b's orbit may be present in this system. However, when the discovery of the planet was published, not enough radial velocity measurements had been collected to determine if this was the case.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nHAT-P-32b is a [[Hot Jupiter]] that has 0.941 [[Jupiter mass]]es and 2.037 [[Jupiter radius|Jupiter radii]]. In other words, HAT-P-32b is slightly less massive than Jupiter is, although it is nearly twice Jupiter's size.<ref name=EPE /> The planet's [[semimajor axis|average distance]] from its host star is 0.0344&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]], or approximately 3% of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun. It completes an orbit every 2.150009 days (51.6 hours).<ref name=EPE /> HAT-P-32b has an [[equilibrium temperature]] of 1888 K,<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> which is fifteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature.<ref name=datatable />\n\nMany of the described characteristics are derived on the assumption that HAT-P-32b has an orbit that is elliptical (eccentric). The best fit for HAT-P-32b's orbital eccentricity is 0.163, denoting a slightly elliptical orbit, although the jitter effect observed in its host star has made the planet's eccentricity difficult to accurately find. The discoverers have also derived the planet's characteristics assuming that the planet has a circular orbit, although they have given preference to the elliptical model.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nBecause of HAT-P-32b's [[orbital inclination]] with respect to Earth is 88.7\u00ba, the planet is seen almost edge-on with respect to Earth.<ref name=EPE /> It has been found to transit its host star.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nHAT-P-32b had one of the highest radii known amongst planets at the time of its discovery. Like planets [[HAT-P-33b]] and [[WASP-17b]], which are similarly inflated, the mechanism behind this is unknown; it is not solely related to temperature, which is known to have an effect. This is especially clear when compared to [[WASP-18b]], a planet that is hotter than the aforementioned HAT and WASP planets, because despite its temperature its radius is far lower than that of its counterparts.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nIt was also found that the planet radius, observed with planetary transits, varies with wavelength. Different radii for each wavelength could arise from an atmosphere where a Rayleigh scattering haze is combined with a grey cloud deck.<ref name=Tregloan-Reed2018/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adams2013\">{{cite journal | title=Adaptive Optics Images.

Although the possibility that HAT-P-32 is actually a binary star with a dim secondary companion nearly indistinguishable from the primary companion could not be ruled out, HAT-P-32b was confirmed as a planet based on the Blendanal analysis.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nBecause of the high jitter of the star, the best way to collect more data on HAT-P-32b would be to observe an [[occultation]] of HAT-P-32b behind its star using the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nHAT-P-32b's discovery was reported with that of HAT-P-33b in the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]''.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\n==Host star==\nHAT-P-32, or GSC 3281\u201300800, is a double star; the primary is a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G-type]] or [[Stellar classification#Class F|F-type]] [[dwarf star]],<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> and the secondary is a [[Stellar classification#Class M|M-type]] [[dwarf star]].<ref name=Zhao2014/> The system is located {{convert|292|pc|ly}} away from Earth.<ref name=\"Gaia\"/> With 1.176 [[solar mass]]es and 1.387 [[solar radius|solar radii]], HAT-P-32A is both larger and more massive than the Sun. HAT-P-32A's effective temperature is 6,001 [[Kelvin scale|K]], making it slightly hotter than the Sun, although it is younger, at an estimated age of 3.8 billion years, thus begun [[nuclear fusion]] in its core not long after the [[Archean]] eon started 4.031 \u00b1 0.003 billion years ago.<ref name=EPE /> HAT-P-32A is metal-poor; its measured [[metallicity]] is [Fe/H] = -0.16, which means that it has 69% the iron content of the Sun.<ref name=EPE /> The star's surface gravity is determined to be 4.22, while its [[luminosity]] suggests that it emits 2.43 times the amount of energy that the Sun emits.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> These parameters are adopted given the condition that the planet HAT-P-32b has an irregular ([[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]]) orbit.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nHAT-P-32 has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 11.197, which makes it invisible to the naked eye.<ref name=\"APASS DR9\"/> A search for a binary companion star using [[adaptive optics]] at the [[MMT Observatory]] discovered a companion at a distance of 2.9 [[Minute of arc|arcsecond]]s that is 3.4 magnitudes dimmer than the primary star.<ref name=\"Adams2013\"/>\n\nA very high level of jitter has been detected in the star's spectrum. There is a possibility that the jitter could be induced by the dimmer secondary companion. HAT-P-32's dimmer constituent probably has a mass that is under half of the Sun's mass,<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> while it has a temperature of {{val|3,565|82}} [[Kelvin|K]].<ref name=Zhao2014/>\n\nOther planets with [[orbital period]]s that are smaller than that of HAT-P-32b's orbit may be present in this system. However, when the discovery of the planet was published, not enough radial velocity measurements had been collected to determine if this was the case.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nHAT-P-32b is a [[Hot Jupiter]] that has 0.941 [[Jupiter mass]]es and 2.037 [[Jupiter radius|Jupiter radii]]. In other words, HAT-P-32b is slightly less massive than Jupiter is, although it is nearly twice Jupiter's size.<ref name=EPE /> The planet's [[semimajor axis|average distance]] from its host star is 0.0344 [[astronomical unit|AU]], or approximately 3% of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun. It completes an orbit every 2.150009 days (51.6 hours).<ref name=EPE /> HAT-P-32b has an [[equilibrium temperature]] of 1888 K,<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/> which is fifteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature.<ref name=datatable />\n\nMany of the described characteristics are derived on the assumption that HAT-P-32b has an orbit that is elliptical (eccentric). The best fit for HAT-P-32b's orbital eccentricity is 0.163, denoting a slightly elliptical orbit, although the jitter effect observed in its host star has made the planet's eccentricity difficult to accurately find. The discoverers have also derived the planet's characteristics assuming that the planet has a circular orbit, although they have given preference to the elliptical model.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nBecause of HAT-P-32b's [[orbital inclination]] with respect to Earth is 88.7\u00ba, the planet is seen almost edge-on with respect to Earth.<ref name=EPE /> It has been found to transit its host star.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nHAT-P-32b had one of the highest radii known amongst planets at the time of its discovery. Like planets [[HAT-P-33b]] and [[WASP-17b]], which are similarly inflated, the mechanism behind this is unknown; it is not solely related to temperature, which is known to have an effect. This is especially clear when compared to [[WASP-18b]], a planet that is hotter than the aforementioned HAT and WASP planets, because despite its temperature its radius is far lower than that of its counterparts.<ref name=\"Hartman2011\"/>\n\nIt was also found that the planet radius, observed with planetary transits, varies with wavelength. Different radii for each wavelength could arise from an atmosphere where a Rayleigh scattering haze is combined with a grey cloud deck.<ref name=Tregloan-Reed2018/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adams2013\">{{cite journal | title=Adaptive Optics Images.

[[Ion]]s (heavy metals) and [[colloid]]s (organic and inorganic) are mostly held in solution by electrical charges. The addition of ions with opposite charges destabilizes the colloids, allowing them to coagulate. Coagulation can be achieved by a chemical coagulant or by electrical methods. [[Alum]] [Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><sup>.</sup>18[[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]] is such a chemical substance, which has been widely used for ages{{When|date=February 2009}} for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe mechanism of coagulation has been the subject of continual review. It is generally accepted{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} that coagulation is brought about primarily by the reduction of the net surface charge to a point where the colloidal particles, previously stabilized by electrostatic repulsion, can approach closely enough for [[van der Waals force]]s to hold them together and allow aggregation. The reduction of the surface charge is a consequence of the decrease of the repulsive potential of the electrical double layer by the presence of an [[electrolyte]] having opposite charge. In the EC process, the coagulant is generated ''[[In situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]]'' by electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate [[anode]] material. In this process, charged ionic species\u2014metals or otherwise\u2014are removed from wastewater by allowing it to react with an ion having an opposite charge, or with [[Flocculation|floc]] of metallic [[hydroxide]]s generated within the effluent.\n\nElectrocoagulation offers an alternative to the use of metal [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] or [[polymer]]s and [[polyelectrolyte]] addition for breaking stable [[emulsion]]s and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]]. The technology removes metals, colloidal solids and particles, and soluble inorganic pollutants from aqueous media by introducing highly charged polymeric metal hydroxide species. These species neutralize the electrostatic charges on suspended solids and oil droplets to facilitate agglomeration or coagulation and resultant separation from the aqueous phase. The treatment prompts the precipitation of certain metals and salts.\n\n<blockquote>\"Chemical coagulation has been used for decades to destabilize suspensions and to effect precipitation of soluble metals species, as well as other inorganic species from aqueous streams, thereby permitting their removal through sedimentation or filtration. Alum, lime and/or polymers have been the chemical coagulants used. These processes, however, tend to generate large volumes of sludge with high bound water content that can be slow to filter and difficult to dewater. These treatment processes also tend to increase the [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) content of the effluent, making it unacceptable for reuse within industrial applications.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Process Chemistry for Water and Wastewater Treatment |last1=Benefield |first1=Larry D. |last2=Judkins |first2=Joseph F.|last3=Weand |first3=Barron L. |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=978-0-13-722975-8 |page=212 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Although the electrocoagulation mechanism resembles chemical coagulation in that the cationic species are responsible for the neutralization of surface charges, the characteristics of the electrocoagulated flock differ dramatically from those generated by chemical coagulation. An electrocogulated flock tends to contain less bound water, is more shear resistant and is more readily filterable\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Woytowich |first1=David L. |last2=Dalrymple |first2=C.W. |last3=Britton |first3=M.G.  |date=Spring 1993 |title=Electrocoagulation (CURE) Treatment of Ship Bilge Water for the US Coast Guard in Alaska |journal=Marine Technology Society Journal |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=92 |url=http://www.mtsociety.org |doi=  |issn=0025-3324}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Description ===\nIn its simplest form, an electrocoagulation reactor is made up of an electrolytic cell with one [[anode]] and one [[cathode]]. When connected to an external power source, the anode material will electrochemically [[Corrosion|corrode]] due to oxidation, while the cathode will be subjected to [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].\n\nAn EC system essentially consists of pairs of conductive metal plates in parallel, which act as monopolar [[electrode]]s. It furthermore requires a [[direct current]] power source, a resistance box to regulate the [[Electric current|current]] density and a [[multimeter]] to read the current values. The conductive metal plates are commonly known as \"sacrificial electrodes.\" The sacrificial anode lowers the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] potential of the anode and minimizes the passivation of the cathode. The sacrificial anodes and cathodes can be of the same or of different materials.\n\nThe arrangement of monopolar electrodes with cells in series is electrically similar to a single cell with many electrodes and interconnections. In series cell arrangement, a higher potential difference is required for a given current to flow because the cells connected in series have higher resistance. The same current would, however, flow through all the electrodes. On the other hand, in parallel or bipolar arrangement the electric current is divided between all the electrodes in relation to the resistance of the individual cells, and each face on the electrode has a different polarity.\n\nDuring [[electrolysis]], the positive side undergoes anodic reactions, while on the negative side, cathodic reactions are encountered. Consumable metal plates, such as [[iron]] or [[aluminum]], are usually used as sacrificial electrodes to continuously produce ions in the water. The released ions neutralize the charges of the particles and thereby initiate coagulation. The released ions remove undesirable contaminants either by chemical reaction and precipitation, or by causing the colloidal materials to coalesce, which can then be removed by flotation. In addition, as water containing colloidal particulates, oils, or other contaminants move through the applied electric field, there may be [[ionization]], electrolysis, [[hydrolysis]], and [[Radical (chemistry)|free-radical]] formation which can alter the physical and chemical properties of water and contaminants. As a result, the reactive and excited state causes contaminants to be released from the water and destroyed or made less soluble.\n\nIt is important to note that electrocoagulation technology cannot remove infinitely soluble matter. Therefore, ions with molecular weights smaller than Ca<sup>+2</sup> or Mg<sup>+2</sup> cannot be dissociated from the aqueous medium.\n\n=== Reactions within the electrocoagulation reactor ===\nWithin the electrocoagulation reactor, several distinct electrochemical reactions are produced independently. These are:\n\n* '''Seeding''', resulting from the anode reduction of metal ions that become new centers for larger, stable, insoluble complexes that precipitate as complex metal ions.\n* '''Emulsion Breaking''', resulting from the oxygen and hydrogen ions that bond into the water receptor sites of emulsified oil molecules creating a water-insoluble complex separating water from oil, driller's mud, dyes, inks, fatty acids, etc. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohamud|first=Abdihakem Abdi|last2=\u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan|first2=Yasemin|last3=Bekta\u015f|first3=Nihal|last4=Yatmaz|first4=H.

Electrodes can be made of iron, aluminum, [[titanium]], [[graphite]] or other materials, depending upon the wastewater to be treated and the contaminants to be removed. Temperature and pressure appear to have only a  minor effect on the process.\n \nIn the EC process the water-contaminant mixture separates into a floating layer, a mineral-rich flocculated sediment, and clear water. The floating layer is generally removed by means of an overflow weir or similar removal method. The aggregated flocculent mass settles either in the reaction vessel or in subsequent settling tanks due to gravitational force.\n\nFollowing removal to a sludge collection tank, it is typically dewatered to a semi-dry cake using a mechanical screw press. The clear, treated (supernatant) water is typically then pumped to a buffer tank for later disposal and/or reuse in the plant's designated process.\n\n=== Advantages ===\n* EC requires simple equipment and is easy to operate with sufficient operational latitude to handle most problems encountered on running.\n* Wastewater treated by EC gives palatable, clear, colorless and odorless water.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n* Sludge formed by EC tends to be readily settable and easy to de-water, compared to conventional alum or ferric hydroxide sludges, because the mainly metallic oxides/hydroxides have no residual charge.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* Flocs formed by EC are similar to chemical floc, except that EC floc tends to be much larger, contains less bound water, is acid-resistant and more stable, and therefore, can be separated faster by filtration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Al-Shannag|first1=Mohammad|last2=Bani-Melhem|first2=Khalid|last3=Al-Anber|first3=Zaid|last4=Al-Qodah|first4=Zakaria|title=Enhancement of COD-Nutrients Removals and Filterability of Secondary Clarifier Municipal Wastewater Influent Using Electrocoagulation Technique|journal=Separation Science and Technology|date=January 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=673\u2013680|doi=10.1080/01496395.2012.707729}}</ref>\n* EC can produce effluent with less TDS content as compared with chemical treatments, particularly if the metal ions can be precipitated as either hydroxides or carbonates (such as magnesium and calcium.

Electrocoagulation requires no filters, no daily maintenance, no additives, and removes any size of suspended solids, oil, grease and heavy metals.\n\n=== Technology ===\nTreatment of wastewater and wash water by EC has been practiced for most of the 20th century with increasing popularity. In the last decade, this technology has been increasingly used in the United States, South America and Europe for treatment of industrial wastewater containing metals.<ref>Rodriguez J, Stopi\u0107 S, Krause G, Friedrich B (2007).

A large one-thousand gallon per minute cooling tower application in El Paso, Texas illustrates electrocoagulations growing recognition and acceptance to the industrial community. In addition, EC has been applied to treat water containing [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Food industry|foodstuff]] waste, oil wastes, dyes, output from public transit and marinas, wash water, ink, [[total suspended solids|suspended particles]], chemical and mechanical polishing waste, organic matter from [[landfill]] [[leachate]]s, [[defluorination]] of water, synthetic detergent effluents, and solutions containing heavy metals.<ref>Lai, C.

[[Ion]]s (heavy metals) and [[colloid]]s (organic and inorganic) are mostly held in solution by electrical charges. The addition of ions with opposite charges destabilizes the colloids, allowing them to coagulate. Coagulation can be achieved by a chemical coagulant or by electrical methods. [[Alum]] [Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><sup>.</sup>18[[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]] is such a chemical substance, which has been widely used for ages{{When|date=February 2009}} for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe mechanism of coagulation has been the subject of continual review. It is generally accepted{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} that coagulation is brought about primarily by the reduction of the net surface charge to a point where the colloidal particles, previously stabilized by electrostatic repulsion, can approach closely enough for [[van der Waals force]]s to hold them together and allow aggregation. The reduction of the surface charge is a consequence of the decrease of the repulsive potential of the electrical double layer by the presence of an [[electrolyte]] having opposite charge. In the EC process, the coagulant is generated ''[[In situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]]'' by electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate [[anode]] material. In this process, charged ionic species\u2014metals or otherwise\u2014are removed from wastewater by allowing it to react with an ion having an opposite charge, or with [[Flocculation|floc]] of metallic [[hydroxide]]s generated within the effluent.\n\nElectrocoagulation offers an alternative to the use of metal [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] or [[polymer]]s and [[polyelectrolyte]] addition for breaking stable [[emulsion]]s and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]]. The technology removes metals, colloidal solids and particles, and soluble inorganic pollutants from aqueous media by introducing highly charged polymeric metal hydroxide species. These species neutralize the electrostatic charges on suspended solids and oil droplets to facilitate agglomeration or coagulation and resultant separation from the aqueous phase. The treatment prompts the precipitation of certain metals and salts.\n\n<blockquote>\"Chemical coagulation has been used for decades to destabilize suspensions and to effect precipitation of soluble metals species, as well as other inorganic species from aqueous streams, thereby permitting their removal through sedimentation or filtration. Alum, lime and/or polymers have been the chemical coagulants used. These processes, however, tend to generate large volumes of sludge with high bound water content that can be slow to filter and difficult to dewater. These treatment processes also tend to increase the [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) content of the effluent, making it unacceptable for reuse within industrial applications.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Process Chemistry for Water and Wastewater Treatment |last1=Benefield |first1=Larry D. |last2=Judkins |first2=Joseph F.|last3=Weand |first3=Barron L. |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=978-0-13-722975-8 |page=212 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Although the electrocoagulation mechanism resembles chemical coagulation in that the cationic species are responsible for the neutralization of surface charges, the characteristics of the electrocoagulated flock differ dramatically from those generated by chemical coagulation. An electrocogulated flock tends to contain less bound water, is more shear resistant and is more readily filterable\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Woytowich |first1=David L. |last2=Dalrymple |first2=C.W. |last3=Britton |first3=M.G.  |date=Spring 1993 |title=Electrocoagulation (CURE) Treatment of Ship Bilge Water for the US Coast Guard in Alaska |journal=Marine Technology Society Journal |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=92 |url=http://www.mtsociety.org |doi=  |issn=0025-3324}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Description ===\nIn its simplest form, an electrocoagulation reactor is made up of an electrolytic cell with one [[anode]] and one [[cathode]]. When connected to an external power source, the anode material will electrochemically [[Corrosion|corrode]] due to oxidation, while the cathode will be subjected to [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].\n\nAn EC system essentially consists of pairs of conductive metal plates in parallel, which act as monopolar [[electrode]]s. It furthermore requires a [[direct current]] power source, a resistance box to regulate the [[Electric current|current]] density and a [[multimeter]] to read the current values. The conductive metal plates are commonly known as \"sacrificial electrodes.\" The sacrificial anode lowers the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] potential of the anode and minimizes the passivation of the cathode. The sacrificial anodes and cathodes can be of the same or of different materials.\n\nThe arrangement of monopolar electrodes with cells in series is electrically similar to a single cell with many electrodes and interconnections. In series cell arrangement, a higher potential difference is required for a given current to flow because the cells connected in series have higher resistance. The same current would, however, flow through all the electrodes. On the other hand, in parallel or bipolar arrangement the electric current is divided between all the electrodes in relation to the resistance of the individual cells, and each face on the electrode has a different polarity.\n\nDuring [[electrolysis]], the positive side undergoes anodic reactions, while on the negative side, cathodic reactions are encountered. Consumable metal plates, such as [[iron]] or [[aluminum]], are usually used as sacrificial electrodes to continuously produce ions in the water. The released ions neutralize the charges of the particles and thereby initiate coagulation. The released ions remove undesirable contaminants either by chemical reaction and precipitation, or by causing the colloidal materials to coalesce, which can then be removed by flotation. In addition, as water containing colloidal particulates, oils, or other contaminants move through the applied electric field, there may be [[ionization]], electrolysis, [[hydrolysis]], and [[Radical (chemistry)|free-radical]] formation which can alter the physical and chemical properties of water and contaminants. As a result, the reactive and excited state causes contaminants to be released from the water and destroyed or made less soluble.\n\nIt is important to note that electrocoagulation technology cannot remove infinitely soluble matter. Therefore, ions with molecular weights smaller than Ca<sup>+2</sup> or Mg<sup>+2</sup> cannot be dissociated from the aqueous medium.\n\n=== Reactions within the electrocoagulation reactor ===\nWithin the electrocoagulation reactor, several distinct electrochemical reactions are produced independently. These are:\n\n* '''Seeding''', resulting from the anode reduction of metal ions that become new centers for larger, stable, insoluble complexes that precipitate as complex metal ions.\n* '''Emulsion Breaking''', resulting from the oxygen and hydrogen ions that bond into the water receptor sites of emulsified oil molecules creating a water-insoluble complex separating water from oil, driller's mud, dyes, inks and fatty acids etc.\n* '''[[Halogen]] Complexing''', as the metal ions bind themselves to chlorines in a chlorinated hydrocarbon molecule resulting in a large insoluble complex separating water from [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, chlorinated [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, etc.\n* '''Bleaching''' by the oxygen ions produced in the reaction chamber oxidizes dyes, [[cyanide]]s, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, biohazards, etc. Electron flooding of electrodes forced ions to be formed to carry charge into the water, thereby eliminating the polar effect of the water complex, allowing colloidal materials to precipitate and the current controlled ion transport between the electrodes creates an osmotic pressure that typically ruptures bacteria, cysts, and viruses.\n* '''Oxidation Reduction''' reactions are forced to their natural end point within the reaction tank which speeds up the natural process of nature that occurs in wet chemistry, where concentration gradients and Solubility Products (KsP) are the chief determinants to enable reactions to reach stoichiometric completion. \n* '''Electrocoagulation Induced pH''' swings toward neutral.\n\n=== Optimizing reactions ===\nCareful selection of the reaction tank material is essential along with control of the current, flow rate and [[pH]]. Electrodes can be made of iron, aluminum, [[titanium]], [[graphite]] or other materials, depending upon the wastewater to be treated and the contaminants to be removed. Temperature and pressure appear to have only a  minor effect on the process.\n \nIn the EC process the water-contaminant mixture separates into a floating layer, a mineral-rich flocculated sediment, and clear water. The floating layer is generally removed by means of an overflow weir or similar removal method. The aggregated flocculent mass settles either in the reaction vessel or in subsequent settling tanks due to gravitational force.\n\nFollowing removal to a sludge collection tank, it is typically dewatered to a semi-dry cake using a mechanical screw press. The clear, treated (supernatant) water is typically then pumped to a buffer tank for later disposal and/or reuse in the plant's designated process.\n\n=== Advantages ===\n* EC requires simple equipment and is easy to operate with sufficient operational latitude to handle most problems encountered on running.\n* Wastewater treated by EC gives palatable, clear, colorless and odorless water.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n* Sludge formed by EC tends to be readily settable and easy to de-water, compared to conventional alum or ferric hydroxide sludges, because the mainly metallic oxides/hydroxides have no residual charge.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* Flocs formed by EC are similar to chemical floc, except that EC floc tends to be much larger, contains less bound water, is acid-resistant and more stable, and therefore, can be separated faster by filtration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Al-Shannag|first1=Mohammad|last2=Bani-Melhem|first2=Khalid|last3=Al-Anber|first3=Zaid|last4=Al-Qodah|first4=Zakaria|title=Enhancement of COD-Nutrients Removals and Filterability of Secondary Clarifier Municipal Wastewater Influent Using Electrocoagulation Technique|journal=Separation Science and Technology|date=January 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=673\u2013680|doi=10.1080/01496395.2012.707729}}</ref>\n* EC can produce effluent with less TDS content as compared with chemical treatments, particularly if the metal ions can be precipitated as either hydroxides or carbonates (such as magnesium and calcium. EC generally has little if any impact on sodium and potassium ions in solution.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} \n* The EC process has the advantage of removing the smallest colloidal particles, because the applied electric field neutralises any residual charge, thereby facilitating the coagulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Al-Shannag|first1=Mohammad|last2=Bani-Melhem|first2=Khalid|last3=Al-Anber|first3=Zaid|last4=Al-Qodah|first4=Zakaria|title=Enhancement of COD-Nutrients Removals and Filterability of Secondary Clarifier Municipal Wastewater Influent Using Electrocoagulation Technique|journal=Separation Science and Technology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=673\u2013680|doi=10.1080/01496395.2012.707729|year=2013}}</ref>\n* The EC process generally avoids excessive use of chemicals and so there is reduced requirement to neutralize excess chemicals and less possibility of secondary pollution caused by chemical substances added at high concentration as when chemical coagulation of wastewater is used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* The gas bubbles produced during electrolysis can conveniently carry the pollutant components to the top of the solution where it can be more easily concentrated, collected and removed by a motorised skimmer.\n* The electrolytic processes in the EC cell are controlled electrically and with no moving parts, thus requiring less maintenance.\n* Dosing incoming waste water with [[sodium hypochlorite]] assists reduction of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and consequent [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) although this should be avoided for wastewater containing high levels of organic compounds or dissolved ammonia (NH4+) due to formation of [[trihalogenated methanes]] (THMs) or other [[chlorinated organics]]. Sodium hypochlorite can be generated electrolytically in an E cell using platinum and similar inert electrodes or by using external electrochlorinators.<ref>United States Bureau of Reclamation.

In this function the EC provides protection of the low-pressure membrane that is more general than that provided by chemical coagulation and more effective. EC is very effective at removing a number of membrane fouling species (such as silica, alkaline earth metal hydroxides and transition group metals) as well as removing many species that chemical coagulation alone cannot remove.
