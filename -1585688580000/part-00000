In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), catatonia is not recognized as a separate disorder, but is associated with psychiatric conditions such as [[schizophrenia]] (catatonic type), [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[narcolepsy]], [[drug abuse]] or [[overdose]] (or both). It may also be seen in many medical disorders including infections (such as [[encephalitis]]), [[autoimmune disorder]]s, focal neurological lesions (including [[stroke]]s), alcohol withdrawal,<ref name=\"Geoffroy-2012\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Geoffroy PA, Rolland B, Cottencin O | title = Catatonia and alcohol withdrawal: a complex and underestimated syndrome. | journal = Alcohol Alcohol. | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 288\u201390 |date=May\u2013June 2012 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agr170 | pmid = 22278315 }}</ref> abrupt or overly rapid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rosebush PI |author2=Mazurek MF. |date=August 1996 | title = Catatonia after benzodiazepine withdrawal | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 315\u20139 | pmid = 8835707 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199608000-00007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deuschle M, Lederbogen F |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=41\u20132 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11229621 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15188|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanemoto K, Miyamoto T, Abe R |title=Ictal catatonia as a manifestation of de novo absence status epilepticus following benzodiazepine withdrawal |journal=Seizure |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=364\u20136 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10512781 |doi=10.1053/seiz.1999.0309 }}</ref> [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[neoplasm]]s, [[head injury]],<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\" /> and some metabolic conditions: [[homocystinuria]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and [[hypercalcaemia]].<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\"/>\n\nIt can be an adverse reaction to prescribed medication. It bears similarity to conditions such as [[encephalitis lethargica]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. There are a variety of treatments available; [[benzodiazepine]]s are a first-line treatment strategy. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is also sometimes used.

Stuporous catatonia is characterised by immobility during which people may hold rigid poses ([[stupor]]), an inability to speak ([[mutism]]), or [[waxy flexibility]], in which they maintain positions after being placed in them by someone else. [[Mutism]] may be partial and they may repeat meaningless phrases or speak only to repeat what someone else says. People with stuporous catatonia may also show stereotyped, repetitive movements ([[stereotypy]]). Excited catatonia is characterised by bizarre, non-goal-directed hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\n\nCatatonia is a syndrome that can occur in various psychiatric disorders, including [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[brief psychotic disorder]], and substance-induced psychotic disorder. It appears as the Kahlbaum syndrome (motionless catatonia), malignant catatonia (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, [[Serotonin syndrome|toxic serotonin syndrome]]), and excited forms (delirious mania, catatonic excitement, [[oneirophrenia]]).<ref name = \"Fink & Taylor\">Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003\"</ref> It has also been recognized as grafted on to [[autism spectrum disorders]].<ref>Dhossche D et al.: Catatonia in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nAccording to the [[DSM-5]], \"Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)\" (code 293.89 [F06.1]) is diagnosed if the clinical picture is dominated by at least three of the following:<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\">{{Cite book| last=American Psychiatric Association| year=2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| pages=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/119 119\u2013121]| isbn=978-0-89042-555-8| url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/119}}</ref>\n\n* [[stupor]] (i.e., no psycho-motor activity; not actively relating to environment)\n* [[catalepsy]] (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity)\n* [[waxy flexibility]] (i.e., allow positioning by examiner and maintain position)\n* [[mutism]] (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known [[aphasia]]])\n* [[Catatonic stupor|negativism]] (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli)\n* [[Abnormal posturing|posturing]] (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity)\n* mannerisms (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions)\n* [[stereotypy]] (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements)\n* agitation, not influenced by external stimuli\n* grimacing (i.e., making a [[Facial expression|grimace]] like children)\n* [[echolalia]] (i.e., mimicking another's speech)\n* [[echopraxia]] (i.e., mimicking another's movements)\n\nOther disorders (additional code 293.89 [F06.1] to indicate the presence of the [[Comorbidity|co-morbid]] catatonia):\n* Catatonia associated with [[autism spectrum disorder]]\n* Catatonia associated with [[schizophrenia]] spectrum and other psychotic disorders\n** Catatonia associated with [[brief psychotic disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with [[schizophreniform disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with [[schizoaffective disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with substance-induced psychotic disorder\n* Catatonia associated with [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and related disorders\n* Catatonia associated with [[major depressive disorder]]\n* Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition\n\nIf catatonic [[symptom]]s are present but they do not form the catatonic [[syndrome]], a medication- or substance-induced aetiology should first be considered.<ref name=\"DSM-5Differential\">{{cite book |author=Michael B.

Individuals in this state are extremely hyperactive, although, as aforementioned, the activity seems to lack purpose. The individual may also experience delusions or hallucinations.<ref>Nolen-Hoeksema. Abnormal psychology.

The diagnosis is validated by the quick response to either benzodiazepines or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). While proven useful in the past, barbiturates are no longer commonly used in [[psychiatry]]; thus the option of either benzodiazepines or ECT.\n\n==Treatment==\nInitial treatment is aimed at providing symptomatic relief. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are the first line of treatment, and high doses are often required. A test dose of intramuscular [[lorazepam]] will often result in marked improvement within half an hour.

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), catatonia is not recognized as a separate disorder, but is associated with psychiatric conditions such as [[schizophrenia]] (catatonic type), [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[narcolepsy]], [[drug abuse]] or [[overdose]] (or both). It may also be seen in many medical disorders including infections (such as [[encephalitis]]), [[autoimmune disorder]]s, focal neurological lesions (including [[stroke]]s), alcohol withdrawal,<ref name=\"Geoffroy-2012\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Geoffroy PA, Rolland B, Cottencin O | title = Catatonia and alcohol withdrawal: a complex and underestimated syndrome. | journal = Alcohol Alcohol. | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 288\u201390 |date=May\u2013June 2012 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agr170 | pmid = 22278315 }}</ref> abrupt or overly rapid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rosebush PI |author2=Mazurek MF. |date=August 1996 | title = Catatonia after benzodiazepine withdrawal | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 315\u20139 | pmid = 8835707 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199608000-00007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deuschle M, Lederbogen F |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=41\u20132 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11229621 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15188|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanemoto K, Miyamoto T, Abe R |title=Ictal catatonia as a manifestation of de novo absence status epilepticus following benzodiazepine withdrawal |journal=Seizure |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=364\u20136 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10512781 |doi=10.1053/seiz.1999.0309 }}</ref> [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[neoplasm]]s, [[head injury]],<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\" /> and some metabolic conditions: [[homocystinuria]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and [[hypercalcaemia]].<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\"/>\n\nIt can be an adverse reaction to prescribed medication. It bears similarity to conditions such as [[encephalitis lethargica]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. There are a variety of treatments available; [[benzodiazepine]]s are a first-line treatment strategy. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is also sometimes used.

Stuporous catatonia is characterised by immobility during which people may hold rigid poses ([[stupor]]), an inability to speak ([[mutism]]), or [[waxy flexibility]], in which they maintain positions after being placed in them by someone else. [[Mutism]] may be partial and they may repeat meaningless phrases or speak only to repeat what someone else says. People with stuporous catatonia may also show stereotyped, repetitive movements ([[stereotypy]]). Excited catatonia is characterised by bizarre, non-goal-directed hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\n\nCatatonia is a syndrome that can occur in various psychiatric disorders, including [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[brief psychotic disorder]], and substance-induced psychotic disorder. It appears as the Kahlbaum syndrome (motionless catatonia), malignant catatonia (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, [[Serotonin syndrome|toxic serotonin syndrome]]), and excited forms (delirious mania, catatonic excitement, [[oneirophrenia]]).<ref name = \"Fink & Taylor\">Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003\"</ref> It has also been recognized as grafted on to [[autism spectrum disorders]].<ref>Dhossche D et al.: Catatonia in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nAccording to the [[DSM-5]], \"Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)\" (code 293.89 [F06.1]) is diagnosed if the clinical picture is dominated by at least three of the following:<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\">{{Cite book| last=American Psychiatric Association| year=2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| pages=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/119 119\u2013121]| isbn=978-0-89042-555-8| url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/119}}</ref>\n\n* [[stupor]] (i.e., no psycho-motor activity; not actively relating to environment)\n* [[catalepsy]] (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity)\n* [[waxy flexibility]] (i.e., allow positioning by examiner and maintain position)\n* [[mutism]] (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known [[aphasia]]])\n* [[Catatonic stupor|negativism]] (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli)\n* [[Abnormal posturing|posturing]] (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity)\n* mannerisms (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions)\n* [[stereotypy]] (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements)\n* agitation, not influenced by external stimuli\n* grimacing (i.e., making a [[Facial expression|grimace]] like children)\n* [[echolalia]] (i.e., mimicking another's speech)\n* [[echopraxia]] (i.e., mimicking another's movements)\n\nOther disorders (additional code 293.89 [F06.1] to indicate the presence of the [[Comorbidity|co-morbid]] catatonia):\n* Catatonia associated with [[autism spectrum disorder]]\n* Catatonia associated with [[schizophrenia]] spectrum and other psychotic disorders\n** Catatonia associated with [[brief psychotic disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with [[schizophreniform disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with [[schizoaffective disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with substance-induced psychotic disorder\n* Catatonia associated with [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and related disorders\n* Catatonia associated with [[major depressive disorder]]\n* Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition\n\nIf catatonic [[symptom]]s are present but they do not form the catatonic [[syndrome]], a medication- or substance-induced aetiology should first be considered.<ref name=\"DSM-5Differential\">{{cite book |author=Michael B.

It is the described as state of union of one's soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Schuhmacher|1994|p=202}}\n\nThis Lingayat concept is similar to ''shunya Brahma'' concept found in certain texts of [[Vaishnavism]], particularly in [[Odia language|Odiya]], such as the poetic ''Panchasakhas''. It explains the ''Nirguna Brahman'' idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as \"personified void\". Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include ''shunya purusha'' and ''Jagannatha'' in certain texts.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Das|1994|p=9, 101\u2013112}} However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as ''Mahima Dharma'', the idea of ''Shunya'' is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical ''[[Brahman]]'', rather than to the ''[[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]]'' concept of Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}} However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|B\u00e4umer|2010}}\n\nSripati, a Veerashaiva scholar, explained Lingayatism philosophy in ''Srikara Bhashya'', in [[Vedanta]] terms, stating Lingayatism to be a form of qualified non-dualism, wherein the individual [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atman (self, soul), Shiva is one's Atman, one's Atman is Shiva.{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}} Sripati's analysis places Lingayatism in a form closer to the 11th century [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosopher [[Ramanuja]], than to [[Advaita]] philosopher [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}}\n\n====Qualified monism====\nOther scholars state that Lingayatism is more complex than the description of the Virasaiva scholar Sripati. It united diverse spiritual trends during Basava's era. Jan Peter Schouten states that it tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the monistic unity of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}} Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Shankara's Advaita traditions, naming it ''Shakti-Vishishtadvaita'', that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}} But Basava's approach is different than [[Adi Shankara]], states Schouten, in that Basava emphasises the path of devotion, compared to Shankara's emphasis on the path of knowledge\u2014a system of monistic [[Advaita]] philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=111-112}}\n\n===Ethical conduct===\n\n====Panchacharas====\n[[File:Kudala Sangama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kudalasangama]] in [[Bagalkot district]], a temple and pilgrimage site linked to Guru Basavanna]]\n\nThe ''Panchacharas'' describe the five codes of conduct to be followed by the Lingayats. The ''[[Panchachara]]s'' include:{{sfn|Klostermaier|2010}}\n* Ling\u0101ch\u0101ra&nbsp;\u2013 Daily worship of the individual Ishtalinga icon, one to three times day.\n* Sad\u0101ch\u0101ra&nbsp;\u2013 Attention to vocation and duty, and adherence to the seven rules of conduct issued by [[Basavanna]]:\n**''kala beda'' (Do not steal)\n**''kola beda'' (Do not kill or hurt)\n**''husiya nudiyalu beda'' (Do not utter lies)\n**''thanna bannisabeda'' (Do not praise yourself* i.e. practice humility)\n**''idira haliyalu beda'' (Do not criticize others)\n**''muniya beda'' (shun anger)\n**''anyarige asahya padabeda'' (Do not be intolerant towards others)\n* Siv\u0101ch\u0101ra&nbsp;\u2013 acknowledging [[Shiva]] as the supreme divine being and upholding the equality and well-being of all human beings.\n* Bhrity\u0101ch\u0101ra&nbsp;\u2013 Compassion towards all creatures.\n* Gan\u0101ch\u0101ra&nbsp;\u2013 Defence of the community and its tenets.\n\n====Ashtavarana====\nThe ''Ashtavaranas'', the eight-fold armour that shields the devotee from extraneous distraction and worldly attachments. The ''[[Ashtavarana]]s'' include:{{sfn|Klostermaier|2010}}\n* [[Guru]]&nbsp;\u2013 obedience towards Guru, the Mentor;\n* [[Linga]]&nbsp;\u2013 wearing the ''Ishtalinga'' on your body at all times;\n* [[Jangama]]&nbsp;\u2013 reverence for Shiva ascetics as incarnations of divinity;\n* [[P\u0101dodaka]]&nbsp;\u2013 sipping the water used for bathing the Linga;\n* [[Pras\u0101da]]&nbsp;\u2013 sacred offerings;\n* [[Vibhuti]]&nbsp;\u2013 smearing holy ash on oneself daily;\n* [[Rudr\u0101ksha]]&nbsp;\u2013 wearing a string of ''rudraksha'' (holy beads, seeds of [[Elaeocarpus ganitrus]]);\n* [[Mantra]]&nbsp;\u2013 reciting the mantra of \"Namah Shivaya: (salutation to Shiva)\"\n\n====''K\u0101yakav\u0113 Kail\u0101sa'' doctrine and karma====\n[[File:Kailaasa.png|thumb|''Kayakave Kailasa'' in [[Kannada]]]]\n''Kayakave kailasa'' is a slogan in Virasaivism. It means \"work is heaven\" or \"to work [''Kayakave''] is to be in the Lord's Kingdom [''Kailasa'']\". Some scholars translate ''Kayaka'' as \"worship, ritual\", while others translate it as \"work, labour\". The slogan is attributed to Basava, and generally interpreted to signify a work ethic for all social classes.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=35-36}}\n\nLingayat poet-saints accepted the concept of ''[[karma]]'' and repeatedly mention it in their Shiva poetry. For example, states Ramanujan, Mahadeviyakka mentions karma and resulting chain of rebirths that are cut short by bhakti to Shiva.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|pp=116-117 with footnote 45 on p. 194}} Lingayatism has the concepts of karma and dharma, but the Lingayatism doctrine of karma is not one of fate and destiny.

Regardless of one's vocation, Lingayatism suggests giving and donating a part of one's time, effort and income to one's community and to religious mendicants.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=111\u2013113, 120, 140\u2013141}}{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|p=40\u201345}}\n\nAccording to Virasaivism, skilful work and service to one's community, without discrimination, is a means to experiencing the divine, a sentiment that continues to be revered in present-day Virasaivas.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=138\u2013141}} According to Jan Peter Schouten, this doctrine is philosophically rooted in the more ancient [[Soham (Sanskrit)|So'ham]] Sanskrit [[advaita|oneness]] mantra related to [[Shiva]], and which means \"I am He\".{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=113\u2013114}} This social ethic is also found among other Hindu communities of South India, and includes community provisioning of grains and sharing other essentials particularly with poorer members of society and those affected by natural or other disasters.{{sfn|Vasavi|1999|p=71\u201376, 79\u201381}}\n\n===Lingadharane===\n''Lingadharane'' is the ceremony of initiation among Lingayats. Though ''lingadharane'' can be performed at any age, it is usually performed when a fetus in the womb is 7\u20138 months old. The family Guru performs [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] and provides the ishtalinga to the mother, who then ties it to her own ishtalinga until birth. At birth the mother secures the new ishtalinga to her child. Upon attaining the age of 8\u201311 years, the child receives ''[[Diksha]]'' from the family Guru to know the proper procedure to perform pooja of ishtalinga. From birth to death, the child wears the Linga at all times and it is worshipped as a personal ishtalinga. The ''Linga'' is wrapped in a cloth housed in a small silver and wooden box. It is to be worn on the chest, over the seat of the indwelling deity within the heart. Some people wear it on the chest or around the body using a thread.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nLingayats are strict [[vegetarian]]s.

In addition, they have continued to build the community halls and Shaiva temple traditions of South India. Their temples include Shiva linga in the sanctum, a sitting Nandi facing the linga, with mandapa and other features.

In particular, the ''[[Shunyasampadane|Shunya Sampadane]]'' texts present the ideas of [[Allama Prabhu]] in a form of dialogue, where ''shunya'' is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as state of union of one's soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Schuhmacher|1994|p=202}}\n\nThis Lingayat concept is similar to ''shunya Brahma'' concept found in certain texts of [[Vaishnavism]], particularly in [[Odia language|Odiya]], such as the poetic ''Panchasakhas''. It explains the ''Nirguna Brahman'' idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as \"personified void\". Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include ''shunya purusha'' and ''Jagannatha'' in certain texts.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Das|1994|p=9, 101\u2013112}} However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as ''Mahima Dharma'', the idea of ''Shunya'' is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical ''[[Brahman]]'', rather than to the ''[[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]]'' concept of Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}} However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|B\u00e4umer|2010}}\n\nSripati, a Veerashaiva scholar, explained Lingayatism philosophy in ''Srikara Bhashya'', in [[Vedanta]] terms, stating Lingayatism to be a form of qualified non-dualism, wherein the individual [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atman (self, soul), Shiva is one's Atman, one's Atman is Shiva.{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}} Sripati's analysis places Lingayatism in a form closer to the 11th century [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosopher [[Ramanuja]], than to [[Advaita]] philosopher [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}}\n\n====Qualified monism====\nOther scholars state that Lingayatism is more complex than the description of the Virasaiva scholar Sripati. It united diverse spiritual trends during Basava's era. Jan Peter Schouten states that it tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the monistic unity of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}} Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Shankara's Advaita traditions, naming it ''Shakti-Vishishtadvaita'', that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}} But Basava's approach is different than [[Adi Shankara]], states Schouten, in that Basava emphasises the path of devotion, compared to Shankara's emphasis on the path of knowledge\u2014a system of monistic [[Advaita]] philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=111-112}}\n\n===Ethical conduct===\n\n====Panchacharas====\n[[File:Kudala Sangama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kudalasangama]] in [[Bagalkot district]], a temple and pilgrimage site linked to Guru Basavanna]]\n\nThe ''Panchacharas'' describe the five codes of conduct to be followed by the Lingayats.

It means \"work is heaven\" or \"to work [''Kayakave''] is to be in the Lord's Kingdom [''Kailasa'']\". Some scholars translate ''Kayaka'' as \"worship, ritual\", while others translate it as \"work, labour\". The slogan is attributed to Basava, and generally interpreted to signify a work ethic for all social classes.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=35-36}}\n\nLingayat poet-saints accepted the concept of ''[[karma]]'' and repeatedly mention it in their Shiva poetry. For example, states Ramanujan, Mahadeviyakka mentions karma and resulting chain of rebirths that are cut short by bhakti to Shiva.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|pp=116-117 with footnote 45 on p. 194}} Lingayatism has the concepts of karma and dharma, but the Lingayatism doctrine of karma is not one of fate and destiny.

Though ''lingadharane'' can be performed at any age, it is usually performed when a fetus in the womb is 7\u20138 months old. The family Guru performs [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] and provides the ishtalinga to the mother, who then ties it to her own ishtalinga until birth. At birth the mother secures the new ishtalinga to her child. Upon attaining the age of 8\u201311 years, the child receives ''[[Diksha]]'' from the family Guru to know the proper procedure to perform pooja of ishtalinga. From birth to death, the child wears the Linga at all times and it is worshipped as a personal ishtalinga. The ''Linga'' is wrapped in a cloth housed in a small silver and wooden box. It is to be worn on the chest, over the seat of the indwelling deity within the heart. Some people wear it on the chest or around the body using a thread.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nLingayats are strict [[vegetarian]]s. Devout Lingayats do not consume beef, or meat of any kind including fish.{{sfn|Ishwaran|1983|p=119\u2013120}} The drinking of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is prohibited.<ref name=cultural.maharashtra.gov group=web/>\n\n===Militancy===\nThe early Lingayat literature, including the Basava Purana, highly praises militant action against anyone who persecutes a fellow Lingayat or their ability to practice their Shiva-bhakti traditions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sivalingayya Channabasavayya Nandimath|title=A handbook of V\u012bra\u015baivism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4w0aAAAAMAAJ|year =1979|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=xxiii}}</ref><ref name=\"Ishwaran pp. 72\u201382\">{{cite journal | last=Ishwaran | first=K. | title=Bhakti Tradition and Modernization: The Case of Lingayatism | journal=African and Asian Studies | publisher=Brill | volume=15 | issue=1 | year=1980 | doi= 10.1177/002190968001500106| pages=72\u201382}}, Quote: \"From the point of view of the emergence of Lingayatism as a militant religious movement, the reign of one of these kings of Karnataka, Bijjala II (1100-1167) is significant.

However, states Schouten, the early texts of Lingayats give different accounts on who ordered the assassination leading to doubts about the trustworthiness of these historic texts.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=5 with footnote 3}}\n\n===Temples and rites-of-passage===\nVirashaivas believe that the human body is a temple. In addition, they have continued to build the community halls and Shaiva temple traditions of South India. Their temples include Shiva linga in the sanctum, a sitting Nandi facing the linga, with mandapa and other features. However, the prayers and offerings are not led by [[Brahmin]] priests but by Lingayat priests.<ref name=\"Srinivas1998p42\"/> The temple format is simpler than those of Jains and Hindus found in north Karnataka.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Julia A.

There is only about one case per million per year. DFSP is a [[fibrosarcoma]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000028732|dermatofibrosarcoma}}</ref> more precisely a [[cutaneous]] [[soft tissue sarcoma]]. In many respects, the disease behaves as a [[benign]] tumor, but in 2\u20135% of cases it can [[metastasis|metastasize]], so it should be considered to have [[malignant]] potential.  It occurs most often in adults in their thirties; it has been described congenitally, in children, and the elderly. It accounts for approximately 2\u20136% of soft tissue sarcoma cancers.\n\n==Presentation==\nDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can begin as a minor firm area of skin most commonly about  to 1 to 5&nbsp;cm in diameter. It can resemble a bruise, birthmark, or pimple. It is a slow growing tumor and is usually found on the torso but can also be found on the arms, legs, head and neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans|title= Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans}}</ref> About 90% of DFSPs are low grade sarcomas. About 10% are mixed; they contain a high-grade sarcomatous component (DFSP-FS); therefore, they are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas. DFSPs rarely lead to a [[metastasis]] (fewer than 5% do metastasise), but DFSPs can recur locally. DFSPs most often arise in patients who are in their thirties, but sometimes have been described in children or the elderly.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nMore than 90% of DFSP tumors have the [[chromosomal translocation]] t(17;22). The translocation fuses the [[collagen]] [[gene]] ([[COL1A1]]) with the [[PDGF|platelet-derived growth factor]] ([[PDGF]]) gene. The [[fibroblast]], the [[cell (biology)|cell]] of origin of this tumor, expresses the [[fusion gene]] in the belief that it codes for collagen. However the resulting [[fusion protein]] is processed into mature [[PDGF|platelet-derived growth factor]] which is a potent [[growth factor]]. Fibroblasts contain the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for this growth factor. Thus the cell \"thinks\" it is producing a structural [[protein]], but it actually produces a self-stimulatory [[growth signal]]. The [[cell division|cell divides]] rapidly and a tumor forms.\n\nThe tissue is often positive for [[CD34]].<ref name=\"pmid12661001\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sirvent N, Maire G, Pedeutour F |title=Genetics of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans family of tumors: from ring chromosomes to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment |journal=Genes Chromosomes Cancer |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201319 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12661001 |doi=10.1002/gcc.10202}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17950782\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Patel KU, Szabo SS, Hernandez VS, etal |title=Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans COL1A1-PDGFB fusion is identified in virtually all dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cases when investigated by newly developed multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization assays |journal=Hum.

In order to ensure that enough tissue is removed to make an accurate diagnosis, the initial biopsy of a suspected DFSP is usually done with a core needle or a surgical incision.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://sarcomahelp.org/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans.html|title= What is Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans?}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans CT cor.jpg|thumb|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the left axilla.

Mohs surgery can be extremely effective. It will remove the tumor and all related pathological cells without a wide-area excision that  may overlook sarcoma cells that have penetrated muscle tissue.\n\nThe standard of care for patients with DFSP is surgery. Usually, complete surgical resection with margins of 2 to 4&nbsp;cm (recommended) is performed. The addition of [[adjuvant]] [[radiotherapy]] (irradiation) improves local control in patients with close or positive margins during the surgery. A special surgical technique, the \"Mohs micrographic surgery\" (MMS), can be employed in patients with DFSP. MMS is technically possible if the DFSP is in an anatomically confined area. A high probability of cure of DFSP can be attained with MMS as long as the final margins are negative.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gloster HM, Harris KR, Roenigk RK |title=A comparison between Mohs micrographic surgery and wide surgical excision for the treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=82\u20137 |date=July 1996 |pmid=8682970 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Patients who have a recurrent DFSP can have further surgery, but the probability of adverse effects of surgery and/or metastasis is increased in these patients. The Mohs surgery is highly successful.\n\n[[Imatinib]] is approved for treatment. As is true for all medicinal drugs that have a name that ends in \"ib,\" imatinib is a small molecular pathway inhibitor; imatinib inhibits [[tyrosine kinase]].

There is only about one case per million per year. DFSP is a [[fibrosarcoma]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000028732|dermatofibrosarcoma}}</ref> more precisely a [[cutaneous]] [[soft tissue sarcoma]]. In many respects, the disease behaves as a [[benign]] tumor, but in 2\u20135% of cases it can [[metastasis|metastasize]], so it should be considered to have [[malignant]] potential.  It occurs most often in adults in their thirties; it has been described congenitally, in children, and the elderly. It accounts for approximately 2\u20136% of soft tissue sarcoma cancers.\n\n==Presentation==\nDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can begin as a minor firm area of skin most commonly about  to 1 to 5&nbsp;cm in diameter. It can resemble a bruise, birthmark, or pimple. It is a slow growing tumor and is usually found on the torso but can also be found on the arms, legs, head and neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans|title= Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans}}</ref> About 90% of DFSPs are low grade sarcomas. About 10% are mixed; they contain a high-grade sarcomatous component (DFSP-FS); therefore, they are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas. DFSPs rarely lead to a [[metastasis]] (fewer than 5% do metastasise), but DFSPs can recur locally. DFSPs most often arise in patients who are in their thirties, but sometimes have been described in children or the elderly.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nMore than 90% of DFSP tumors have the [[chromosomal translocation]] t(17;22). The translocation fuses the [[collagen]] [[gene]] ([[COL1A1]]) with the [[PDGF|platelet-derived growth factor]] ([[PDGF]]) gene. The [[fibroblast]], the [[cell (biology)|cell]] of origin of this tumor, expresses the [[fusion gene]] in the belief that it codes for collagen. However the resulting [[fusion protein]] is processed into mature [[PDGF|platelet-derived growth factor]] which is a potent [[growth factor]]. Fibroblasts contain the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for this growth factor. Thus the cell \"thinks\" it is producing a structural [[protein]], but it actually produces a self-stimulatory [[growth signal]]. The [[cell division|cell divides]] rapidly and a tumor forms.\n\nThe tissue is often positive for [[CD34]].<ref name=\"pmid12661001\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sirvent N, Maire G, Pedeutour F |title=Genetics of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans family of tumors: from ring chromosomes to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment |journal=Genes Chromosomes Cancer |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201319 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12661001 |doi=10.1002/gcc.10202}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17950782\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Patel KU, Szabo SS, Hernandez VS, etal |title=Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans COL1A1-PDGFB fusion is identified in virtually all dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cases when investigated by newly developed multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization assays |journal=Hum.

In order to ensure that enough tissue is removed to make an accurate diagnosis, the initial biopsy of a suspected DFSP is usually done with a core needle or a surgical incision.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://sarcomahelp.org/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans.html|title= What is Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans?}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans CT cor.jpg|thumb|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the left axilla.

Mohs surgery can be extremely effective. It will remove the tumor and all related pathological cells without a wide-area excision that  may overlook sarcoma cells that have penetrated muscle tissue.\n\nThe standard of care for patients with DFSP is surgery. Usually, complete surgical resection with margins of 2 to 4&nbsp;cm (recommended) is performed. The addition of [[adjuvant]] [[radiotherapy]] (irradiation) improves local control in patients with close or positive margins during the surgery. A special surgical technique, the \"Mohs micrographic surgery\" (MMS), can be employed in patients with DFSP. MMS is technically possible if the DFSP is in an anatomically confined area. A high probability of cure of DFSP can be attained with MMS as long as the final margins are negative.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gloster HM, Harris KR, Roenigk RK |title=A comparison between Mohs micrographic surgery and wide surgical excision for the treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=82\u20137 |date=July 1996 |pmid=8682970 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Patients who have a recurrent DFSP can have further surgery, but the probability of adverse effects of surgery and/or metastasis is increased in these patients. The Mohs surgery is highly successful.\n\n[[Imatinib]] is approved for treatment. As is true for all medicinal drugs that have a name that ends in \"ib,\" imatinib is a small molecular pathway inhibitor; imatinib inhibits [[tyrosine kinase]].

In order to determine and mitigate risk, Merrill found it necessary to conduct tests on building materials. Upon seeing a growing potential in his field, Merrill stayed in [[Chicago]] to found Underwriters Laboratories.<ref name=\"UL History\" />\n\nMerrill soon went to work developing standards, launching tests, designing equipment and uncovering hazards.  Aside from his work at UL, Merrill served as the [[National Fire Protection Association]]'s secretary-treasurer (1903\u20131909) and president (1910\u20131912) and was an active member of the Chicago Board and Union Committee.
