A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}The series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |DirectedBy = {{TableTBA|N/A}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]].\n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

collectors such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals. A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}The series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |DirectedBy = {{TableTBA|N/A}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]].\n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

There were many older girls in this cycle, as 9 out of the 13 contestants were 21 years old and over, while Jade was the only 26-year-old contestant since Robyn Manning of [[America's Next Top Model (season 1)|cycle 1]].\n| LineColor       = 20613C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 61\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = The Girls Go Bald\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = The girls were taken to Bel Age hotel for an interview challenge with Janice Dickinson. Nnenna won the challenge due to her personality and chose Jade, Gina, and Sara to be the first four to enter the house to choose their bedrooms. The rest of the contestants moved into their house in Los Angeles with four fashion-inspired rooms and one \"Top Model\" room. Jade claimed she was \"the undiscovered supermodel\" and declared herself the front runner of the competition. They had dinner together and Gina got over drunk in alcoholism. The girls arrived at Warren Tricomi salon and thought they were having makeovers and believed that they would all be shaved bald as a way to level the competition for the photoshoot, when in fact they were fitted with skull caps and posed wearing Swarovski crystals in an array of mannequin heads. Many of the girls' photos impressed the judges, particularly Kari, Danielle and Sara, who Tyra commended by saying her photo was \"one of the best photos in the history of America's Next Top Model.\" Furonda and Kathy landed in the bottom two, but Kathy was eliminated over Furonda, (whose photo Tyra said was the worst in the group) because the judges felt that Kathy looked lost in her photo and because the judges didn't feel she had model potential.\n\n*'''Featured photographers:''' Jay Lawrence Goldman and Pascal Demeester\n*'''Special guests:''' [[Janice Dickinson]], [[\u00c8ve Salvail]], [[Todd Newton]], Trish Moreno, [[Rolanda Watts]], Trey Smith, Tina Frazier, and Sarah Gold\n| LineColor       = 20613C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|America's Next Top Model (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 62\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Girl Who is a True Miss Diva\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|15}}\n| ShortSummary    = The remaining 12 contestants were taken back to Warren Tricomi salon and got their makeovers. During the makeover process, Jay spoke with each of the girls to help them to establish their individual styles, Jade thought she looked bad in short hair and wanted to choose long hair extensions instead. The following day, they participated in the Gen Art Fashion Show and they had to embody in a clothing challenge. Nnenna won her second challenge for her interpretation of the \"new African queen,\" and once again chose Jade and Gina to accompany her for a $5,000 shopping spree at Nanette Lepore. She chose these two because they did not get along and hoped the interaction would help their relationship.\n\nFor the photoshoot, the contestants posed with ice sculptures. Many girls did well, especially Danielle and Kari. Furonda was commended for her improvement, and Brooke's high fashion look and photo earned her the first call-out. Jade and Wendy ended up in the bottom two.

Camping World operates over 130 retail locations in 36 states, featuring thousands of products for RVs, camping, towing, and outdoor living; making Camping World the one-stop-shop for everything RV. Camping World also has over 100 service and collision centers featuring 1900 bays, 1,600 technicians and detail and refurbishment centers. \n \nCamping World is headquartered in Lincolnshire, IL and is headed by CEO Marcus Lemonis. In October of 2016 Camping World became a publicly traded company, raising $251 million in an IPO. Earlier that year Camping World acquired the sponsor rights to Camping World Stadium in Orlando, where the Camping World Bowl is played annually. Camping World has also sponsored the NASCAR truck series since 2009, and in 2017 reached a sponsorship agreement with Major League Baseball.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ford E-Series RV.jpg|thumb|[[Ford E-Series]] RV.]]\n\nCamping World began in 1966 with a small store in [[Beech Bend Park]], an [[amusement park]] outside of Bowling Green which billed its [[campground]] as the world's largest. Campers at the park were requesting a store where they could buy supplies, so David Garvin\u2014son of the park's owner\u2014took out a loan and opened the store. Garvin amassed a large customer list as the years went by, which proved to be a windfall later when he added a mail-order division to the company. That division thrived, fueling the company's growth for years to come.\n\nIn 1997, Garvin sold the company to the current owners, [[Good Sam Enterprises]] (formerly Affinity Group), of [[Ventura, California]].\n\nIn 2005, Garvin announced plans for a huge development near [[Franklin, Kentucky]] called \"Garvin's\". The development, described by Garvin as \"a combination of [[Disney World]], Camping World and [[Bass Pro Shops]]\", will feature a large Camping World store with RV 250 service bays; a five-story, 650,000 square foot (60,000 m\u00b2) permanent RV trade show and exhibition area; a \"free range\" campground with dry-camping sites; a camping [[museum]]; and much more. Due to the recession however the venture never got off the ground and much of the land proposed for development was sold at auction in October 2011.<ref name=\"tdn312\">{{cite news | url=http://www.bgdailynews.com/news/garvin-land-along-i--auctioned/article_d8bcfac6-de37-5beb-ab8c-601e94f1935f.html | title=Garvin land along I-65 auctioned | work=[[The Daily News (Kentucky)|The Daily News]] | date=March 17, 2012 | accessdate=September 8, 2013| author=Minor, Robyn L.}}</ref>\n\nIn early October 2016 Camping World raised $251 million in an initial public offering.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.

When he joins O'Reilly's fold, he must first prove his loyalty to the \"[[Wall Street (1987 film)|greed is good]]\" ethos.\n\n==Plot==\n''[This section is a rough translation from German. It has been generated by a computer. Please help to enhance the translation. It is from the German-language article that is under \"Deutsch\" in the \"languages\" sidebar.]''\n\nThe [[CEO]] of a bank, Simon O'Reily ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]), becomes aware of the mathematician Jim Doyle ([[David Wenham]]), whose software makes it possible to predict stock market trends. Doyle is hired by O'Reily and supplied with the best [[computer hardware]]. He enters into a relationship with his colleague Michelle Roberts, who views O'Reily's business activities critically.\n\nMeanwhile, the couple Diane and Wayne Davis, who took out a loan in a foreign currency at the bank, become insolvent. The son of the couple is found dead after a meeting with the deliverer of the eviction notice. The Davises sue the bank on the grounds that they were not informed about the risks of a loan in foreign currency. O'Reily demands a proof of loyalty from Doyle, requiring Doyle to  [[perjury|falsely state]] in court that he was present as an intern in the bank's loan counseling of the Davises and that Wayne Davis was sufficiently informed. That causes the Davises to lose their lawsuit.\n\nDoyle informs his boss that a [[stock market crash]] would soon occur. Roberts finds out in Doyle's hometown that his real name is not Jim Doyle; the bank had terminated his father's credit, whereupon his father committed suicide. A man who watches Roberts on behalf of O'Reily learns the truth and warns O'Reily. O'Reily wants to stop the bank's stock sale, but right now Wayne Davis breaks into O'Reily's house to shoot him. O'Reily offers him two million dollars if Davis allows him to make a phone call. Davis realizes that it should be a very important call for the bank; He destroys the house's power-box to stop this important phone-call, which is intended to warn the bank of Doyle's plans, and leaves the estate.\n\nStock prices initially perform as expected, but then they rise instead of falling. The bank goes bankrupt after losing $50 billion. Doyle leaves the country. He asks Roberts to come after him before departure, which she refuses.\n\nThe married couple Davis bring an account statement at an ATM, on the unexpected $727,000 credits - a reference to the opening credits - are. They want to clarify the matter in the neighboring bank branch, but this is one of the numerous branches, which were closed by order of O'Reily. They decide to keep the money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Wenham]] as Jim Doyle\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Simon O'Reily\n* [[Mitchell Butel]] as Stephen\n* [[Greg Stone]] as Todd Hayes\n* Kazuhiro Muroyama as Toshio\n* Stephen Leeder as Billy\n\n==Reception==\n''The Bank'' grossed $2,515,917 at the box office in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|title=Australian Films at the Australian Box Office|publisher=[[Film Victoria]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218045303/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|archivedate=18 February 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref> <!-- which is equivalent to $3,144,896\nin 2009 dollars.

When he joins O'Reilly's fold, he must first prove his loyalty to the \"[[Wall Street (1987 film)|greed is good]]\" ethos.\n\n==Plot==\n''[This section is a rough translation from German. It has been generated by a computer. Please help to enhance the translation. It is from the German-language article that is under \"Deutsch\" in the \"languages\" sidebar.]''\n\nThe [[CEO]] of a bank, Simon O'Reily ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]), becomes aware of the mathematician Jim Doyle ([[David Wenham]]), whose software makes it possible to predict stock market trends. Doyle is hired by O'Reily and supplied with the best [[computer hardware]]. He enters into a relationship with his colleague Michelle Roberts, who views O'Reily's business activities critically.\n\nMeanwhile, the couple Diane and Wayne Davis, who took out a loan in a foreign currency at the bank, become insolvent. The son of the couple is found dead after a meeting with the deliverer of the eviction notice. The Davises sue the bank on the grounds that they were not informed about the risks of a loan in foreign currency. O'Reily demands a proof of loyalty from Doyle, requiring Doyle to  [[perjury|falsely state]] in court that he was present as an intern in the bank's loan counseling of the Davises and that Wayne Davis was sufficiently informed. That causes the Davises to lose their lawsuit.\n\nDoyle informs his boss that a [[stock market crash]] would soon occur. Roberts finds out in Doyle's hometown that his real name is not Jim Doyle; the bank had terminated his father's credit, whereupon his father committed suicide. A man who watches Roberts on behalf of O'Reily learns the truth and warns O'Reily. O'Reily wants to stop the bank's stock sale, but right now Wayne Davis breaks into O'Reily's house to shoot him. O'Reily offers him two million dollars if Davis allows him to make a phone call. Davis realizes that it should be a very important call for the bank; He destroys the house's power-box to stop this important phone-call, which is intended to warn the bank of Doyle's plans, and leaves the estate.\n\nStock prices initially perform as expected, but then they rise instead of falling. The bank goes bankrupt after losing $50 billion. Doyle leaves the country. He asks Roberts to come after him before departure, which she refuses.\n\nThe married couple Davis bring an account statement at an ATM, on the unexpected $727,000 credits - a reference to the opening credits - are. They want to clarify the matter in the neighboring bank branch, but this is one of the numerous branches, which were closed by order of O'Reily. They decide to keep the money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Wenham]] as Jim Doyle\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Simon O'Reily\n* [[Mitchell Butel]] as Stephen\n* [[Greg Stone]] as Todd Hayes\n* Kazuhiro Muroyama as Toshio\n* Stephen Leeder as Billy\n\n==Reception==\n''The Bank'' grossed $2,515,917 at the box office in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|title=Australian Films at the Australian Box Office|publisher=[[Film Victoria]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218045303/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|archivedate=18 February 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref> <!-- which is equivalent to $3,144,896\nin 2009 dollars.

Yarmouth is the [[shire town]] of [[Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth County]] and is the largest population centre in the region.\n\nLong connected to [[fishing]] due to its proximity to [[Georges Bank]], the town is located in the heart of the world's largest [[lobster fishing]] grounds and as a result receives Canada's largest lobster landings each year.<ref>[http://www.townofyarmouth.ca/ Town of Yarmouth website]</ref>\n\n==History==\nOriginally inhabited by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], the region was known as \"Keespongwitk\" meaning \"Lands End\" due to its geographic isolation being located at the southwestern tip of the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]].<ref>[http://bayoffundy.com/articles/yarmouth-lands-end/ Yarmouth: Lands End - Bay of Fundy]</ref><ref name=\"Names\"/>\n\nThe region may have possibly been visited by [[Leif Ericson]]. An object known as the [[Yarmouth Runic Stone]] was found at the nearby village of [[Overton, Nova Scotia|Overton]] in 1812. It was interpreted by some to have been carved by Ericson, while others feel the markings are natural scratches gradually enhanced over the years. The stone is preserved at the [[Yarmouth County Museum & Archives]].\n\n===European settlement===\nThe region was visited in 1604 by [[Samuel de Champlain]], who named it \"Cap-Fourchu\", meaning \"forked or cloven cape.\"<ref name=\"Names\">{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Thomas J. |title= Place-names of the Province of Nova Scotia |url= https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofprov00browuoft#page/n160/mode/1up |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia|publisher= Royal Print & Litho.|page=157 |date=1922}}</ref> The first Europeans to make a settlement on these shores were the French Acadians.

Despite the American Privateer raids in the [[Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (1775)]], the inhabitants still sheltered American prisoners after the [[Battle off Yarmouth (1777)]].\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], substantial numbers of [[United Empire Loyalist]]s arrived in 1785.\n\n[[File:View of Yarmouth from Milton, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|View of Yarmouth from Milton, Nova Scotia, by Sarah Bond Farish, 1829.]]\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n[[File:Yarmouthmuseum2.JPG|thumb|left|House flags of Yarmouth shipping companies and ship portraits at the [[Yarmouth County Museum]]]]\n\nThrough the 19th century the town was a major [[shipbuilding]] centre, at one point boasting more registered tonnage [[per capita]] than any other port in the world.<ref>[http://bayoffundy.com/articles/yarmouth-lands-end/ Yarmouth: Lands End]</ref> From 1874 to 1885, Yarmouth was the second largest port of registry in Canada following [[Saint John, New Brunswick]].

[[John Patch]], the son of a Yarmouth sea captain, developed and built one of the first modern [[screw propeller]] driven ships in 1832 (4 years before [[John Ericsson]]'s patent). First demonstrated in Yarmouth Harbour during the summer of 1833, Patch was unsuccessful in a [[patent]] application in that year, but he continued to improve his propeller and received an American patent in 1849<ref>Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions'' Goose Lane Publishing (2001) p. 58-59</ref> which drew praise in American scientific circles.<ref>[http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033 \"Patch's Propeller\", ''Scientific American'', Vol. 4, No. 5 (October 10, 1848)  p. 33, featured in ''The Archimedes Screw'' website retrieved 31 January 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174319/http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller.

The town's first railway was the locally owned [[Western Counties Railway]] which was built from Yarmouth to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] in the 1870s.  It eventually was merged into the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]] (DAR), with a network extending into the [[Annapolis Valley]], [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]]; the DAR later became a subsidiary of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR).  The [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] was built along the south shore linking Yarmouth with [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]], [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]] and [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in the early 20th century; the H&SW was eventually merged into the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR).  While iron-hulled steamships had led to the decline of Yarmouth's once-thriving wooden shipbuilding industry, they also made the port a vital connection between Nova Scotia's rail lines and steamships destined for [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]].  Rail services were abandoned to Yarmouth in stages, beginning in 1982 (CNR) and ending in 1990 (CPR).\n\n===Steamships and ferries===\n[[Tourism]] has been a major industry in Yarmouth since the 1880s when [[Loran Ellis Baker]] founded the Yarmouth Steamship Company. Steamship and railway promotion based in Yarmouth created the first tourism marketing in Nova Scotia.<ref>Jay White, [http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/tourism/early.asp?Language=English \"Canada's Ocean Playground: The Tourism Industry in Nova Scotia, 1870-1970\"], ''Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management''</ref>\nBaker's steamships operated between Yarmouth and Boston until 1900, when the company was purchased by the Dominion Atlantic Railway. The DAR and [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] offered connections for passengers arriving in Yarmouth with steamship services operating to New York City and Boston.\n\nIn 1939, examiners at Yarmouth's Merchant Marine Institution made seafaring history by issuing master's papers to [[Molly Kool]], the first female ship captain in the Western World.\n\nSteamship connections between Yarmouth and Boston / New York were maintained by [[Eastern Steamship Lines]] but were suspended with the start of [[World War II]]; the [[SS Yarmouth Castle|SS ''Yarmouth Castle'']] was one of many vessels which served this route. The service resumed a few years after the war with the S.S. Yarmouth, under the same company.  This service continued into the mid 1950s and was then replaced with the M.V. Bluenose.\n\n====CNR, CN Marine and Marine Atlantic====\nFollowing the war, as the economy of western Nova Scotia improved, the need for a year-round daily service was made evident. The service was needed as a more timely route for transport of goods between markets in Nova Scotia and the United States. Demand increased for passenger traffic as well.  This led citizens of southwestern Nova Scotia to undertake an extensive lobbying effort with the federal government to establish a [[ferry]] service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] connecting Yarmouth with a port in New England.  In 1949 the [[Canadian Maritime Commission]] began to study the possibility of a ferry service connecting with a port in the US. After some controversy as to whether to return to the traditional Boston or New York service, a decision was made to focus the effort on a service from Yarmouth to [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]].  In 1954 the federal government contracted [[Davie Shipbuilding]] to construct [[MV Bluenose|MV ''Bluenose'']] which was launched in 1955 and began service in 1956 under the management of [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) and later (1977-1982) under the management of a federal [[Crown corporation]] named [[CN Marine]].\n\nIn 1978 CN Marine started operating [[MV Marine Evangeline|MV ''Marine Evangeline'']] on a service from Yarmouth to [[Portland, Maine]].  In 1982 the old ''Bluenose'' was retired from the Bar Harbor service and sold.  CN Marine replaced her with a newer vessel [[MV Stena Jutlandica|MV ''Stena Jutlandica'']] which was renamed MV ''Bluenose'' to prevent confusion in tourism marketing literature.\n\nIn 1986 CN Marine was reorganized into the Crown corporation [[Marine Atlantic]] and in 1997 the federal government decided to end its financial support for the Gulf of Maine ferry service, soliciting proposals from private sector ferry companies to operate the route.\n\n====Lion Ferry, Prince of Fundy Cruises, Scotia Prince Cruises====\nThe growth of post-war automobile-based tourism saw the provincial government encourage additional ferry service with New England, a region with many family connections to the [[Maritimes]] dating to the 18th century and which accelerated during the first half of the 20th century.  In 1970 the MV ''Bluenose'' service operated by CNR was joined by the [[MS Prince of Fundy|MS ''Prince of Fundy'']] on a route connecting Yarmouth with [[Portland, Maine]] operated by [[Lion Ferry]].  The service was supplemented between 1973-1976 by [[MS Bolero|MS ''Bolero'']], however by 1976 both vessels were replaced by the [[MS Caribe|MS ''Caribe'']].  Lion Ferry sold Yarmouth's second ferry service to [[Scotia Prince Cruises|Prince of Fundy Cruises]] who purchased [[MS Stena Olympica|MS ''Stena Olympica'']] and renamed it MS ''Scotia Prince''.  The service underwent another ownership change in 2000 and was renamed [[Scotia Prince Cruises]].  In 2004 the company discovered toxic mould in its Portland terminal, owned by the City of Portland, canceling its 2005 season.  The City of Portland subsequently canceled the company's lease and evicted Scotia Prince Cruises, thus ending this ferry service.\n\n====Bay Ferries====\n[[File:The cat ferry.jpg|thumb|HSC ''The Cat'' in Yarmouth Harbour]]\nIn 1997 [[Bay Ferries]], a subsidiary of [[Northumberland Ferries Limited]], was the successful bidder for the federal government's Gulf of Maine ferry service.  Only the operating licence was transferred as well as the right to be the primary user of the federal government-owned ferry terminals in Yarmouth and Bar Harbor; the service would receive no subsidy from the federal government.  Bay Ferries purchased MV ''Bluenose'' from Marine Atlantic and used that vessel for the remainder of the 1997 season before selling it.\n\nIn 1998 Bay Ferries introduced the first [[high speed catamaran]] passenger-vehicle ferry service in North America when it purchased [[HSC INCAT 046|HSC ''Incat 046'']] from [[Incat]] in an aggressive bid to expand the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service.  Throughout the 1990s the market for ferry services in southwestern Nova Scotia was threatened by significant expansions of 4-lane expressways in northern Nova Scotia and across southern [[New Brunswick]] so it was theorized that the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service could maintain market share if the ferry voyage time was shortened.  Marketed as \"The Cat\", the use of the ferry service grew largely due to Bay Ferries' investment and the novelty of riding the ultra-modern high speed catamaran.  In 2002 Bay Ferries traded in HSC ''Incat 046'' for a larger vessel [[HSC The Cat|HSC ''The Cat'']] which was also marketed as \"The Cat\".  Beginning in 2003, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' during the winter months on services in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nFollowing the end of the service offered by [[Scotia Prince Cruises]] in 2004, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' in 2006 between Yarmouth to Portland, in addition to Bar Harbor; the old Portland ferry terminal being replaced by the newly built [[Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal]].  Following a decline in American tourism to Nova Scotia, as well as record-high fuel prices, Bay Ferries sought subsidies from the federal and provincial governments for its Gulf of Maine ferry service.  The federal government refused to provide a subsidy, having removed itself from operating such a service in 1997.  However, the provincial government offered a subsidy to cover the operating loss and this was subsequently provided in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In 2009 the provincial government canceled the subsidy and Bay Ferries announced in December 2009 that it was ending its ferry service and sold the vessel.<ref name=\"ferry\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/12/18/ns-yarmouth-ferry-ends.html |title=Yarmouth ferry service ends. |publisher=cbc.ca |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 | work=CBC News}}</ref>\n\n====Nova Star Cruises====\nIn 2013 the provincial government posted a request for proposals for re-establishing a Yarmouth - Maine ferry service, stating that a successful proponent would receive a $21 million subsidy over a 7-year period.  In September 2013 it was announced that [[Nova Star Cruises]] was the successful proponent and in November 2013 it was confirmed that the service would start May 1, 2014 with the [[MV Nova Star|MV ''Nova Star'']] offering daily round trips between Yarmouth and Portland.  Nova Star Cruises also announced it was examining the possibility of using the vessel during the winter months on a service between [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] bypassing the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]]. Nova Star's contract to provide ferry services between Yarmouth and Portland was not renewed for 2016.<ref><http://novastarcruises.com/></ref>\n\n====Return of ''The Cat''====\n[[File:The Cat ferry Yarmouth 2016.jpg|thumb|''The Cat'' leaving Yarmouth Harbour in 2016]]\nOn March 24, 2016, [[Bay Ferries|Bay Ferries Limited]] announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year [[Bareboat charter|charter]] of [[HST-2]].  The vessel will be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth. The service and vessel will be branded as ''The CAT'' to align with the previous branding used by Bay Ferries. The vessel underwent a refit at a shipyard in [[South Carolina]] and the service began on June 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/05/25/cat-ferry-expected-to-start-service-mid-june/|title=The Cat expected to start ferry service in Maine in mid-June - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram|date=25 May 2016|work=pressherald.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalmariner.com/Web-Bulletin-2016/US-Navy-to-lease-high-speed-transport-to-Bay-Ferries/|title=US Navy to lease high-speed transport to Bay Ferries - Professional Mariner - Web Bulletin 2016|work=professionalmariner.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/06/16/news/portland/high-speed-ferry-begins-service-in-portland/|title=High-speed ferry begins service in Portland|first=Cbs|last=13|work=bangordailynews.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the first year of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yarmouth was selected as the location for a [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] (BCATP) facility. [[RCAF Station Yarmouth]] was originally opened in 1940 as three separate training sites (the East Camp, the West Camp and the Air Base).\n\nThe East Camp was home to a detachment of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s No. 34 [[Operational conversion unit|Operational Training Unit]] (from [[RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge]]), who trained bomber crews, as well as the [[Royal Navy]]'s No. 1 Naval Air Gunners School who were located at Yarmouth from 1 January 1943 to 30 March 1945.\n\nThe West Camp was home to an [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] Anti-Submarine Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron and several Eastern Air Command Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons, such as [[No. 162 Squadron RCAF|162 Squadron]].\n\nThe Air Base was home to the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery, various RCAF and RAF Bomber Squadrons and an Army Co-operation Reconnaissance Flight. Its primary function was as an administrative and logistical support base to the RAF and RCAF squadrons in the area, in addition to providing a Weather Information Section, an Armament Section and a [[Shooting range|firing range]].\n\nA [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson bomber]] from Royal Canadian Air Force Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron 113 in Yarmouth became the first aircraft of RCAF's Eastern Air Command to destroy a submarine, sinking [[German submarine U-754|U-754]] about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} south of Yarmouth on July 31, 1942. The sinking resulted in 43 casualties and no survivors.<ref>''The Creation of a National Air Force'' W.A.B. Douglas, (University of Toronto Press, 1986) p. 520</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller installations associated with RCAF Station Yarmouth were located in southwestern Nova Scotia, including a [[bombing range]] at [[Port Maitland, Nova Scotia|Port Maitland]], a fuel depot at [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]], and radar detachments at [[Plymouth, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Plymouth]], [[Tusket, Nova Scotia|Tusket]], [[Bear Point, Nova Scotia|Bear Point]], [[Port Mouton, Nova Scotia|Port Mouton]] and [[Rockville, Nova Scotia|Rockville]]. In 1944, a detachment of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] briefly came to Yarmouth to test the effectiveness of a [[blimp]] service. After a crash, the RCAF decided against this venture.\n\nRCAF Station Yarmouth closed in 1945. The airfield was sold to the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]] in 1946 and became the [[Yarmouth Airport]]. A [[Canadian Army]] training camp (known as Camp 60) on Parade Street also provided basic and artillery training for 20,000 soldiers during the war.<ref>''RCAF Yarmouth East camp/West Camp'' Hank Reed, (East Camp Veterans, Yarmouth, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing boats in Yarmouth]]\n\n==Culture==\nThe Western Branch of the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] is located in Yarmouth. The town is also home to the [[Yarmouth County Museum & Archives]] which preserves the history of the town and surrounding county and operates the Killam Brothers building on the waterfront. The Firefighters Museum, part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system and the privately run Sweeney Fisheries Museum are also located in Yarmouth.\n\nThe [[Izaak Walton Killam]] Memorial house, founded in 1963, serves as the town's public library.  It is the largest branch of [[Western Counties Regional Library]] and houses the regional library's headquarters.\n\nThe Yarmouth Arts Regional Council was established in 1974, under the leadership of Lydia Davison, a local music teacher. Over the next five years, with the assistance of the [[Canada Council]] and many volunteers, the Yarmouth Arts Regional Centre (Th'YARC) was constructed on the site of a former garage on Parade Street. Th'YARC continues to operate to this day, with the 350-seat Lydia Davison Theatre, an art gallery and a print-making shop.\n\n[[File:Canada-Yarmouth01.jpg|thumb|left|The Victorian [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]] Eakin/Hatfield House in Yarmouth]]\n\nA popular but unsupported cultural belief in Yarmouth holds that the American composer [[Meredith Willson]] wrote his well-known song \"[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]\" while staying in Yarmouth's Grand Hotel.<ref>[http://www.guestlovitt.ca/christmas.htm It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas: Was it written in Yarmouth?]</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, a record [[Shortfin mako shark|mako shark]] was caught off the coast of Yarmouth during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble. It weighed {{convert|1082|lb|abbr=on}} and set a new Canadian record. It is considered one of the largest mako sharks ever caught.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/travel/story.html?id=e88d6269-9547-489b-a641-6419e99e95b7 Mako Shark caught off Yarmouth]</ref>\n\n[[Seafest]] is an annual 7 day festival organized since 1979.\n\n==Buildings and structures==\nYarmouth is known for some of the most exuberant examples of Victorian houses styles in the [[Maritimes]], a legacy of the wealthy captains and shipowners of the town's seafaring Golden Age.<ref>Mark Myers & Margaret McBurney, ''Atlantic Hearths: Early Homes and families of Nova Scotia'', University of Toronto Press (1994), p. 160</ref> A heritage district preserves several blocks of these residences, including the Lovitt House and Eakin/Hatfield House. On the waterfront, two historic warehouses survive from the sailing era, the Killam Brothers and Parker-Eakin's buildings, each with an associated wharf, which are the focal points of summer waterfront events.\n\nYarmouth's Main Street is marked by several distinctive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] commercial buildings such as the turreted Yarmouth Block Building.<ref>Elizabeth Pacey and Alvin Comiter, ''Landmarks: Historic Buildings in Nova Scotia'', Nimbus (1994) pp. 136-137</ref> The largest building in the town is a 1970s hotel, the Rodd Grand Hotel. It is built on the site of the original Grand Hotel, a [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] hotel which was the town's landmark for many years.\n\nA landmark for Yarmouth Harbour is the large Cape Forchu Lighthouse which is located a few kilometers away at the [[headland]] of [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia|Cape Forchu]], the peninsula that guards Yarmouth Harbour. The tall \"apple core\" style is a notable example of modernist style light tower.<ref>[http://nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=61&M=IP&N=3 \"Cape Forchu Lighthouse\", Nova Scotian Lighthouse Preservation Society website]</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n{{climate chart\n| Yarmouth\n|-6.9 |  0.8 |  127.3\n|-6.5|  1.1 |  101.8\n|-3.4|  4.0 | 115.5\n|1.2|  9.0 | 101.4\n|5.5|  13.9 | 100.9\n|9.6| 18.0 | 94.8\n|12.7| 20.9 | 88.4\n|12.9| 21.1 | 84.3\n|10.0| 18.2 |  94.9\n|5.6|  13.3 | 112.4\n|1.6|  8.7 |  139.3\n|-3.5|  3.8 |  131.8\n| float = left\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN yarmouth\">{{cite web| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6516&lang=e&amp;StationName=Yarmouth&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1| title = Yarmouth A | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | publisher = Environment Canada | language = English, French | accessdate = 28 September 2015}}</ref>}}\nYarmouth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfb'') of the maritime influence, typical of climates surrounded by the sea but close to large continents such as [[Southern Norway|southern Norway]] and [[Hokkaido|coastal Hokkaido]] but with latitude variations.

[[John Patch]], the son of a Yarmouth sea captain, developed and built one of the first modern [[screw propeller]] driven ships in 1832 (4 years before [[John Ericsson]]'s patent). First demonstrated in Yarmouth Harbour during the summer of 1833, Patch was unsuccessful in a [[patent]] application in that year, but he continued to improve his propeller and received an American patent in 1849<ref>Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions'' Goose Lane Publishing (2001) p. 58-59</ref> which drew praise in American scientific circles.<ref>[http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033 \"Patch's Propeller\", ''Scientific American'', Vol. 4, No. 5 (October 10, 1848)  p. 33, featured in ''The Archimedes Screw'' website retrieved 31 January 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174319/http://www.cogulus.com/cgi-bin/viewer.cgi?type=writings&file=1848_10_033|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller.

The town's first railway was the locally owned [[Western Counties Railway]] which was built from Yarmouth to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] in the 1870s.  It eventually was merged into the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]] (DAR), with a network extending into the [[Annapolis Valley]], [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]]; the DAR later became a subsidiary of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR).  The [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] was built along the south shore linking Yarmouth with [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]], [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]] and [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in the early 20th century; the H&SW was eventually merged into the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR).  While iron-hulled steamships had led to the decline of Yarmouth's once-thriving wooden shipbuilding industry, they also made the port a vital connection between Nova Scotia's rail lines and steamships destined for [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]].  Rail services were abandoned to Yarmouth in stages, beginning in 1982 (CNR) and ending in 1990 (CPR).\n\n===Steamships and ferries===\n[[Tourism]] has been a major industry in Yarmouth since the 1880s when [[Loran Ellis Baker]] founded the Yarmouth Steamship Company. Steamship and railway promotion based in Yarmouth created the first tourism marketing in Nova Scotia.<ref>Jay White, [http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/tourism/early.asp?Language=English \"Canada's Ocean Playground: The Tourism Industry in Nova Scotia, 1870-1970\"], ''Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management''</ref>\nBaker's steamships operated between Yarmouth and Boston until 1900, when the company was purchased by the Dominion Atlantic Railway. The DAR and [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]] offered connections for passengers arriving in Yarmouth with steamship services operating to New York City and Boston.\n\nIn 1939, examiners at Yarmouth's Merchant Marine Institution made seafaring history by issuing master's papers to [[Molly Kool]], the first female ship captain in the Western World.\n\nSteamship connections between Yarmouth and Boston / New York were maintained by [[Eastern Steamship Lines]] but were suspended with the start of [[World War II]]; the [[SS Yarmouth Castle|SS ''Yarmouth Castle'']] was one of many vessels which served this route. The service resumed a few years after the war with the S.S. Yarmouth, under the same company.  This service continued into the mid 1950s and was then replaced with the M.V. Bluenose.\n\n====CNR, CN Marine and Marine Atlantic====\nFollowing the war, as the economy of western Nova Scotia improved, the need for a year-round daily service was made evident. The service was needed as a more timely route for transport of goods between markets in Nova Scotia and the United States. Demand increased for passenger traffic as well.  This led citizens of southwestern Nova Scotia to undertake an extensive lobbying effort with the federal government to establish a [[ferry]] service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] connecting Yarmouth with a port in New England.  In 1949 the [[Canadian Maritime Commission]] began to study the possibility of a ferry service connecting with a port in the US. After some controversy as to whether to return to the traditional Boston or New York service, a decision was made to focus the effort on a service from Yarmouth to [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]].  In 1954 the federal government contracted [[Davie Shipbuilding]] to construct [[MV Bluenose|MV ''Bluenose'']] which was launched in 1955 and began service in 1956 under the management of [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR) and later (1977-1982) under the management of a federal [[Crown corporation]] named [[CN Marine]].\n\nIn 1978 CN Marine started operating [[MV Marine Evangeline|MV ''Marine Evangeline'']] on a service from Yarmouth to [[Portland, Maine]].  In 1982 the old ''Bluenose'' was retired from the Bar Harbor service and sold.  CN Marine replaced her with a newer vessel [[MV Stena Jutlandica|MV ''Stena Jutlandica'']] which was renamed MV ''Bluenose'' to prevent confusion in tourism marketing literature.\n\nIn 1986 CN Marine was reorganized into the Crown corporation [[Marine Atlantic]] and in 1997 the federal government decided to end its financial support for the Gulf of Maine ferry service, soliciting proposals from private sector ferry companies to operate the route.\n\n====Lion Ferry, Prince of Fundy Cruises, Scotia Prince Cruises====\nThe growth of post-war automobile-based tourism saw the provincial government encourage additional ferry service with New England, a region with many family connections to the [[Maritimes]] dating to the 18th century and which accelerated during the first half of the 20th century.  In 1970 the MV ''Bluenose'' service operated by CNR was joined by the [[MS Prince of Fundy|MS ''Prince of Fundy'']] on a route connecting Yarmouth with [[Portland, Maine]] operated by [[Lion Ferry]].  The service was supplemented between 1973-1976 by [[MS Bolero|MS ''Bolero'']], however by 1976 both vessels were replaced by the [[MS Caribe|MS ''Caribe'']].  Lion Ferry sold Yarmouth's second ferry service to [[Scotia Prince Cruises|Prince of Fundy Cruises]] who purchased [[MS Stena Olympica|MS ''Stena Olympica'']] and renamed it MS ''Scotia Prince''.  The service underwent another ownership change in 2000 and was renamed [[Scotia Prince Cruises]].  In 2004 the company discovered toxic mould in its Portland terminal, owned by the City of Portland, canceling its 2005 season.  The City of Portland subsequently canceled the company's lease and evicted Scotia Prince Cruises, thus ending this ferry service.\n\n====Bay Ferries====\n[[File:The cat ferry.jpg|thumb|HSC ''The Cat'' in Yarmouth Harbour]]\nIn 1997 [[Bay Ferries]], a subsidiary of [[Northumberland Ferries Limited]], was the successful bidder for the federal government's Gulf of Maine ferry service.  Only the operating licence was transferred as well as the right to be the primary user of the federal government-owned ferry terminals in Yarmouth and Bar Harbor; the service would receive no subsidy from the federal government.  Bay Ferries purchased MV ''Bluenose'' from Marine Atlantic and used that vessel for the remainder of the 1997 season before selling it.\n\nIn 1998 Bay Ferries introduced the first [[high speed catamaran]] passenger-vehicle ferry service in North America when it purchased [[HSC INCAT 046|HSC ''Incat 046'']] from [[Incat]] in an aggressive bid to expand the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service.  Throughout the 1990s the market for ferry services in southwestern Nova Scotia was threatened by significant expansions of 4-lane expressways in northern Nova Scotia and across southern [[New Brunswick]] so it was theorized that the Yarmouth - Bar Harbor ferry service could maintain market share if the ferry voyage time was shortened.  Marketed as \"The Cat\", the use of the ferry service grew largely due to Bay Ferries' investment and the novelty of riding the ultra-modern high speed catamaran.  In 2002 Bay Ferries traded in HSC ''Incat 046'' for a larger vessel [[HSC The Cat|HSC ''The Cat'']] which was also marketed as \"The Cat\".  Beginning in 2003, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' during the winter months on services in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nFollowing the end of the service offered by [[Scotia Prince Cruises]] in 2004, Bay Ferries began operating HSC ''The Cat'' in 2006 between Yarmouth to Portland, in addition to Bar Harbor; the old Portland ferry terminal being replaced by the newly built [[Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal]].  Following a decline in American tourism to Nova Scotia, as well as record-high fuel prices, Bay Ferries sought subsidies from the federal and provincial governments for its Gulf of Maine ferry service.  The federal government refused to provide a subsidy, having removed itself from operating such a service in 1997.  However, the provincial government offered a subsidy to cover the operating loss and this was subsequently provided in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  In 2009 the provincial government canceled the subsidy and Bay Ferries announced in December 2009 that it was ending its ferry service and sold the vessel.<ref name=\"ferry\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/12/18/ns-yarmouth-ferry-ends.html |title=Yarmouth ferry service ends. |publisher=cbc.ca |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 | work=CBC News}}</ref>\n\n====Nova Star Cruises====\nIn 2013 the provincial government posted a request for proposals for re-establishing a Yarmouth - Maine ferry service, stating that a successful proponent would receive a $21 million subsidy over a 7-year period.  In September 2013 it was announced that [[Nova Star Cruises]] was the successful proponent and in November 2013 it was confirmed that the service would start May 1, 2014 with the [[MV Nova Star|MV ''Nova Star'']] offering daily round trips between Yarmouth and Portland.  Nova Star Cruises also announced it was examining the possibility of using the vessel during the winter months on a service between [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]] bypassing the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]]. Nova Star's contract to provide ferry services between Yarmouth and Portland was not renewed for 2016.<ref><http://novastarcruises.com/></ref>\n\n====Return of ''The Cat''====\n[[File:The Cat ferry Yarmouth 2016.jpg|thumb|''The Cat'' leaving Yarmouth Harbour in 2016]]\nOn March 24, 2016, [[Bay Ferries|Bay Ferries Limited]] announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year [[Bareboat charter|charter]] of [[HST-2]].  The vessel will be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service in the [[Gulf of Maine]] between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth. The service and vessel will be branded as ''The CAT'' to align with the previous branding used by Bay Ferries. The vessel underwent a refit at a shipyard in [[South Carolina]] and the service began on June 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/05/25/cat-ferry-expected-to-start-service-mid-june/|title=The Cat expected to start ferry service in Maine in mid-June - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram|date=25 May 2016|work=pressherald.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalmariner.com/Web-Bulletin-2016/US-Navy-to-lease-high-speed-transport-to-Bay-Ferries/|title=US Navy to lease high-speed transport to Bay Ferries - Professional Mariner - Web Bulletin 2016|work=professionalmariner.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/06/16/news/portland/high-speed-ferry-begins-service-in-portland/|title=High-speed ferry begins service in Portland|first=Cbs|last=13|work=bangordailynews.com|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the first year of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yarmouth was selected as the location for a [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] (BCATP) facility. [[RCAF Station Yarmouth]] was originally opened in 1940 as three separate training sites (the East Camp, the West Camp and the Air Base).\n\nThe East Camp was home to a detachment of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s No. 34 [[Operational conversion unit|Operational Training Unit]] (from [[RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge]]), who trained bomber crews, as well as the [[Royal Navy]]'s No. 1 Naval Air Gunners School who were located at Yarmouth from 1 January 1943 to 30 March 1945.\n\nThe West Camp was home to an [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] Anti-Submarine Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron and several Eastern Air Command Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons, such as [[No. 162 Squadron RCAF|162 Squadron]].\n\nThe Air Base was home to the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery, various RCAF and RAF Bomber Squadrons and an Army Co-operation Reconnaissance Flight. Its primary function was as an administrative and logistical support base to the RAF and RCAF squadrons in the area, in addition to providing a Weather Information Section, an Armament Section and a [[Shooting range|firing range]].\n\nA [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson bomber]] from Royal Canadian Air Force Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron 113 in Yarmouth became the first aircraft of RCAF's Eastern Air Command to destroy a submarine, sinking [[German submarine U-754|U-754]] about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} south of Yarmouth on July 31, 1942. The sinking resulted in 43 casualties and no survivors.<ref>''The Creation of a National Air Force'' W.A.B. Douglas, (University of Toronto Press, 1986) p. 520</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller installations associated with RCAF Station Yarmouth were located in southwestern Nova Scotia, including a [[bombing range]] at [[Port Maitland, Nova Scotia|Port Maitland]], a fuel depot at [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]], and radar detachments at [[Plymouth, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia|Plymouth]], [[Tusket, Nova Scotia|Tusket]], [[Bear Point, Nova Scotia|Bear Point]], [[Port Mouton, Nova Scotia|Port Mouton]] and [[Rockville, Nova Scotia|Rockville]]. In 1944, a detachment of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] briefly came to Yarmouth to test the effectiveness of a [[blimp]] service. After a crash, the RCAF decided against this venture.\n\nRCAF Station Yarmouth closed in 1945. The airfield was sold to the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]] in 1946 and became the [[Yarmouth Airport]]. A [[Canadian Army]] training camp (known as Camp 60) on Parade Street also provided basic and artillery training for 20,000 soldiers during the war.<ref>''RCAF Yarmouth East camp/West Camp'' Hank Reed, (East Camp Veterans, Yarmouth, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing boats in Yarmouth]]\n\n==Culture==\nThe Western Branch of the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] is located in Yarmouth. The town is also home to the [[Yarmouth County Museum & Archives]] which preserves the history of the town and surrounding county and operates the Killam Brothers building on the waterfront. The Firefighters Museum, part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system and the privately run Sweeney Fisheries Museum are also located in Yarmouth.\n\nThe [[Izaak Walton Killam]] Memorial house, founded in 1963, serves as the town's public library.  It is the largest branch of [[Western Counties Regional Library]] and houses the regional library's headquarters.\n\nThe Yarmouth Arts Regional Council was established in 1974, under the leadership of Lydia Davison, a local music teacher. Over the next five years, with the assistance of the [[Canada Council]] and many volunteers, the Yarmouth Arts Regional Centre (Th'YARC) was constructed on the site of a former garage on Parade Street. Th'YARC continues to operate to this day, with the 350-seat Lydia Davison Theatre, an art gallery and a print-making shop.\n\n[[File:Canada-Yarmouth01.jpg|thumb|left|The Victorian [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]] Eakin/Hatfield House in Yarmouth]]\n\nA popular but unsupported cultural belief in Yarmouth holds that the American composer [[Meredith Willson]] wrote his well-known song \"[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]\" while staying in Yarmouth's Grand Hotel.<ref>[http://www.guestlovitt.ca/christmas.htm It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas: Was it written in Yarmouth?]</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, a record [[Shortfin mako shark|mako shark]] was caught off the coast of Yarmouth during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble.

On the waterfront, two historic warehouses survive from the sailing era, the Killam Brothers and Parker-Eakin's buildings, each with an associated wharf, which are the focal points of summer waterfront events.\n\nYarmouth's Main Street is marked by several distinctive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] commercial buildings such as the turreted Yarmouth Block Building.<ref>Elizabeth Pacey and Alvin Comiter, ''Landmarks: Historic Buildings in Nova Scotia'', Nimbus (1994) pp. 136-137</ref> The largest building in the town is a 1970s hotel, the Rodd Grand Hotel. It is built on the site of the original Grand Hotel, a [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] hotel which was the town's landmark for many years.\n\nA landmark for Yarmouth Harbour is the large Cape Forchu Lighthouse which is located a few kilometers away at the [[headland]] of [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia|Cape Forchu]], the peninsula that guards Yarmouth Harbour.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=pTRAAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA29 \"Old Penetanguishene: Sketches of its Pioneer, Naval and Military Days\"] in ''Pioneer Papers'', No. 5. Simcoe County Pioneer and Historical Society (Barrie, ON: 1912).</ref> meaning \"land of the white rolling sands\".\n\n==History==\nAs early as [[anno Domini|AD]] 800, the [[Wyandot people]] settled in semi-permanent villages in the area. The young [[French people|French]] [[Translation|translator]], [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]], was the first European to set foot in the Penetanguishene area, some time between 1610 and 1614.\n\nIn 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]], the first [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]], visited the area and saw the location's potential as a naval base.  He wanted to use the bay to shelter [[warships]] to protect British interests on lakes Huron, Erie and Michigan.  Beginning in 1814, the British-Canadians built the [[Penetanguishene Road]] to provide the area a land route to [[Barrie]] and [[Toronto]], as it was previously accessible only by water transport along the rivers or across Georgian Bay.\n\nIn 1817, naval units from [[Michilimackinac]] and Schooner Town (near modern-day [[Wasaga Beach]]) were consolidated at the [[Penetanguishene Naval Yard]].  But, because treaty limitations with the U.S. limited both countries' naval power on the [[Great Lakes]], two British armed topsail schooners, [[HMS Tecumseth|HMS ''Tecumseth'']] and [[HMS Newash|HMS ''Newash'']] were laid up \"in ordinary\", and eventually reported to have sunk at their moorings in the harbour in 1828.  Some other small craft were headquartered in Penetanguishene for the exploration and mapping of the Great Lakes' coastline.\n\nIn 1828, the main British military establishment on the Upper Lakes moved from [[Drummond Island]] to Penetanguishene.  Families of [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] [[fur trader]]s who had moved with the British from Michilimackinac to Drummond Island after the [[War of 1812]], moved again to Penetanguishene.  They settled in the town and the surrounding area. Although the naval base was closed in 1834, the military base remained until 1856. Some of the troops settled in the area after their service was complete providing an English-speaking population.\n\nIn the 1840s, French-speaking families from [[Quebec]] (mainly from the area immediately east of Montreal), attracted by promises of cheap and fertile land, joined the French-speaking Drummond Island settlers already in the area.  Later, as the [[logging]] industry began to develop, more English-speaking settlers arrived.  Penetanguishene became the local market and meeting place for these individuals. Many of Penetanguishene's families today are descended from the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois settlers who arrived in the 1800s, giving the town a marked bilingual nature.\n\n==Economy==\nPenetanguishene has several light industrial businesses mainly dealing with plastic and aluminum containers, though CCL which makes aluminum containers announced the closing of its facilities in 2013. It is host to the [[Central North Correctional Centre]]. In addition there is the [[Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care]] which includes a high security forensic psychiatric unit for people declared to be not criminally responsible for dangerous offences but considered unsafe to be allowed in the community.<ref>[http://www.penetanguishene.ca/en/business/business-directory.asp Penetanguishene Town website - Business Directory]</ref>\n\nTourism occupies a considerable portion of the economy with five marinas and shops and restaurants catering to the tourist trade. In the winter, [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]] and [[ice fishing]] is popular and there is a mid-Winter carnival.\n\n==Tourism and sights==\n[[File:St James on-the-Lines.JPG|thumbnail|left|200px|Built in 1836, [[St. James on-the-Lines]] is an historic Anglican garrison church in Penetanguishene.]]\nThe historic naval and military base (now called Discovery Harbour) near Penetanguishene is open to visitors.  There are reconstructed buildings from the historic Penetanguishene Naval Yard and two replica sailing ships from the 1812 period, [[HMS Bee|HMS ''Bee'']] and HMS ''Tecumseth'' (c. 1994). The ships no longer sail with passengers but they may be visited in the harbour. The original HMS Tecumseth was raised in 1953 and preserved at a nearby display area.\n\nThe King's Wharf Theatre located at Discovery Harbour has a programme of popular plays and musicals every summer.\n\nThere are two notable and historic churches located in Penetanguishene. The oldest is [[St. James on-the-Lines]], a small wooden [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church built in 1836 to serve the military garrison and civilian population. The most prominent is the large limestone [[Roman Catholic]] church named St. Anne's.

Simcoe County Pioneer and Historical Society (Barrie, ON: 1912).</ref> meaning \"land of the white rolling sands\".\n\n==History==\nAs early as [[anno Domini|AD]] 800, the [[Wyandot people]] settled in semi-permanent villages in the area. The young [[French people|French]] [[Translation|translator]], [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]], was the first European to set foot in the Penetanguishene area, some time between 1610 and 1614.\n\nIn 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]], the first [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]], visited the area and saw the location's potential as a naval base.  He wanted to use the bay to shelter [[warships]] to protect British interests on lakes Huron, Erie and Michigan.  Beginning in 1814, the British-Canadians built the [[Penetanguishene Road]] to provide the area a land route to [[Barrie]] and [[Toronto]], as it was previously accessible only by water transport along the rivers or across Georgian Bay.\n\nIn 1817, naval units from [[Michilimackinac]] and Schooner Town (near modern-day [[Wasaga Beach]]) were consolidated at the [[Penetanguishene Naval Yard]].  But, because treaty limitations with the U.S. limited both countries' naval power on the [[Great Lakes]], two British armed topsail schooners, [[HMS Tecumseth|HMS ''Tecumseth'']] and [[HMS Newash|HMS ''Newash'']] were laid up \"in ordinary\", and eventually reported to have sunk at their moorings in the harbour in 1828.  Some other small craft were headquartered in Penetanguishene for the exploration and mapping of the Great Lakes' coastline.\n\nIn 1828, the main British military establishment on the Upper Lakes moved from Drummond Island to Penetanguishene.  Families of [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] [[fur trader]]s who had moved with the British from Michilimackinac to Drummond Island after the [[War of 1812]], moved again to Penetanguishene.  They settled in the town and the surrounding area. Although the naval base was closed in 1834, the military base remained until 1856. Some of the troops settled in the area after their service was complete providing an English-speaking population.\n\nIn the 1840s, French-speaking families from [[Quebec]] (mainly from the area immediately east of Montreal), attracted by promises of cheap and fertile land, joined the French-speaking Drummond Island settlers already in the area.  Later, as the [[logging]] industry began to develop, more English-speaking settlers arrived.  Penetanguishene became the local market and meeting place for these individuals. Many of Penetanguishene's families today are descended from the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois settlers who arrived in the 1800s, giving the town a marked bilingual nature.\n\n==Economy==\nPenetanguishene has several light industrial businesses mainly dealing with plastic and aluminum containers, though CCL which makes aluminum containers announced the closing of its facilities in 2013. It is host to the [[Central North Correctional Centre]]. In addition there is the [[Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care]] which includes a high security forensic psychiatric unit for people declared to be not criminally responsible for dangerous offences but considered unsafe to be allowed in the community.<ref>[http://www.penetanguishene.ca/en/business/business-directory.asp Penetanguishene Town website - Business Directory]</ref>\n\nTourism occupies a considerable portion of the economy with five marinas and shops and restaurants catering to the tourist trade. In the winter, [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]] and [[ice fishing]] is popular and there is a mid-Winter carnival.\n\n==Tourism and sights==\n[[File:St James on-the-Lines.JPG|thumbnail|left|200px|Built in 1836, [[St. James on-the-Lines]] is an historic Anglican garrison church in Penetanguishene.]]\nThe historic naval and military base (now called Discovery Harbour) near Penetanguishene is open to visitors.  There are reconstructed buildings from the historic Penetanguishene Naval Yard and two replica sailing ships from the 1812 period, [[HMS Bee|HMS ''Bee'']] and HMS ''Tecumseth'' (c. 1994). The ships no longer sail with passengers but they may be visited in the harbour. The original HMS Tecumseth was raised in 1953 and preserved at a nearby display area.\n\nThe King's Wharf Theatre located at Discovery Harbour has a programme of popular plays and musicals every summer.\n\nThere are two notable and historic churches located in Penetanguishene. The oldest is [[St. James on-the-Lines]], a small wooden [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church built in 1836 to serve the military garrison and civilian population. The most prominent is the large limestone [[Roman Catholic]] church named St. Anne's. Originally named \"Ste Anne's Jesuit Memorial Church: Canadian National Shrine\", it is sometimes referred to today as the \"Cathedral of the North\". The Church was constructed between 1886 and 1902 by pastor Theophile Francis Laboureau. Laboureau secured major funding for the church from the Bishops of Rouen and Normandy in France as well as the governments of England, France and the United States.<ref>St. Anne's of Penetanguishene: Huronia's First Mission by David Dupuis</ref> As it serves a bilingual Catholic community, services are held in both French and English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penetanguishene.ca/siteengine/ActivePage.asp?PageID=26|title=Penetanguishene - Attractions|publisher=Town of Penetanguishene|accessdate=2013-06-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628053139/http://www.penetanguishene.ca/siteengine/ActivePage.asp?PageID=26|archivedate=2013-06-28}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nPenetanguishene has five different school boards within its limits&nbsp;\u2014 the publicly funded English board ([[Simcoe County District School Board]]), which runs James Keating Elementary School; the French Catholic School Board [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]], which operates \u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Saint-Louis; the Public French School Board, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the English Catholic School Board.

and author.<ref name=\"ISFDB\">{{isfdb name|id=405|name=Don D'Ammassa}}</ref><ref name=\"Clute\">[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/dammassa_don Clute, John. \"Don D'Ammassaa.\"] Article in ''SFE: The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''.</ref> He is chiefly known for his numerous reviews, written over a period of more than thirty years.<ref name=\"Clute\"/> He writes as Don D'Ammassa.<ref name=\"ISFDB\"/><ref name=\"Clute\"/>\n\n==Writing career==\nD'Ammassa first made a name for himself as a fan writer in the 1970s; he was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer]] for 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1986, and his [[fanzine]] ''Mythologies'' was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]] for 1977 and 1985. His career as both critic and professional author began in the early 1980s. A long-time reviewer for ''[[Science Fiction Chronicle]]'', his reviews have also appeared in other venues, and many are compiled on his website ''Critical Mass''. According to [[John Clute]], his assessments are \"noted for ... fairness and generosity, and for the extremely wide range of texts he has covered.\" His broad knowledge of speculative and adventure fiction are reflected in his ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (2005), ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction'' (2006) and ''Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction'' (2009).<ref name=\"Clute\"/>\n\nAs a short story writer D'Ammassa has produced a substantial body of horror stories and relatively fewer science fiction and fantasy tales. His longer works are more evenly divided between these genres. His more recent novels \"convey a sense that he is systematically traversing the worlds of twentieth century sf in order to pay tribute from a more recent perspective to the worlds and modes typical of the form.\"<ref name=\"Clute\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Series===\n====Sandor Dyle====\n*''Scarab'' (2004)\n*''Narcissus'' (2007)\n\n====Wanda Coyne====\n*''The Maltese Gargoyle'' (2015)\n*''The Hippogriff of the Baskervilles'' (2016)\n*''Ten Little Homunculi'' (2017)\n\n===Other novels===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Blood Beast'' (1988; rewritten as ''The Gargoyle'' (2011))\n*''Servants of Chaos (2002)\n*''Haven'' (2004)\n*''Dead of Winter'' (2007)\n*''The Kaleidoscope'' (2015)\n*''The Sinking Island'' (2015)\n*''Caverns of Chaos'' (2015)\n*''Living Things'' (2015)\n*''Perilous Pursuits'' (2015)\n*''Wormdance'' (2015)\n*''Carbon Copies'' (2015) \n*''Multiplicity'' (2015)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Collections===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Translation Station'' (2011)\n*''That Way Madness Lies'' (2015)\n*''Little Evils'' (2015)\n*''Passing Death'' (2015)\n*''Elaborate Lies: Tales of Fantasy'' (2015)\n*''Date with the Dark'' (2015)\n*''Sandcastles'' (2015)\n*''The Devil Is in the Details'' (2015)\n*''Alien & Otherwise'' (2015)\n*''Shadows Over R'lyeh'' (2015)\n*''Phantom of the Space Opera'' (2015)\n*''More Shadows Over R'lyeh'' (2017) \n*''The Retro Collection'' (2017)\n*''Still More Shadows Over R'Lyeh'' (2019) \n{{div col end}}\n\n===Short stories===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*\"Automatic Success\" (1982)\n*\"Love Charm\" (1985)\n*\"The Hatchetman\" (1989)\n*\"Literally Speaking\" (1990)\n*\"Little Evils\" (1991)\n*\"Strange Developments\" (1991)\n*\"The Guard Tower\" (1991)\n*\"The Splicer\" (1991)\n*\"Wake Up Call\" (1991)\n*\"Shadow Over R'lyeh\" (1991)\n*\"Context\" (1992)\n*\"The Dead Beat Society\" (1992)\n*\"Homework\" (1992)\n*\"Cleansing Agent\" (1993)\n*\"Friday Nights at Home\" (1993)\n*\"Puppets\" (1993)\n*\"Subterrine -

After this marriage Laxmi gets pregnant and gives birth to a son, Rajkumar, and shortly thereafter Rukmani too gives birth to a son, Lakhan. Rajkumar is abducted, and disappears from their lives. Thereafter, Satyaprakash is arrested for the murder of a contractor, and sentenced to prison. Rukmani and her brother, Buddiram, take over running the household, and inflict abuse on Laxmi. Years later, a young man appears claiming to be the missing son of Laxmi and Satyaprakash, and he attempts to bring some sense and honor for poor Laxmi. But this does not last for long, when Satyaprakash is released from prison, he recognizes the young man, as his fellow prison inmate, and much to the shock and dismay of Laxmi, asks him to leave the house, little knowing that he has now thrown open the door for Buddhiram to kill him and Laxmi.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ashok Kumar]] as Kailashnath\n*[[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Thakur Satyaprakash\n*[[Nutan Behl]]\tas Laxmi Satyaprakash \n*[[Anil Kapoor]] as Ram Kumar / Raj Kumar\n*[[Madhuri Dixit]] as Janki (as Madhuri)\n*[[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] as Rukmani\n*[[Kader Khan]]\tas Buddhiram\n*[[Shakti Kapoor]] as Laakhan\n*[[Gulshan Grover]] as Gulloo\n*[[Sharat Saxena]] as Shambhu Dada (as Sharad Saxena)\n*[[Bharat Bhushan]] in a cameo appearance in the song \"Ram Ki Baatein..
