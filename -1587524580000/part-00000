In [[physics]], the center of mass is the arithmetic mean of all points [[Weighting|weighted]] by the local density or [[specific weight]]. If a physical object has uniform density, its center of mass is the same as the centroid of its shape.\n\nIn [[geography]], the centroid of a radial projection of a region of the Earth's surface to sea level is the region's [[geographical center]].\n\n== History ==\nThe term \"centroid\" is of recent coinage (1814).{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} It is used as a substitute for the older terms \"[[center of gravity]],\" and \"[[center of mass]]\", when the purely geometrical aspects of that point are to be emphasized. The term is peculiar to the English language.<!-- And Polish. --> The French use \"centre de gravit\u00e9\" on most occasions, and others use terms of similar meaning.\n\nThe center of gravity, as the name indicates, is a notion that arose in mechanics, most likely in connection with building activities. When, where, and by whom it was invented is not known, as it is a concept that likely occurred to many people individually with minor differences.\n\nWhile it is possible [[Euclid]] was still active in Alexandria during the childhood of [[Archimedes]] (287-212 BCE), it is certain that when Archimedes visited [[Alexandria]], Euclid was no longer there. Thus Archimedes could not have learned the theorem that the medians of a triangle meet in a point\u2014the center of gravity of the triangle directly from Euclid, as this proposition is not in [[Euclid's Elements]]. The first explicit statement of this proposition is due to [[Hero_of_Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] (perhaps the first century CE) and occurs in his Mechanics. It may be added, in passing, that the proposition did not become common in the textbooks on plane geometry until the nineteenth century.\n\nWhile Archimedes does not state that proposition explicitly, he makes indirect references to it, suggesting he was familiar with it. However, [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla|Jean Etienne Montucla]] (1725-1799), the author of the first history of mathematics (1758), declares categorically (vol. I, p.&nbsp;463) that the center of gravity of solids is a subject Archimedes did not touch.\n\nIn 1802 [[Charles Bossut]] (1730-1813) published a two-volume Essai sur l'histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des math\u00e9matiques. This book was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, judging from the fact that within two years after its publication it was already available in translation in Italian (1802\u201303), English (1803), and German (1804). Bossut credits Archimedes with having found the centroid of plane figures, but has nothing to say about solids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Court|first=Nathan Altshiller|date=1960|title=Notes on the centroid|journal=The Mathematics Teacher|volume=53|issue=1|pages=33\u201335|jstor=27956057}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nThe geometric centroid of a [[convex set|convex]] object always lies in the object.  A non-convex object might have a centroid that is outside the figure itself. The centroid of a [[Annulus (mathematics)|ring]] or a [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]], for example, lies in the object's central void.\n\nIf the centroid is defined, it is a [[fixed points of isometry groups in Euclidean space|fixed point of all isometries]] in its [[symmetry group]]. In particular, the geometric centroid of an object lies in the intersection of all its [[hyperplane]]s of [[symmetry]].  The centroid of many figures ([[regular polygon]], [[regular polyhedron]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[rectangle]], [[rhombus]], [[circle (geometry)|circle]], [[sphere (geometry)|sphere]], [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]], [[Lam\u00e9 curve|superellipse]], [[superellipsoid]], etc.) can be determined by this principle alone.\n\nIn particular, the centroid of a [[parallelogram]] is the meeting point of its two [[diagonal]]s.  This is not true for other [[quadrilateral]]s.\n\nFor the same reason, the centroid of an object with [[translational symmetry]] is undefined (or lies outside the enclosing space), because a translation has no fixed point.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe centroid of a triangle is the intersection of the three [[median (triangle)|medians]] of the triangle (each median connecting a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side).<ref name = altshiller66>{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|p=66}}</ref>\n\nFor other properties of a triangle's centroid, see [[#Of a triangle|below]].\n\n== Locating ==\n=== Plumb line method ===\nThe centroid of a uniformly dense [[planar lamina]], such as in figure (a) below, may be determined experimentally by using a [[plumbline]] and a pin to find the collocated center of mass of a thin body of uniform density having the same shape.  The body is held by the pin, inserted at a point, off the presumed centroid in such a way that it can freely rotate around the pin; the plumb line is then dropped from the pin (figure b).  The position of the plumbline is traced on the surface, and the procedure is repeated with the pin inserted at any different point (or a number of points) off the centroid of the object. The unique intersection point of these lines will be the centroid (figure c).  Provided that the body is of uniform density, all lines made this way will include the centroid, and all lines will cross at exactly the same place.\n\n{| cellpadding=3\n|- valign=center\n| [[File:Center gravity 0.svg|147px|center]]\n| [[File:Center gravity 1.svg|183px|center]]\n| [[File:Center gravity 2.svg|157px|center]]\n|-\n| align=center | (a)\n| align=center | (b)\n| align=center | (c)\n|}\n\nThis method can be extended (in theory) to concave shapes where the centroid may lie outside the shape, and virtually to solids (again, of uniform density), where the centroid may lie within the body. The (virtual) positions of the plumb lines need to be recorded by means other than by drawing them along the shape.\n\n=== Balancing method ===\nFor convex two-dimensional shapes, the centroid can be found by balancing the shape on a smaller shape, such as the top of a narrow cylinder.  The centroid occurs somewhere within the range of contact between the two shapes (and exactly at the point where the shape would balance on a pin).  In principle, progressively narrower cylinders can be used to find the centroid to arbitrary precision.  In practice air currents make this infeasible.  However, by marking the overlap range from multiple balances, one can achieve a considerable level of accuracy.\n\n=== Of a finite set of points ===\nThe centroid of a finite set of <math>{k}</math> points <math>\\mathbf{x}_1,\\mathbf{x}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_k</math> in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is\n:<math>\\mathbf{C} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_1+\\mathbf{x}_2+\\cdots+\\mathbf{x}_k}{k} </math>.<ref name = protter520/>\nThis point minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances between itself and each point in the set.\n\n=== By geometric decomposition ===\nThe centroid of a plane figure <math>X</math> can be computed by dividing it into a finite number of simpler figures <math>X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n</math>, computing the centroid <math>C_i</math> and area <math>A_i</math> of each part, and then computing\n\n: <math> C_x = \\frac{\\sum C_{i_x} A_i}{\\sum A_i} , C_y = \\frac{\\sum C_{i_y} A_i}{\\sum A_i}</math>\n\nHoles in the figure <math>X</math>, overlaps between the parts, or parts that extend outside the figure can all be handled using negative areas <math>A_i</math>. Namely, the measures <math>A_i</math> should be taken with positive and negative signs in such a way that the sum of the signs of <math>A_i</math> for all parts that enclose a given point <math>p</math> is 1 if <math>p</math> belongs to <math>X</math>, and 0 otherwise.\n\nFor example, the figure below (a) is easily divided into a square and a triangle, both with positive area; and a circular hole, with negative area (b).\n{{multiple images\n|align=center\n|height=200\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=COG 1.svg\n|caption1=(a) 2D Object\n|image2=COG 2.svg\n|caption2=(b) Object described using simpler elements\n|image3=COG 3.svg\n|caption3=(c) Centroids of elements of the object\n}}\nThe centroid of each part can be found in any [[list of centroids|list of centroids of simple shapes]] (c). Then the centroid of the figure is the weighted average of the three points.  The horizontal position of the centroid, from the left edge of the figure is\n:<math>x = \\frac{5 \\times 10^2 + 13.33 \\times \\frac{1}{2}10^2 - 3 \\times \\pi2.5^2}{10^2 + \\frac{1}{2}10^2 -\\pi2.5^2} \\approx 8.5 \\mbox{ units}.</math>\nThe vertical position of the centroid is found in the same way.\n\nThe same formula holds for any three-dimensional objects, except that each <math>A_i</math> should be the volume of <math>X_i</math>, rather than its area.  It also holds for any subset of <math>\\R^d</math>, for any dimension <math>d</math>, with the areas replaced by the <math>d</math>-dimensional [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s of the parts.\n\n=== By integral formula ===\nThe centroid of a subset ''X'' of  <math>\\R^n</math> can also be computed by the [[integral]]\n\n:<math>C = \\frac{\\int x g(x) \\; dx}{\\int g(x) \\; dx}</math>\n\nwhere the integrals are taken over the whole space <math>\\R^n</math>, and ''g'' is the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset, which is 1 inside  ''X'' and 0 outside it.<ref name = protter526>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=526}}</ref>  Note that the denominator is simply the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of the set ''X''. This formula cannot be applied if the set ''X'' has zero measure, or if either integral diverges.\n\nAnother formula for the centroid is\n\n:<math>C_k = \\frac{\\int z S_k(z) \\; dz}{\\int S_k(z) \\; dz}</math>\n\nwhere ''C''<sub>''k''</sub>  is the ''k''th coordinate of ''C'', and ''S''<sub>''k''</sub>(''z'') is the measure of the intersection of ''X'' with the hyperplane defined by the equation ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''z''.  Again, the denominator is simply the measure of ''X''.\n\nFor a plane figure, in particular, the barycenter coordinates are\n\n:<math>C_{\\mathrm x} = \\frac{\\int x S_{\\mathrm y}(x) \\; dx}{A}</math>\n\n:<math>C_{\\mathrm y} = \\frac{\\int y S_{\\mathrm x}(y) \\; dy}{A}</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is the area of the figure ''X''; ''S''<sub>y</sub>(''x'') is the length of the intersection of ''X'' with the vertical line at [[abscissa]] ''x''; and ''S''<sub>x</sub>(''y'') is the analogous quantity for the swapped axes.\n\n=== Of a bounded region ===\nThe centroid <math>(\\bar{x},\\;\\bar{y})</math> of a region bounded by the graphs of the [[continuous function]]s <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> such that <math>f(x) \\geq g(x)</math> on the interval <math>[a, b]</math>, <math>a \\leq x \\leq b</math>, is given by\n\n:<math>\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{A}\\int_a^b x[f(x) - g(x)]\\;dx</math><ref name=\"protter526\" />\n\n:<math>\\bar{y}=\\frac{1}{A}\\int_a^b \\left[\\frac{f(x) + g(x)}{2}\\right][f(x) - g(x)]\\;dx,</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=527}}</ref>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the area of the region (given by <math>\\int_a^b [f(x) - g(x)]\\;dx</math>).<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=528}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Larson|1998|pp=458\u2013460}}</ref>\n\n=== Of an L-shaped object ===\nThis is a method of determining the centroid of an L-shaped object.\n\n[[Image:CoG of L shape.svg|300px]]\n\n#Divide the shape into two rectangles, as shown in fig 2.

The term is peculiar to the English language.<!-- And Polish. --> The French use \"centre de gravit\u00e9\" on most occasions, and others use terms of similar meaning.\n\nThe center of gravity, as the name indicates, is a notion that arose in mechanics, most likely in connection with building activities. When, where, and by whom it was invented is not known, as it is a concept that likely occurred to many people individually with minor differences.\n\nWhile it is possible [[Euclid]] was still active in Alexandria during the childhood of [[Archimedes]] (287-212 BCE), it is certain that when Archimedes visited [[Alexandria]], Euclid was no longer there. Thus Archimedes could not have learned the theorem that the medians of a triangle meet in a point\u2014the center of gravity of the triangle directly from Euclid, as this proposition is not in [[Euclid's Elements]]. The first explicit statement of this proposition is due to [[Hero_of_Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] (perhaps the first century CE) and occurs in his Mechanics. It may be added, in passing, that the proposition did not become common in the textbooks on plane geometry until the nineteenth century.\n\nWhile Archimedes does not state that proposition explicitly, he makes indirect references to it, suggesting he was familiar with it. However, [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla|Jean Etienne Montucla]] (1725-1799), the author of the first history of mathematics (1758), declares categorically (vol. I, p.&nbsp;463) that the center of gravity of solids is a subject Archimedes did not touch.\n\nIn 1802 [[Charles Bossut]] (1730-1813) published a two-volume Essai aur PhisMire generale des mathematiques. This book was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, judging from the fact that within two years after its publication it was already available in translation in Italian (1802\u201303), English (1803), and German (1804). Bossut credits Archimedes with having found the centroid of plane figures, but has nothing to say about solids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Court|first=Nathan Altshiller|date=1960|title=Notes on the centroid|journal=The Mathematics Teacher|volume=53|issue=1|pages=33\u201335|jstor=27956057}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nThe geometric centroid of a [[convex set|convex]] object always lies in the object.  A non-convex object might have a centroid that is outside the figure itself. The centroid of a [[Annulus (mathematics)|ring]] or a [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]], for example, lies in the object's central void.\n\nIf the centroid is defined, it is a [[fixed points of isometry groups in Euclidean space|fixed point of all isometries]] in its [[symmetry group]]. In particular, the geometric centroid of an object lies in the intersection of all its [[hyperplane]]s of [[symmetry]].  The centroid of many figures ([[regular polygon]], [[regular polyhedron]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[rectangle]], [[rhombus]], [[circle (geometry)|circle]], [[sphere (geometry)|sphere]], [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]], [[Lam\u00e9 curve|superellipse]], [[superellipsoid]], etc.) can be determined by this principle alone.\n\nIn particular, the centroid of a [[parallelogram]] is the meeting point of its two [[diagonal]]s.  This is not true for other [[quadrilateral]]s.\n\nFor the same reason, the centroid of an object with [[translational symmetry]] is undefined (or lies outside the enclosing space), because a translation has no fixed point.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe centroid of a triangle is the intersection of the three [[median (triangle)|medians]] of the triangle (each median connecting a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side).<ref name = altshiller66>{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|p=66}}</ref>\n\nFor other properties of a triangle's centroid, see [[#Of a triangle|below]].\n\n== Locating ==\n=== Plumb line method ===\nThe centroid of a uniformly dense [[planar lamina]], such as in figure (a) below, may be determined experimentally by using a [[plumbline]] and a pin to find the collocated center of mass of a thin body of uniform density having the same shape.  The body is held by the pin, inserted at a point, off the presumed centroid in such a way that it can freely rotate around the pin; the plumb line is then dropped from the pin (figure b).  The position of the plumbline is traced on the surface, and the procedure is repeated with the pin inserted at any different point (or a number of points) off the centroid of the object. The unique intersection point of these lines will be the centroid (figure c).  Provided that the body is of uniform density, all lines made this way will include the centroid, and all lines will cross at exactly the same place.\n\n{| cellpadding=3\n|- valign=center\n| [[File:Center gravity 0.svg|147px|center]]\n| [[File:Center gravity 1.svg|183px|center]]\n| [[File:Center gravity 2.svg|157px|center]]\n|-\n| align=center | (a)\n| align=center | (b)\n| align=center | (c)\n|}\n\nThis method can be extended (in theory) to concave shapes where the centroid may lie outside the shape, and virtually to solids (again, of uniform density), where the centroid may lie within the body. The (virtual) positions of the plumb lines need to be recorded by means other than by drawing them along the shape.\n\n=== Balancing method ===\nFor convex two-dimensional shapes, the centroid can be found by balancing the shape on a smaller shape, such as the top of a narrow cylinder.  The centroid occurs somewhere within the range of contact between the two shapes (and exactly at the point where the shape would balance on a pin).  In principle, progressively narrower cylinders can be used to find the centroid to arbitrary precision.  In practice air currents make this infeasible.  However, by marking the overlap range from multiple balances, one can achieve a considerable level of accuracy.\n\n=== Of a finite set of points ===\nThe centroid of a finite set of <math>{k}</math> points <math>\\mathbf{x}_1,\\mathbf{x}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_k</math> in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is\n:<math>\\mathbf{C} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_1+\\mathbf{x}_2+\\cdots+\\mathbf{x}_k}{k} </math>.<ref name = protter520/>\nThis point minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances between itself and each point in the set.\n\n=== By geometric decomposition ===\nThe centroid of a plane figure <math>X</math> can be computed by dividing it into a finite number of simpler figures <math>X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n</math>, computing the centroid <math>C_i</math> and area <math>A_i</math> of each part, and then computing\n\n: <math> C_x = \\frac{\\sum C_{i_x} A_i}{\\sum A_i} , C_y = \\frac{\\sum C_{i_y} A_i}{\\sum A_i}</math>\n\nHoles in the figure <math>X</math>, overlaps between the parts, or parts that extend outside the figure can all be handled using negative areas <math>A_i</math>. Namely, the measures <math>A_i</math> should be taken with positive and negative signs in such a way that the sum of the signs of <math>A_i</math> for all parts that enclose a given point <math>p</math> is 1 if <math>p</math> belongs to <math>X</math>, and 0 otherwise.\n\nFor example, the figure below (a) is easily divided into a square and a triangle, both with positive area; and a circular hole, with negative area (b).\n{{multiple images\n|align=center\n|height=200\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=COG 1.svg\n|caption1=(a) 2D Object\n|image2=COG 2.svg\n|caption2=(b) Object described using simpler elements\n|image3=COG 3.svg\n|caption3=(c) Centroids of elements of the object\n}}\nThe centroid of each part can be found in any [[list of centroids|list of centroids of simple shapes]] (c). Then the centroid of the figure is the weighted average of the three points.  The horizontal position of the centroid, from the left edge of the figure is\n:<math>x = \\frac{5 \\times 10^2 + 13.33 \\times \\frac{1}{2}10^2 - 3 \\times \\pi2.5^2}{10^2 + \\frac{1}{2}10^2 -\\pi2.5^2} \\approx 8.5 \\mbox{ units}.</math>\nThe vertical position of the centroid is found in the same way.\n\nThe same formula holds for any three-dimensional objects, except that each <math>A_i</math> should be the volume of <math>X_i</math>, rather than its area.  It also holds for any subset of <math>\\R^d</math>, for any dimension <math>d</math>, with the areas replaced by the <math>d</math>-dimensional [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s of the parts.\n\n=== By integral formula ===\nThe centroid of a subset ''X'' of  <math>\\R^n</math> can also be computed by the [[integral]]\n\n:<math>C = \\frac{\\int x g(x) \\; dx}{\\int g(x) \\; dx}</math>\n\nwhere the integrals are taken over the whole space <math>\\R^n</math>, and ''g'' is the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset, which is 1 inside  ''X'' and 0 outside it.<ref name = protter526>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=526}}</ref>  Note that the denominator is simply the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of the set ''X''. This formula cannot be applied if the set ''X'' has zero measure, or if either integral diverges.\n\nAnother formula for the centroid is\n\n:<math>C_k = \\frac{\\int z S_k(z) \\; dz}{\\int S_k(z) \\; dz}</math>\n\nwhere ''C''<sub>''k''</sub>  is the ''k''th coordinate of ''C'', and ''S''<sub>''k''</sub>(''z'') is the measure of the intersection of ''X'' with the hyperplane defined by the equation ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''z''.

He was first introduced to music when, as a young child, he would listen to [[Country music|country and western]] music on a Zenith console radio and his father would play the guitar. He watched the Lawrence Welk show on TV at his grandparents' home where he saw [[Neil Levang|Neil LeVang]] and [[Buddy Merrill]]. His grandparents had a [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]; his father would pump the organ while Steve sat on his lap and worked out melodies on the keyboard. When he was eight years old, he began taking guitar lessons on a [[Lap steel guitar]]. He saw and heard [[Jerry Byrd]] play lap steel and learned what could be done on the instrument. He eventually switched to standard guitar and was influenced by the music of [[Chet Atkins]], [[The Ventures]] and [[Duane Eddy]].<ref name=herald>{{cite web|url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/steve-hunter-a-guitar-icon-with-some-serious-friends/216142|title=Steve Hunter a Guitar Icon with Some Serious Friends|publisher=Herald de Paris|date=August 27, 2013|last=Hernandez|first=Al Carlos|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHunter continued playing guitar throughout high school where he played in a group called the Weejuns, taking their name from G.H. Bass & Co.'s perennially-popular penny loafers. He subsequently joined the Light Brigade, a rock and soul group that played in the Decatur area.\n\nIn 1967, during the Vietnam War, Hunter was drafted into the Army, trained as an x-ray technician, and served in an air evacuation hospital in Okinawa, Japan where Vietnam combat casualties were being treated. He considered becoming a doctor but he enjoyed music so much he knew he would follow a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.glidemagazine.com/37642/steve-hunter/||title=Steve Hunter|publisher=Glide Magazine|date=June 15, 2013|last=Derrough|first=Leslie Michele|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion of his stint in the Army, he returned to Decatur where he built a reputation as an outstanding guitar player. \nOne day he got a telephone call from his Decatur friend, [[John Sauter|John \"Polar Bear\" Sauter]], that changed his life.\n\n==Career==\nHunter has had an illustrious 40-year career as a session musician, band member and as a solo performer.\n\n===Work with Mitch Ryder===\nJohn Sauter called Hunter to tell him that he was playing with [[Mitch Ryder]] in Detroit and that Ryder was auditioning for guitar players.  He suggested that Hunter come to Detroit and try out. Hunter packed up his guitar and made the eight-hour drive to Detroit.\nHunter made the cut and became part of Mitch Ryder's new band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. There Hunter met and formed a long-time professional association with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].\nDetroit released one self-titled album on [[Paramount Records]]. They had a hit with a cover of Lou Reed's \"Rock & Roll\". Reed was so impressed with Hunter's arrangement and performance on that song that he recruited Hunter to join his band.<ref name=daily/>\n\n===Work with Alice Cooper===\n[[File:Steve_Hunter_%C3%A0_Rennes_en_2011,_avec_Alice_Cooper..jpg|thumb|right|120px|     2011<br> Steve Hunter<br> with [[Alice Cooper]]<br> in Rennes, France]]\nIn the 1970s, he appeared on five [[Alice Cooper]] albums, all of which were produced by Ezrin. His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]''. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' alongside guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] as seen in the film ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]''. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show.

I had a long wait between dubs and was waiting in the lobby. Jack Douglas popped his head out of Studio C and asked 'Hey, do you feel like playing?' I said sure, so I grabbed my guitar and went in. I had two run thru's, then Jack said 'great, that's it!' That turned out to be the opening solos on 'Train Kept A Rollin\u2019'.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.detroitrocknrollmagazine.com/2015/02/aerosmiths-train-kept-rollin-who-did.html|title=Who Really Played the Guitar Solos on Aerosmith's \"Train Kept A Rollin?\"|publisher=Detroit Rock N Roll Magazine|date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>\n\n===Work with Jack Bruce, Peter Gabriel and other artists===\nIn 1974, shortly after his work with the band on the live Reed albums, Hunter played guitar on former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]]'s solo album ''[[Out of the Storm (Jack Bruce album)|Out of the Storm]]''.\n\nHe played on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s self-titled [[Peter Gabriel (1977 album)|first solo album (1977)]] that included the classic single \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\" which was likewise produced by Ezrin.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vintageguitar.com/3752/steve-hunter/|title=Steve Hunter - The deacon Sets It Straight|publisher=Vintage Guitar Magazine|date= |last=Allen|first=Rick|accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref> He also played on tour with Gabriel for the North American leg and a few shows in the UK during March / April 1977, sharing guitar duties with Robert Fripp. \n \nOther artists Hunter has worked with include [[David Lee Roth]] (in the mid-1990s), [[Julian Lennon]], [[Dr. John]], [[Tracy Chapman]] and more recently [[Glen Campbell]] and 2Cellos.

He was first introduced to music when, as a young child, he would listen to [[Country music|country and western]] music on a Zenith console radio and his father would play the guitar. He watched the Lawrence Welk show on TV at his grandparents' home where he saw [[Neil Levang|Neil LeVang]] and [[Buddy Merrill]]. His grandparents had a [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]; his father would pump the organ while Steve sat on his lap and worked out melodies on the keyboard. When he was eight years old, he began taking guitar lessons on a [[Lap steel guitar]]. He saw and heard [[Jerry Byrd]] play lap steel and learned what could be done on the instrument. He eventually switched to standard guitar and was influenced by the music of [[Chet Atkins]], [[The Ventures]] and [[Duane Eddy]].<ref name=herald>{{cite web|url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/steve-hunter-a-guitar-icon-with-some-serious-friends/216142|title=Steve Hunter a Guitar Icon with Some Serious Friends|publisher=Herald de Paris|date=August 27, 2013|last=Hernandez|first=Al Carlos|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHunter continued playing guitar throughout high school where he played in a group called the Weejuns, taking their name from G.H. Bass & Co.'s perennially-popular penny loafers. He subsequently joined the Light Brigade, a rock and soul group that played in the Decatur area.\n\nIn 1967, during the Vietnam War, Hunter was drafted into the Army, trained as an x-ray technician, and served in an air evacuation hospital in Okinawa, Japan where Vietnam combat casualties were being treated. He considered becoming a doctor but he enjoyed music so much he knew he would follow a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.glidemagazine.com/37642/steve-hunter/||title=Steve Hunter|publisher=Glide Magazine|date=June 15, 2013|last=Derrough|first=Leslie Michele|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion of his stint in the Army, he returned to Decatur where he built a reputation as an outstanding guitar player. \nOne day he got a telephone call from his Decatur friend, [[John Sauter|John \"Polar Bear\" Sauter]], that changed his life.\n\n==Career==\nHunter has had an illustrious 40-year career as a session musician, band member and as a solo performer.\n\n===Work with Mitch Ryder===\nJohn Sauter called Hunter to tell him that he was playing with [[Mitch Ryder]] in Detroit and that Ryder was auditioning for guitar players.  He suggested that Hunter come to Detroit and try out. Hunter packed up his guitar and made the eight-hour drive to Detroit.\nHunter made the cut and became part of Mitch Ryder's new band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. There Hunter met and formed a long-time professional association with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].\nDetroit released one self-titled album on [[Paramount Records]]. They had a hit with a cover of Lou Reed's \"Rock & Roll\". Reed was so impressed with Hunter's arrangement and performance on that song that he recruited Hunter to join his band.<ref name=daily/>\n\n===Work with Alice Cooper===\n[[File:Steve_Hunter_%C3%A0_Rennes_en_2011,_avec_Alice_Cooper..jpg|thumb|right|120px|     2011<br> Steve Hunter<br> with [[Alice Cooper]]<br> in Rennes, France]]\nIn the 1970s, he appeared on five [[Alice Cooper]] albums, all of which were produced by Ezrin. His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]''. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' alongside guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] as seen in the film ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]''. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show.

I had a long wait between dubs and was waiting in the lobby. Jack Douglas popped his head out of Studio C and asked 'Hey, do you feel like playing?' I said sure, so I grabbed my guitar and went in. I had two run thru's, then Jack said 'great, that's it!'

Austin]]). The three Russo siblings are wizards in training and live with their [[Italian-American]] father Jerry ([[David DeLuise]]), a former wizard, and their [[Mexican-American]] mother, Theresa ([[Maria Canals Barrera]]) who is a mortal. Alex's best friend Harper ([[Jennifer Stone]]) also found out about the Russos' wizard powers in season 2. The siblings have to keep their secret safe while living in the mortal world. When they become adults, the three siblings will have a wizard competition to decide who will become the family wizard of their generation and keep his or her wizard powers. Harper used to have a crush on Justin, but now is in love with Justin's best friend, Zeke, who finds out about the Russo's wizard powers in season 4. Alex Russo ([[Selena Gomez]]) and Justin Russo ([[David Henrie]]) are the only characters to appear in every episode of the series.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Alex Russo===\n{{main|Alex Russo}}\n'''Alexandra Margarita Russo''' ([[Selena Gomez]]) is the only female out of the three Russo siblings, and the middle child. She is sly, rebellious, outgoing, and usually underachieves when it comes to school. She often gets into trouble because of her constant schemes (usually involving magic). She is part [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] and part [[Italians|Italian]]. Even though she is infamously known for doing the worst in wizard studies and school, and relentlessly torments her older brother Justin, Alex becomes much more mature throughout the series. Although she's somewhat lazy, Alex is smart, loyal, and caring. She goes through a long-term relationship with Mason Greyback, a purebred werewolf. She becomes the Russo family wizard at the end of the series. Usually, her mom calls her \"m'ija\", which is Spanish for \"my daughter\".\n\n===Justin Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = '''Justin Russo'''\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| first              = \"[[Wizards_of_Waverly_Place_(season_1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"<br>1x01, October 12, 2007\n| last               = \"Who Will Be The Family Wizard\"<br />4x28, January 6, 2012\n| creator            = Todd J.

He is very smart, and is often considered a nerd. He is in numerous clubs and has learned over 5000 spells. He continues his wizard studies in a Monster Hunting course. For his knowledge in wizardry, he takes after his father Jerry, who originally won the Wizard Family Competition against Kelbo and Megan. Unlike Alex, he is an overachiever when it comes to school. He is fairly athletic, and very respectful to his parents and other adults. Justin is responsible, sensible, kindhearted and hardworking, but can be a little sarcastic to Alex and Max. He revealed to Alex that he is jealous of her because he felt she is blessed with magic skills that he can't live up to, and it's reinforced when he refers to Alex as \"daddy's little princess\" (a unique, and often favoring, bond between a father and daughter). This is what drives him to be a better wizard. Alex consoles him by stating that he is her rock and foundation, and that she is actually jealous of his academic achievements, even though she openly admits to not caring about school. He has a long-term relationship with Juliet Van Heusen, a teenage vampire whose family runs the \"Late Night Bite\" (local competition for the [[Waverly Sub Station]]), which prompted a feud between the Russos and the Van Heusens. At first, their love is a forbidden romance, which Alex points out by referencing [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet]], but then they eventually start dating openly. Justin reveals to Alex that Juliet is his true love, after he felt heartbroken about being unable to see her due to the feuding families. Justin gets heartbroken again when Juliet was forced to break up with him due to her getting scratched by Mason the werewolf, as she stated that when that happens a vampire's appearance will revert to their true age.\n\nLater in the series, Alex tells the world that they are wizards and her and Justin's levels move down, so he makes a class with students who got kicked out of WizTech and later falls in love with an angel named Rosie.\n\nAt first, it seems that Justin won the Wizard Competition after being the first to cross the finish line, and he was about to be granted his full powers, when he says that he can't accept it because he didn't really win; Alex would have won if she hadn't come to back to help him, and he says that she deserves to be the Russo family wizard. Because of his honesty, Professor Crumbs allows both Justin and Alex to keep their powers and for Justin to take over as Headmaster of Wiz Tech.\n\nLater in the series he reconciles with Juliet after she regains her youthful appearance.\n\n===Max Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Max Russo\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| caption            = Austin attending the premiere of ''[[The Perfect Game]]'' on April 16, 2010\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

Austin]]) is the youngest of the three Russo siblings. Alex and Justin's magic are more advanced than Max's (as shown by the wands). Although he is an underachiever in the beginning, he advances more during the series. At first, he does not seem to be very bright, but this is later revealed to be due to a lack of focus and a short attention span, as he becomes an A+ model student when their school introduces uniforms, claiming it helps him focus. Alex and Justin are embarrassed and annoyed by his lack of intelligence, but they do occasionally take advantage of it, for example: When they tried to lure in a Genie back to her lamp, Alex suggested that after the Genie outsmarted them, they might be able to out-dumb her, and immediately asked Max what he'd do to get her back to grant him a wish. The Genie eventually allows him a wish, to which he responded with describing his appearance, which prompted the Genie to unintentionally reveal that there is a reset-button. He once revealed to Juliet, that he uses \"randomness\" to allow others to inadvertently reveal their true thoughts and feelings to him, though he later admitted that he still has no idea what is going on around him. He is very fond of skateboards. In the episode \"Three Maxes and a Little Lady\", Justin and Alex fall behind in the Wizard Competition, and Max gets a wish, which he uses to wish for the Wizard Competition to begin that day. However, both Alex and Justin use magic to turn into Max and reverse The Wish, to no avail. Max eventually decides to bump back the Wizard Competition; however, Alex and Justin cross spells and turn Max into Maxine, a girl version of him. In \"Who Will be the Family Wizard\", Max's powers are taken away, but Jerry and Teresa decide to give him The Sub Station, much to his happiness. Personality wise, Max takes after his Uncle Kelbo.\n\nMax is played by [[Jake T. Austin]] (also [[Bailee Madison]] as Maxine in season four).\n\n===Harper Finkle===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Harper Finkle\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| caption            = Stone attending \"The 6th Annual Hollywood Style Awards\" Beverly Hills, CA, Oct. 10, 2009\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\" <small>\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

Harper is a typical teenager, being self-expressive, but a little insecure at times. Unlike Alex, she is a hard-working student and a fairly positive person, but still connects well with Alex. Jennifer Stone does not appear as Harper in \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\" (which was actually the first episode produced, but the sixth episode broadcast\u2014the episode was aired out of production order).\n\nHarper is known for her outrageous fashion ensembles that she designs herself, most of which are \"food-themed\", such as one outfit seen in the season one episode \"Credit Check\" which resembled a cupcake. No one ever tells her that her fashion designs are (for the most part) ridiculous, but it is implied that everyone else thinks it. Not only does she create her own clothes, but she also makes her own jewelry as seen in the episode \"Art Museum Piece\", when she starts a booth selling her necklaces made of macaroni, glitter, and knobs from Alex's room. Despite her unseemly fashion choices, she believes it is better to stand out as an individual, and is confident that she will excel at whatever she tries, no matter what people think, and has a habit of laughing out loud when the atmosphere gets tense.\n\nShe was oblivious of the fact that Alex, Max and Justin are wizards until the episode \"Harper Knows\" when Alex finally told her because she felt guilty for not telling the truth to her best friend. This was also the first time Harper experienced the use of magic when Alex gave her a charmed costume with super powers. She is often paranoid of Alex's schemes, especially after she finds out about magic, but reluctantly gets involved anyway. Despite Alex's controlling and manipulative behavior, Harper always sees the good side in Alex and is willing to be accepting of her due to their friendship, to the point where she was the only person who believed that Alex wouldn't participate in a plot that, if successful, would prevent young wizards losing their powers in the Competition. She has known Alex since kindergarten and is always there when Alex needs support. In season three it is revealed that Harper is a [[cheerleader]], which is the only secret Harper has ever kept from Alex, largely due to Alex's typical disdain and mocking attitude towards cheerleaders.\n\nHarper's parents are featured in \"Wizards vs Finkles\" as traveling showpeople from Romania. They ask Harper to rejoin them for shows but Harper refuses, happy with her life with the Russos while Alex, fascinated with their lifestyle, accept in Harper's place. In the end the commitment and hard work drives Alex away, with Harper's parents leaving for Youngstown, Ohio, for a new gig on good terms with Harper and the rest of the Russos. In \"Meet the Werewolves\" it is revealed that Harper was born in Nebraska, backstage in a night club, most likely at one of her parent's shows. In \"Wizards vs. Vampires: Tasty Bites\", when Alex is so fed up with her family's new healthy living, she says, ''\"I'm so desperate, I'm thinking about going to Harper's house\"'', meaning that Harper's house is wild. In \"Alex Does Good\", Harper blurts out, ''\"It's about time I got some appreciation, Mom!\"'', claiming that her mom doesn't appreciate her. Harper moves in with Alex and the Russos in season three, most likely because of her home. (Although it was also motivated by her father's recent transfer to Pittsburgh and her unwillingness to leave Alex).\n\nIn the episode \"Future Harper\", it's revealed that Harper becomes a famous author, who writes books based on the Russos' wizard adventures, and writes under the name \"H.J. Darling\" (parody of [[J. K. Rowling]]). Alex, Justin, and Max find this out when they go to confront the author of the books (seven books in the series ''Charmed and Dangerous'') that mysteriously mimic their lives. As the older Harper ([[Rachel Dratch]]) tells them, she writes her books in the present day because in the future, wizards and magic in general have been outed, and books about magic are no longer so interesting. She doesn't tell the Russo kids who it was that revealed the existence of wizards, other than it happens to be one of the three; the Alex and Justin suspect it to be Max, to which he is first appalled but then agrees (though in a later episode the Russos are questioned by the government and they trick Justin into revealing that wizards exist, though this turned out to be a false exposure); and that she came back in time with the aid of one of the most powerful wizards of all time. It is unknown if she ever marries someone with the last name Darling, or if she just uses the name H.J. Darling as a way to keep her identity safe in the present day.\n\nIn the episode \"Third Wheel\", after it is discovered Stevie is a wizard, Alex starts hanging out with her more, neglecting Harper. Later in the episode, Harper confronts Alex on how she has been feeling left out. This leads to a heated argument, where Harper reveals her insecurities about how Alex is always taking her for granted and yet she never holds it against her. During this argument, they end up destroying the Homecoming float, which Justin tricked Harper into helping him build by disguising himself as Alex. Mr. Laritate witnesses this and threatens to have Alex expelled. For the sake of their friendship, Harper takes all the blame. Mr. Laritate believes her, considering that Alex never tells the truth, and punishes Harper with one week of detention. Later, Alex somehow sneaks into the detention room and apologizes for what happened. Forgiving her, Harper explains that she only did it because even if Stevie is Alex's new best friend, it's not going to keep her from being a friend to Alex. Alex compassionately says that her relationship with Harper is much stronger than it is with Stevie, by saying that Stevie is her ''friend'', but Harper is her ''sister''. When Stevie later appears to recruit Alex to aid her in a plot to destroy the power transference technology and thus prevent any younger wizards from losing their powers in the competition, Harper continues to believe that Alex will come through and do the right thing even when Justin is convinced that Alex has gone evil. Alex warmly thanks Harper for her faith in her after her true agenda is revealed when she freezes Stevie and allows Stevie's brother Warren to inherit his full powers.\n\nAt times, Jerry and Theresa like to take credit for Harper being their daughter, as in the episode \"Marathoner Helper\". Justin then says, \"C'mon, she's not your daughter.\" And as Alex walks in eating a hot dog with cereal he says, \"That's your daughter.\"\n\nShe usually shouts \"See ya in PE\" and screams when she is scared or nervous. In \"Helping Hand\", she screams while laughing stating she is scared and happy.\n\n===Theresa Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Theresa Russo\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"\n</small>\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J. Greenwald\n| portrayer          = [[Maria Canals Barrera]]\n| occupation         = Co-owner of Waverly Sub Station,<br />waitress\n| spouse             = [[List of Wizards of Waverly Place characters#Jerry Russo|Jerry Russo]]\n| gender             = Female\n| children           = [[Justin Russo (Wizards of Waverly Place)|Justin Russo]] (oldest son),<br />[[Alex Russo]] (daughter/middle child)</small><br />[[Max Russo]] <small>(youngest son)</small>\n}}\n'''Theresa Magdalena Margarita Russo'''<ref name=\"pilot\"/> (n\u00e9e '''Larkin'''), played by [[Maria Canals Barrera]], is the mother of Alex, Justin and Max Russo and co-owner of the Waverly Sub Station, with her husband Jerry; and is also the slightly more serious one of the couple. Theresa is [[Mexican American]] (as a [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]], Canals Barrera has [[Spanish (people)|Spanish]] ancestry through her Cuban parents).<ref name=\"youcantalways\">''Wizards of Waverly Place'' episode: \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\"</ref>\n\nTheresa Russo is a typical mother. She's fussy, caring and can be pretty embarrassing. Unlike her children, she is a mortal. She dislikes magic, probably because she was once possessed by a wizard's love spell for twelve years. Theresa lives on Waverly Place in Manhattan with her husband (and former wizard) [[Jerry Russo]] ([[David DeLuise]]) and her children: middle daughter [[Alex Russo]] ([[Selena Gomez]]), eldest son [[Justin Russo (Wizards of Waverly Place)|Justin Russo]] ([[David Henrie]]), and youngest child [[Max Russo]] ([[Jake T. Austin]]). She owns a sandwich shop called the [[Waverly Sub Station]] with her husband in which her children work. She is overprotective of Justin and Max, but Max especially. She tries to relate with her kids but it doesn't always work.\n\nTheresa stated that she is a \"''Proud Latina''\" and tries to get her children to learn about her and their [[Mexico|Mexican]] heritage. In season one's \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\", Theresa states that she once played guitar in an all-girl mariachi band \u2014 though when Justin says \"I didn't know you played the guitar\", Jerry says \"she doesn't\" \u2013 implying that Theresa is not a very good guitar player. This is shown in season 3.\n\nAt times, Theresa can be controlling of her kids and their lives; for example, in \"Quincea\u00f1era\", she completely takes control of the plans for Alex's [[Quincea\u00f1era]] fifteenth [[birthday]] party and turns it into the party that she wants, attempting to manipulate Alex into letting her. She refuses to listen to Alex's objections all because she herself never got to have a Quincea\u00f1era of her own. This eventually gets so irritating to Alex that she casts a spell to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] with her mother, partially so Theresa would be able to have the Quincea\u00f1era that she never got to have.\n\nTheresa is the reason why Jerry could not keep his wizard powers. Since wizards are not allowed to marry non-wizards, Jerry chose to give up his powers to his younger brother Kelbo in order to marry Theresa, as was revealed in season one's \"Alex in the Middle\" \u2013 previously unbeknownst to Justin, Alex and Max. However, Jerry says he does not regret marrying her.\n\nIt has been mentioned several times that Theresa doesn't like magic, and that she feels left out due to the rest of her family all being wizards at some point. She also finds it difficult to live in a house full of wizards, especially when her children (and sometimes, Jerry) misuse magic in the house, most notably when the boys of the family want to play indoors and either directly or indirectly end up destroying a prized lamp she owns. An example of this is in season one's \"Art Museum Piece\", when a spell which causes Theresa to go through objects wears off\u2014and she accidentally walks into the front door and she exclaims \"I hate living with wizards!\". She has also been shown to have very little concern for major issues in the magical world, which don't concern her. She also can be annoyed by the magic futility, was visible in \"''All bout You-niverse''\", when Alex broken a magical mirror (and thus trapping herself in a parallel universe), Theresa find out that fixing a magical mirror is no different from fixing a normal mirror, and she remarks \"''Magic is lame''\". Despite this, when Alex and Justin's antics cause Max to fail the wand quiz in \"''My Tutor, Tutor''\", Theresa lends a sympathetic ear to his problem (even supporting his plans to get revenge), and even told Alex to use her magic to make their haunted house scarier in \"''Halloween''\". In \"''Positive Alex''\", Theresa and Jerry realized that Alex had put a spell on herself to become positive, and they agree to do nothing against it, because they believe that there's nothing wrong in being positive, though they quickly change their minds when the newly optimistic Alex turns out to be unbearably annoying.\n\nThough normally, Theresa is a kind and caring mother, but she has a prevalent selfish side. For example, in \"Retest\", when Alex, Max, and Justin were upset over the possibility of losing their powers, Theresa relished the thought of having a normal family, going so far as to suggest turning the wizard lair into a den and, although she has no intention in hurting them, Theresa often hints this fact in a very unkind form. Similarly, in \"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place\", she openly refused to let Justin date Juliet at first and freely stated she cared more about her business than her children's happiness, which even Alex was appalled and disgusted by. Alex then cut into the argument as Justin was losing it badly against their parents and fixed everything up, ending with Justin able to date Juliet and their parents happy. In \"Marathon Helper\", Theresa was too shamed and upset with her family's lack of physical attributes that she said none of her own children are members of her family, openly added Harper is her only daughter, since Harper had taken it on herself to be involved in healthy activities, and later, she goes farther, hurting Justin's feelings by her saying she was not proud of his academic success. Both in \"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place 2\" and in \"Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie,\" she openly remarks since she is the Russos' mother, she doesn't need to care about their opinions and in more than one occasion, she arrogantly expressed the belief that she is immune to the Wizard Rules, since that she isn't (unfortunately, the \"''Wizard''\" Rules apply to all normal and supernatural beings that is aware of the Wizard World.). In the episode \"Alex's Logo\", she was referred to as popular in school, though it turns out she was the first girl admitted to a formerly all-boys school. In \"Uncle Ernesto,\" Alex encourages her to invite her brother on her birthday, however, it goes wrong and she ends up with a crashed birthday party.\n\n===Jerry Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jerry Russo\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

He is also a former wizard, who chose to give up his powers to marry his wife Theresa, a mortal, due to a rule forbidding wizards to marry mortals. Jerry is [[Italian American]] (DeLuise also has Italian ancestry).<ref name=\"quinceanera\">''Wizards of Waverly Place'' episode: \"Quincea\u00f1era\"</ref>\n\nJerry Russo is the average father.He likes to anal his daughter (Alex) so hard that her anal bleeds. but he's a sexy beast He is stern, protective and is annoyed by Alex and Max constantly, and even by Justin occasionally. Unlike his children, he does not have powers any more; nonetheless, his children inherited their powers from him, with Max having a fascination of the magic normal humans can do such as microwave popcorn, Alex being a natural at magic yet using it recklessly, and Justin continually trying to improve his magic through knowledge. Jerry lives on Waverly Place, a street in downtown [[Manhattan]] with his mortal wife [[Theresa Russo]] ([[Maria Canals Barrera]]) and his children: middle daughter [[Alex Russo]] ([[Selena Gomez]]), eldest son [[Justin Russo (Wizards of Waverly Place)|Justin Russo]] ([[David Henrie]]), and youngest child [[Max Russo]] ([[Jake T. Austin]]). He owns a sandwich shop called the Waverly Sub Station with Theresa, where his children work, and, in the season one episode \"New Employee\" so did Alex's best friend [[Harper Finkle]] ([[Jennifer Stone]]), although they only did it so they could be together more often. It is mentioned in the season two episode \"Make It Happen\", that Jerry's original career plan was to be a bull rider. His most popular catchphrase is \"But-he-you-she-ALEX!\"\n\nJerry is the typical over-protective father towards his daughter. It was first shown in season one's \"First Kiss\" when Alex claimed to have had her first kiss. He said \"No! She's my little girl! What's his name? I'll make him cry!\" (it is almost immediately revealed that Alex lied about having had her first kiss, and when Justin teased her for it, she kissed the first random boy she deemed good enough to kiss in school the next day, who was Matt, giving him a kiss that lasted a few seconds long and catching him off guard by her blunt, surprising way \u2013 she had slammed his locker shut when he was using it, right before pulling him by the shirt to direct his face towards hers to be able to kiss \u2013 and when he finally recovered from it, he turned around and ran in the direction of Alex, calling out her name to presumably ask her on a date), and continued in \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\" from that same season, when he didn't want to teach her how to ride the carpet because he was afraid she would grow up and leave home. He also was seen putting babyish wallpaper on her walls. When Max is accidentally transformed into a little girl in \"Daddy's Little Girl,\" Jerry calls the new Max \"Maxine\" and dotes on her, which does not go unnoticed by a jealous Alex, who tries to get her father's attention to no avail. However, when he becomes aware of Alex's jealousy and sadness, Jerry apologizes to her, explaining that he only did so because Maxine reminds him of Alex when she was little and reassuring her that she will always be his little girl.\n\nHe normally isn't okay with her dating, such as in the first-season episode \"''Potion Commotion''\" when Alex said \"That's my new boyfriend!\" about her crush Brad Sherwood ([[Shane Lyons]]), he said \"I'll pick your new boyfriend!\" But later on when Brad complimented Jerry, he said \"I like your new boyfriend!\" When Alex began dating Dean ([[Daniel Samonas]]), he liked him at first until Alex revealed Dean wanted to kiss her in season two's \"''Alex's Brother, Maximan''\". Jerry said \"I never cared for that boy!,\" when he had just said the other day he liked Dean. When Alex pointed that out he said \"That's before I knew he wanted to kiss you! He was using me to get to you! And I fell for it!\" In \"Alex Charms a Boy\" Jerry is no longer overprotective because when he saw Alex and Mason kiss he smiled instead of freaking out, because he knew it was an honest and true relationship. He can be somewhat of a [[cheapskate]]; for example, in \"Taxi Dance\", he is unable to remember the number of the hospital room where Justin was born when he remembers his own lottery ticket number from that same day, and being so cheap that his antics resulted in Theresa [[Childbirth|giving birth]] to Alex in a taxicab instead of in a hospital. Notably, before this, Theresa told the kids that Jerry had tried to make her walk to the hospital while she was in labor, to which Jerry replied, \"I offered to push you in a shopping cart!\". More notable, in \"Western Show\", when Max's increase of intelligence and maturity make him apply for various colleges, instead of showing happiness for the success of his son, he was upset with the possibility of having to pay for his learning. Additionally, in \"Quincea\u00f1era,\" he is reduced to tears when Alex offers to tell him how much her Quincea\u00f1era cost.\n\nJerry is proud of his magical ancestry and teaches his children about the proper uses of magic in \"Wizard Training Class\" on Tuesdays and Thursdays, in the lair magically disguised as a food locker in the restaurant. However, his children often disobey his magic rules (Alex, most often being the case), and he has to punish them. He wants his kids to be great wizards, but also wants them to be able to live a life without using their powers since they may not have them in the future, as only one of them will get to keep his/her powers as an adult. Jerry has an younger brother named Kelbo ([[Jeff Garlin]]), who is seen in the season one episode \"''Alex in the Middle''\", who is the wizard in Jerry's family because Jerry had to give him the powers to marry Theresa. Jerry's children consider Kelbo to be more fun than Jerry, and Alex even decides to have Kelbo be her magic teacher, and is revealed to be irresponsible with magic (almost as much as Alex is sometimes) as is shown when Kelbo fails to stop a package of sea chimps that spouts a huge gush of water eventually flooding the wizard lair and turning Kelbo and Alex into sea chimps. Jerry ends up being the one who saves them both, and he reveals a secret that he has kept from Alex, Max and Justin: that he gave up his powers in order to marry Theresa, due to a rule forbidding wizards and mortals from marrying, thus relinquishing his powers to Kelbo in order to marry her. In \"''Retest''\" it is revealed that Jerry and Kelbo have a sister, Megan. Megan holds a grudge against Jerry for giving Kelbo his powers instead of her. She lives in an art studio in Paris where she paints pictures. She is similar to Alex because she, like Alex, loves Art and hates hard work, though, unlike Alex, she is unwilling or unable to apologize for her actions. It is most likely their parents are still alive because of references from Alex and Max. Such as in \"Future Harper\", when Alex is telling Harper about a wizard adventure about her and her brothers, Harper already knows the ending and tells Alex she already told her the story. Alex replies \"Oh my gosh I'm starting to sound like Grandma\".\n\nJerry also is a fan of the [[New York Mets]] and [[New York Jets]], he and Theresa accidentally made fools of themselves in front of Max's date's parents, because Max got confused between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera|New York Metropolitan Opera (The Met)]] while trying to find common interest between them and his date's parents, not realizing that they keep forgetting about the [[Intermission]] they usually believed the stories to \"end abruptly in the middle\". In several episodes of the series (more so in season one, than in other seasons), Jerry often makes a remark that accidentally insults Theresa, and quickly tries to correct his statement. Such an example is in season one's \"''Movies''\", in which Theresa tells Alex that no matter how old she gets that she is not too old to spend time with her family, Jerry responds \"Exactly, just look at your mother\". Alex then points out that Jerry accidentally called Theresa \"old\", and he attempts and fails to change the subject.\n\nIn ''Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie'', Jerry gives Justin the family wand and the spell book which Alex steals accidentally wishing her parents never met or fell in love, but it was resolved \u2013 ironically by Alex herself, the reckless one out of his three children, who also surprisingly won the Premature Family Wizard competition against Justin, as Justin was the favorite out of the three to win it but lost to Alex, who then gives up her powers so they could compete for their powers when they are old enough.\n\nJerry has made more than one mention of past friends of his youth, including \"[[Ponyboy Curtis|Ponyboy]]\" and [[John Bender (character)|John Bender]]; both names of rebellious teen characters in classic 80's pop-culture films, [[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]] and [[The Breakfast Club]], respectively. Aside from the names, no other specific connections or further implications seem to have been made connecting Jerry's youth and the events in these stories. It is revealed in \"Wizard for a Day\", that he does not need his magic powers anymore, because when Alex gave him [[Merlin]]'s hat for his birthday, granting the wearer magic powers for 24 hours, all he wished for was a sandwich, whereas he could've just as easily went downstairs to make a sandwich himself in the Sub Station. Feeling underwhelmed, Alex used the hat to convert the Sub Station into a milkshake bar from Jerry's youth. After seeing this, he reminisced about it for a few moments before asking Alex to change it back, though he changed his mind when he saw how many customers it attracted. He later told Alex that he doesn't need big exciting gifts, as he his satisfied enough with small and simple ones (referring to Justin's gift, a magic pencil sharpener made from a soup-can).\n\n==Recurring characters==\nThe following is a list of recurring characters in the Disney Channel sitcom ''Wizards of Waverly Place''.\n\n===Zeke Beakerman===\n'''Ezekiel 'Zeke' Beakerman'''<ref>\"Smarty Pants\", season 2, episode 1 has Zeke in the credits; in \"Movies\", season 1, episode 9 he is called \"Zack\".</ref> (Dan Benson) is Justin's best friend. Zeke is in the same grade as Justin. He attends Tribeca Prep and is in advanced chemistry along with Justin. He is also part of an Alien Language League; he and Justin often \"speak alien\" to each other. Zeke's first appearance was in \"Movies\", but strangely he was known as Zack Rosenblack. They later changed his name to Zeke. He is very impulsive and easygoing. He and Justin are also on the same Quiz Bowl team in \"Smarty Pants\". Zeke and Justin have tried out for several sports teams, but have apparently failed at all of them. In \"Fashion Week\", they somehow succeed at talking to models. Zeke got the role of Peter Pan in the school play in \"Fairy Tale\". In the episode \"Wizard For a Day\", he is upset when the real aliens do not understand his \"alien speak\". Zeke and Harper go to \"Zombie Prom\" together. He is also on the [[cheerleader|cheer squad]], as revealed in \"Positive Alex\". He runs against Justin in the campaign for student body president in \"Detention Election\", but later he votes for Justin. He continues to assist Justin as student body president. Zeke continues his relationship with Harper in \"Alex Russo, Matchmaker?\" In \"Wizards Unleashed\", Zeke and Harper take care of the sub station and share their first kiss. In \"Alex Russo, Matchmaker\", Zeke is revealed to have hydrophobia and in season 4 he finds out the Russos are wizards. He assists the Russos when possible, though his assistance usually turns more troublesome than helpful. He is present during the Russo siblings' competition and ceremony at the series finale.\n\n===Mr. Laritate===\n'''Mr. Herschel Laritate''' ([[Bill Chott]]) is the principal of Tribeca Prep High School, which is mentioned when he calls Alex Russo into the principal's office in \"Alex Does Good\". Humorously, it is shown in the same episode that Alex has been sent to the principal's office way too often (implying Alex is a delinquent student) to the point that the two have somewhat of regular routines down, such as serving drink and snacks to each other and complementing the office's new mural of horses. His last name, Laritate, is a pun of Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. He loves anything related to the [[Old West]], as seen in his daily life, such as wears cowboy hat and [[bolo tie]], uses terms from that era when speaking, and even decorates his office in that theme. When he was relieved from his position as principal in \"Western Show\", he choose to work as part-time employee in 'Wild Billy's Western Roundup'. He teaches History class, Marriage and Family class, and taught the Art class once as temporary teacher. Mr. Laritate also acts as the adviser of several activities at the school including the World School Summit at the U.N., Happy Helpers Club, Quiz Bowl, sport activities, and school plays. His alma mater is Clementine College as mentioned in \"Fairy Tale\", but later on he confessed that he does not have a college degree in \"Franken-Girl\". Nevertheless, he claimed to be able to provide a strong recommendation letter for Justin Russo to the said college.\n\nMr. Laritate considers Justin as a model student. On the contrary, he has an on-and-off relationship with Justin's sister, Alex, in that he is often disappointed in Alex's lack of work ethic and unwillingness to do well in school. In season two's \"Don't Rain on Justin's Parade\", Mr. Laritate calls Alex an evil genius, much to Alex's pleasure. However, it is evident that he cares about her through his many efforts to reach out to her. In \"Alex's Logo\", he is basically Alex's only friend because everybody became mad at Alex after she said what she really thought of them while giving a speech under truth spell. After Alex complains about everybody still being mad at her, even though it has been a week since the speech, Mr. Laritate then tries to help Alex by doing more embarrassing acts in the hope that everybody will turn their attention to him and forget what Alex has done. Unfortunately, he also incidentally embarrasses Alex on the microphone while doing so, resulting other students calling her the principal's BFF (Best Friend Forever). He gives all the students that then threw T-shirts at him detention. He also gave Alex, who did not throw a T-shirt, detention, in order to justify his \"student to principal\" relationship. However, she smiles at Mr. Laritate's and says \"thank you\", because she knows its just his another attempt to defuse tension between her and other students. It was also revealed in this episode that Mr. Laritate has somewhat a difficult relationship with his mother.\n\nIn season 4, Alex crashes Mr. Laritate's car during her driving lesson and he sees how grown up she has become when she confesses the truth to him. Mr. Laritate personally hands high school diploma to Alex and Harper Finkle during a makeshift graduation ceremony of Tribeca Prep class of 2011 in \"Wizards vs Asteroids\". He appeared last time in \"Get along Little Zombie\" in which he was temporarily turned into a zombie after he got bitten by one during his visit to Alex and Harper's apartment. Alex and Mason Greyback turned him back into human again using 'Zombie bites treatment' lotion. It is shown at the end of the episode that he is, apparently, willing to keep a close relationship to the Russo family.\n\n===Mason Greyback===\n'''Mason Greyback''' ([[Gregg Sulkin]]; seasons 3-4) is first mentioned in Season 2 episode ''Future Harper'' when Future Harper tells Alex that she seems irritable and asks if she broke up with Mason yet, implying that she will date a boy named Mason in the future.\n\nMason is first fully introduced as a student in Alex's art class, and as an English boy who has a crush on Alex. They later begin to date. Mason loves to paint. He gives Alex a necklace that lights up when the person who wears it is in love with the person who put it on them. It is revealed that he in fact is a [[werewolf]] but doesn't turn Alex into a werewolf when they kiss, because he is a purebred and only mutts turn people into werewolves when they kiss, referencing Justin's werewolf Wizface-date from the season 2 episode \"Beware Wolf\". He helps in the search for Juliet after picking up her scent from her dental floss. It is revealed that he and Juliet used to date (which also reveals Mason doesn't age) and he admits impulsively that he never stopped loving her, which breaks Alex's heart. She throws away the magic necklace he gave her (which lights up if the wearer is in love with the person who put it on them). He later tells Max that, like dogs, werewolves are incredibly loyal and impulsive, which explains why he couldn't contain himself when he saw Juliet, though his feelings for Alex are still present. He tries to prove his love for Alex by going back to the mummy's tomb to find the necklace. Justin, Max, and Juliet come to rescue Alex, even though Alex volunteered to go and wasn't in any real danger. Max likes Mason, but Justin hates him for breaking Alex's heart. When Justin tries to make Alex forcedly leave the tomb, Mason, being fiercely protective, turns into a werewolf, and starts fighting Justin and Juliet. He is attacking Justin when Juliet bites him, causing him to turn into a wolf permanently. Before his transformation, Alex puts the necklace on him and it lights up. Alex knows now that he truly loves her, but he leaves because as a wolf, he has no control. He leaves the mummy's tomb as he transforms into a wolf.\n\nIn ''Wizards Unleashed'', it is discovered that Mason has been captured by wizards and is being used in TV advertisements. Upon discovering this, Alex manages to retrieve him, and uses magic to revert the transformation, but only succeeds in leaving him with pointy ears, claws, and mass abounds of fur. Though Alex initially has trouble accepting Mason in this new state, she eventually gets over it and Justin manages to fully restore his humanity by playing a magical jawharp at the end of the episode. In \"Wizards Exposed,\" the wizards get caught, and Mason gets caught while he was \"admiring his hat.\"\n\nIn \"Alex Gives Up,\" they are forced to break up due to a rule that says that werewolves and non-wizards cannot date because the werewolf always ends up eating the human due to their anger management issues. At first, Chancellor Rootie Tootie Tootie appealed the rule, but then Alex, jealous of Lisa Cucuy, who was hitting on Mason, and makes Mason extremely angry by embarrassing him in front of her brother, her parents, and the Cucuy's. Mason then transforms into his half-werewolf form and Chancellor Tootie Tootie, seeing he is incapable of controlling his anger, takes back his appeal, therefore forcing Alex and Mason to break up. In \"Journey to the Center of Mason\", Mason eats Dean Moriarty (Alex's ex-boyfriend; they broke up when Dean had to move to Ohio) because he is jealous that Alex is spending time with Dean and not him. Alex, Justin, and Max go inside of Mason. While in Mason, Alex, Justin, and Max go into his brain. Alex sees that all Mason does is think about her. When Alex, Justin, and Max come out of him with Dean, Dean leaves because Alex doesn't want him back. After he leaves, Alex and Mason get back together because Alex decided to rejoin the Wizard Competition so she and Mason could be together. In the episode, Dean only refers to Mason as \"London Bridges\". Mason has the deepest love for Alex and has nicknamed her 'Brown Eyes', 'Little Meatball', and 'Love'. In \"Wizard of the Year\", Alex breaks up with him for the third time because of his mistrust of her and a monster tamer named Chase.\n\nIn the episodes of \"Wizards of Apartment 13B\", Alex and Harper move into an apartment on the thirteenth floor where coincidentally Mason is living at. Mason stops at nothing to win Alex back; using Harper's training wand to open Alex's heart to him. Though this turns out for the worse as Alex begins to flirt with an ugly ogre and Felix. In \"Ghost Roommate\", Mason goes on a date with Lucy, a ghost who is living with Alex and Harper. Alex is jealous that Mason and Lucy went on a date and proceed to find Lucy's long lost true love. Alex is then stuck on the Bermuda Triangle, where magic can't be used. Mason comes to her rescue using Justin's hideous Bermuda shorts. In \"Get Along, Little Zombie\", Mason is still determined to ask Alex out on a date and even breaking the elevator to spend some time with Alex; exposing the magical thirteenth floor to non-magical residents. Soon, Mr. Laritate discovers the thirteenth floor and gets bitten by a zombie; subsequently gets turned into a zombie. Mason and Alex go on a wild goose chase trying to find Mr. Laritate and end up in a square dance. Alex then realizes that she wants Mason back while Mason was trying to say that maybe he and Alex should just be friends. At the end of the episode, it is shown that Mason and Alex do get back together. In \"Who Will be the Family Wizard\", Mason comes to the wizard competition to cheer on Alex. He and Juliet meet once again and tell each other no hard feelings from the events that took place in \"Wizards vs. Werewolves\". Also when Alex loses the competition, he and Alex look deeply saddened due to her losing and ponder breaking up. However, Justin realizes how much Alex needs to win to be happy, and so reveals she would have won if she hadn't gone back for him and he didn't really win like everyone thought he did. Alex becomes the Russo family wizard and is able to stay with Mason. In \"The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex\", Mason gets jealous over the evil wizard, Dominic, who flirts with Alex. Mason breaks Alex out of jail before she can be exiled, and he throws Dominic off the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n\n===Juliet van Heusen===\n'''Juliet van Heusen''' ([[Bridgit Mendler]]; seasons 2-4) is a teenage [[vampire]] who is Justin Russo's main love interest. When she was born, her parents let her have a soul so she could socialize in the human world. This also makes her more compassionate than most vampires, who are usually heartless and cunning. She is characterized as a beautiful girl with blonde hair and rather pale skin. She wears vanilla-scented perfume to hide her true vampire scent of death and decay in an attempt to avoid detection by monster hunters. She is also a health-conscious girl who has certain diet on her menu. Juliet's development as a vampire is very slow, as her fangs have just started to grow at a late age for a vampire. She is also shown to not want to drink blood, and even tries to persuade her parents to abstain from drinking blood. As a very unusual character for a vampire, this trait is used for comic effect, especially when she empties a berliner with her fangs.\n\nAt first, Juliet and Justin were not allowed to date by their respective parents due to their restaurants' rivalry. However, the two fight for their love and soon are allowed to date. In \"Night at the Lazerama\", Juliet accompanies Justin on his monster-hunt for a [[mummy]]. Unfortunately, they become trapped in a glass display near a [[skylight|glass roof]], which would cause Juliet to burn up in the morning. Since the mummy is the only one that is able to take Juliet out from the glass display, Justin decides that the only way to save Juliet's life is to turn her into the mummy's slave. Nevertheless, he promises to save her one day. The mummy then takes Juliet to [[Transylvania]], where she is forcibly imprisoned in [[suspended animation]] behind [[Hieroglyphics]], though she never gives up hope that Justin will save her. In \"Wizards vs. Werewolves\", Justin indeed saves her, and then it is revealed that she once dated Mason Greyback, Alex's [[werewolf]] boyfriend, 300 years ago. This fact makes Justin rather jealous towards Mason, leads to a fight between the two. Juliet intervenes when Justin and Mason fight, and Mason scratches Juliet and, in turn, Juliet bites Mason, resulting in Mason turning into a wolf and Juliet is stripped of her vampire powers. This causes her to rapidly age into an old woman, since she is truly 2,193 years old. Because of this, Justin and Juliet are forced to end their relationship, both of them heartbroken.\n\nIn \"Moving On\", Juliet appears again, happy to witness that Justin apparently has forgotten her and moved on. However, Justin and Juliet reunite towards the end of season 4, since, actually, none of them has stopped loving each other. Juliet gets her vampire powers and youth back when Gorog (the leader of dark angels) gives them to her in an effort to tempt Justin to join the Dark Side. However, the Russos defeat Gorog, releasing Juliet from his influence. Juliet comes to support Justin at the Russo family's wizard competition, where she and Mason meet and both acknowledge that no hard feelings left from the events that took place in \"Wizards vs. Werewolves\". When Justin takes Professor Crumbs' place as headmaster of WizTech, Juliet says she's even happier about that.\n\n===Dean Moriarty===\n'''Dean Moriarty''' ([[Daniel Samonas]]; seasons 2 and 4) is Alex's boyfriend in the second season. He makes temporary tattoos in the boys bathroom and is interested in cars. In episode \"Racing\" he charmed Alex's parents with his car skills, though he revealed to Alex that he only did it to make a good first impression by being polite. It is also revealed in that episode, that he was raised by his Uncle, as he exclaimed proudly \"my Uncle raised me with manners\". Harper and Justin aren't too fond of him and Jerry seems the same way later on, though this is partly due to Jerry being an overprotective father after learning that he is dating Alex. He can never remember Harper's name. In the episode \"Alex's Brother Maximan\" it was shown he likes roller skating and playing with the claw game and winning stuffed animals. The only thing Alex doesn't like about him is that he's horrible at showing his feelings, as shown in \"Saving Wiz Tech Part 1\", but it changed in \"Saving Wiz Tech Part 2\". He does not appear to be academically inclined, as Alex noticed a false good grade on his wooden assignment/gift for her (it was a D changed to a B), and he also stated that he does not \"test well\", meaning he doesn't see himself as book-smart. He moved away sometime after that, so Alex visited him in his dreams in \"Wizards vs Vampires: Dream Date\"; she then saw how they were growing apart, so they broke up. But he returned in Season 4 \"Journey to the Center of Mason\" because he wanted to get back together, though she denied it because she likes Mason, and Mason eats him out of jealousy. Dean is later rescued by Alex, Justin, and Max, and learns that Alex has chosen Mason and agrees to back off.\n\n===Professor Crumbs===\n'''Professor Crumbs''' ([[Ian Abercrombie]]) is the headmaster of WizTech (a reference to [[Albus Dumbledore]]). In \"Wizard School\", he is often seen holding a muffin. (The muffin's crumbs fall into his beard, hence the name \"Crumbs\".) Professor Crumbs is never seen without his incredibly long beard, even when he was turned into a guinea pig in the episode \"Report Card\". The only episode where he has been seen without his beard is in part two of season two's \"Saving WizTech\" when Ronald Longcape, Jr. (Chad Duell) took the beard from him, revealing that it was a fake beard all this time. After he was defeated, Crumbs took his beard back. Crumbs is shown how to socialize by Max in \"Saving WizTech\" and has done some childish things, such as spitting over the edge of the Tower of Evil. In season two's \"Saving WizTech\", he states that he is 850 years old. He speaks with a British accent, which Alex sometimes makes fun of. Another thing that Alex makes fun of is the fact that he has a smelly beard revealed in ''Wizards Exposed''. In the season 3 finale, he appears to be captured by a government agency with the rest of the wizard elite. However, the season 4 premiere reveals it was all an illusion Crumbs created to \"test\" Justin and Alex. As each broke it by revealing to government agents and reporters (all also illusions), Crumbs forces them both to start at level 1 of their wizard lessons; however, after seeing how remarkably unintelligent Max was, he regretted his choice. When Justin and Max change him back into a kid, in their attempt to trick him into revealing how to undo a mutant spell they cast on Max that turned him into a little girl, it's revealed that everyone in Crumbs' family has a beard even as a kid. In the four-part episode revolving around Floor 13B, Professor Crumbs was surprised about a wizard floor that he did not know of and ended up discovering that Gorog was behind it. Professor Crumbs was captured by Gorog alongside the other inhabitants and was later rescued by the Russos upon Gorog's defeat. In the end of the series finale, Crumbs announces Alex as the Family Wizard and that he is retiring, and makes Justin Russo ([[David Henrie]]) the new headmaster of WizTech, thus also granting Justin his full magic powers.\n\n===Hugh Normous===\n'''Hugh Normous''' ([[Josh Sussman]]; seasons 1-2 and 4) was Alex's Wiz Tech friend he first appeared in \"Wizard School.\" His name is a pun of the word \"enormous\", it is also an irony considering that he isn't a real giant, as pointed out by Alex when he introduced himself and she responded with \"Not Really\". At first, he believed himself to be a giant, since his parents are giants, but that he's the runt of the litter, so he carries around miniature everyday objects to boost his self-esteem; humorously, he also wears underpants and glasses too small for himself. He later appeared in season 2 episode ''Saving Wiz Tech'' where he showed Alex his friend Ronald Longcape Jr he later appears in ''Harper Knows'' and ''Hugh's not Normous'' where he discovers that he is adopted and that he is not a real giant. He eventually meets his birth parents and goes to live with them, but he doesn't resent his adoptive parents. Hugh is a giant in the sense of, when he met his birth parents, he was markedly taller than both of them, with both of them commenting on his larger size. Presumably, after discovering this, he stopped his habit of carrying miniature objects and started wearing regular-sized clothes. He does not appear in season 3 or the movie. He returned in ''Ghost Roommate'', still thinking he is a giant.\n\n===Kelbo Russo===\n'''Kelbo Russo''' ([[Jeff Garlin]]; seasons 1-3) is the uncle of Alex, Justin and Max, brother of Jerry and Megan and brother-in-law of Theresa. Unlike Jerry, he is very fun and carefree. Kelbo is a full wizard (Jerry had originally won the competition, but gave up his powers to marry a mortal) who often uses his powers very childishly, and often seems just as irresponsible with them as Alex is with her own. As a recurring gag, in every episode he appears in during the post credits scenes, he makes a prank call to someone.\n\nHe first appears in \"Alex In the Middle\", and temporarily becomes Alex's wizard tutor. He reappears in \"Retest\", it is requested that he, Jerry and their sister Megan re-do their wizard competition, but when Megan refuses, Kelbo hires a magical fish-lawyer to help them, but after he informs that there is nothing that he can do, Kelbo decides to move to Atlantis for good. He appears once again in \"Dude Looks Like Shakira\", and reveals that he is [[Shakira]], but also added that what he has been doing is against the wizard rules, and can no longer control his transformations. The Russos eventually cure him of his illness (though Shakira's career-end isn't mentioned afterwards).

Austin]]). The three Russo siblings are wizards in training and live with their [[Italian-American]] father Jerry ([[David DeLuise]]), a former wizard, and their [[Mexican-American]] mother, Theresa ([[Maria Canals Barrera]]) who is a mortal. Alex's best friend Harper ([[Jennifer Stone]]) also found out about the Russos' wizard powers in season 2. The siblings have to keep their secret safe while living in the mortal world. When they become adults, the three siblings will have a wizard competition to decide who will become the family wizard of their generation and keep his or her wizard powers. Harper used to have a crush on Justin, but now is in love with Justin's best friend, Zeke, who finds out about the Russo's wizard powers in season 4. Alex Russo ([[Selena Gomez]]) and Justin Russo ([[David Henrie]]) are the only characters to appear in every episode of the series.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Alex Russo===\n{{main|Alex Russo}}\n'''Alexandra Margarita Russo''' ([[Selena Gomez]]) is the only female out of the three Russo siblings, and the middle child. She is sly, rebellious, outgoing, and usually underachieves when it comes to school. She often gets into trouble because of her constant schemes (usually involving magic). She is part [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] and part [[Italians|Italian]]. Even though she is infamously known for doing the worst in wizard studies and school, and relentlessly torments her older brother Justin, Alex becomes much more mature throughout the series. Although she's somewhat lazy, Alex is smart, loyal, and caring. She goes through a long-term relationship with Mason Greyback, a purebred werewolf. She becomes the Russo family wizard at the end of the series. Usually, her mom calls her \"m'ija\", which is Spanish for \"my daughter\".\n\n===Justin Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = '''Justin Russo'''\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| first              = \"[[Wizards_of_Waverly_Place_(season_1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"<br>1x01, October 12, 2007\n| last               = \"Who Will Be The Family Wizard\"<br />4x28, January 6, 2012\n| creator            = Todd J.

He is very smart, and is often considered a nerd. He is in numerous clubs and has learned over 5000 spells. He continues his wizard studies in a Monster Hunting course. For his knowledge in wizardry, he takes after his father Jerry, who originally won the Wizard Family Competition against Kelbo and Megan. Unlike Alex, he is an overachiever when it comes to school. He is fairly athletic, and very respectful to his parents and other adults. Justin is responsible, sensible, kindhearted and hardworking, but can be a little sarcastic to Alex and Max. He revealed to Alex that he is jealous of her because he felt she is blessed with magic skills that he can't live up to, and it's reinforced when he refers to Alex as \"daddy's little princess\" (a unique, and often favoring, bond between a father and daughter). This is what drives him to be a better wizard. Alex consoles him by stating that he is her rock and foundation, and that she is actually jealous of his academic achievements, even though she openly admits to not caring about school. He has a long-term relationship with Juliet Van Heusen, a teenage vampire whose family runs the \"Late Night Bite\" (local competition for the [[Waverly Sub Station]]), which prompted a feud between the Russos and the Van Heusens. At first, their love is a forbidden romance, which Alex points out by referencing [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet]], but then they eventually start dating openly. Justin reveals to Alex that Juliet is his true love, after he felt heartbroken about being unable to see her due to the feuding families. Justin gets heartbroken again when Juliet was forced to break up with him due to her getting scratched by Mason the werewolf, as she stated that when that happens a vampire's appearance will revert to their true age.\n\nLater in the series, Alex tells the world that they are wizards and her and Justin's levels move down, so he makes a class with students who got kicked out of WizTech and later falls in love with an angel named Rosie.\n\nAt first, it seems that Justin won the Wizard Competition after being the first to cross the finish line, and he was about to be granted his full powers, when he says that he can't accept it because he didn't really win; Alex would have won if she hadn't come to back to help him, and he says that she deserves to be the Russo family wizard. Because of his honesty, Professor Crumbs allows both Justin and Alex to keep their powers and for Justin to take over as Headmaster of Wiz Tech.\n\nLater in the series he reconciles with Juliet after she regains her youthful appearance.\n\n===Max Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Max Russo\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| caption            = Austin attending the premiere of ''[[The Perfect Game]]'' on April 16, 2010\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

Austin]]) is the youngest of the three Russo siblings. Alex and Justin's magic are more advanced than Max's (as shown by the wands). Although he is an underachiever in the beginning, he advances more during the series. At first, he does not seem to be very bright, but this is later revealed to be due to a lack of focus and a short attention span, as he becomes an A+ model student when their school introduces uniforms, claiming it helps him focus. Alex and Justin are embarrassed and annoyed by his lack of intelligence, but they do occasionally take advantage of it, for example: When they tried to lure in a Genie back to her lamp, Alex suggested that after the Genie outsmarted them, they might be able to out-dumb her, and immediately asked Max what he'd do to get her back to grant him a wish. The Genie eventually allows him a wish, to which he responded with describing his appearance, which prompted the Genie to unintentionally reveal that there is a reset-button. He once revealed to Juliet, that he uses \"randomness\" to allow others to inadvertently reveal their true thoughts and feelings to him, though he later admitted that he still has no idea what is going on around him. He is very fond of skateboards. In the episode \"Three Maxes and a Little Lady\", Justin and Alex fall behind in the Wizard Competition, and Max gets a wish, which he uses to wish for the Wizard Competition to begin that day. However, both Alex and Justin use magic to turn into Max and reverse The Wish, to no avail. Max eventually decides to bump back the Wizard Competition; however, Alex and Justin cross spells and turn Max into Maxine, a girl version of him. In \"Who Will be the Family Wizard\", Max's powers are taken away, but Jerry and Teresa decide to give him The Sub Station, much to his happiness. Personality wise, Max takes after his Uncle Kelbo.\n\nMax is played by [[Jake T. Austin]] (also [[Bailee Madison]] as Maxine in season four).\n\n===Harper Finkle===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Harper Finkle\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| caption            = Stone attending \"The 6th Annual Hollywood Style Awards\" Beverly Hills, CA, Oct. 10, 2009\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\" <small>\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

Harper is a typical teenager, being self-expressive, but a little insecure at times. Unlike Alex, she is a hard-working student and a fairly positive person, but still connects well with Alex. Jennifer Stone does not appear as Harper in \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\" (which was actually the first episode produced, but the sixth episode broadcast\u2014the episode was aired out of production order).\n\nHarper is known for her outrageous fashion ensembles that she designs herself, most of which are \"food-themed\", such as one outfit seen in the season one episode \"Credit Check\" which resembled a cupcake. No one ever tells her that her fashion designs are (for the most part) ridiculous, but it is implied that everyone else thinks it. Not only does she create her own clothes, but she also makes her own jewelry as seen in the episode \"Art Museum Piece\", when she starts a booth selling her necklaces made of macaroni, glitter, and knobs from Alex's room. Despite her unseemly fashion choices, she believes it is better to stand out as an individual, and is confident that she will excel at whatever she tries, no matter what people think, and has a habit of laughing out loud when the atmosphere gets tense.\n\nShe was oblivious of the fact that Alex, Max and Justin are wizards until the episode \"Harper Knows\" when Alex finally told her because she felt guilty for not telling the truth to her best friend. This was also the first time Harper experienced the use of magic when Alex gave her a charmed costume with super powers. She is often paranoid of Alex's schemes, especially after she finds out about magic, but reluctantly gets involved anyway. Despite Alex's controlling and manipulative behavior, Harper always sees the good side in Alex and is willing to be accepting of her due to their friendship, to the point where she was the only person who believed that Alex wouldn't participate in a plot that, if successful, would prevent young wizards losing their powers in the Competition. She has known Alex since kindergarten and is always there when Alex needs support. In season three it is revealed that Harper is a [[cheerleader]], which is the only secret Harper has ever kept from Alex, largely due to Alex's typical disdain and mocking attitude towards cheerleaders.\n\nHarper's parents are featured in \"Wizards vs Finkles\" as traveling showpeople from Romania. They ask Harper to rejoin them for shows but Harper refuses, happy with her life with the Russos while Alex, fascinated with their lifestyle, accept in Harper's place. In the end the commitment and hard work drives Alex away, with Harper's parents leaving for Youngstown, Ohio, for a new gig on good terms with Harper and the rest of the Russos. In \"Meet the Werewolves\" it is revealed that Harper was born in Nebraska, backstage in a night club, most likely at one of her parent's shows. In \"Wizards vs. Vampires: Tasty Bites\", when Alex is so fed up with her family's new healthy living, she says, ''\"I'm so desperate, I'm thinking about going to Harper's house\"'', meaning that Harper's house is wild. In \"Alex Does Good\", Harper blurts out, ''\"It's about time I got some appreciation, Mom!\"'', claiming that her mom doesn't appreciate her. Harper moves in with Alex and the Russos in season three, most likely because of her home. (Although it was also motivated by her father's recent transfer to Pittsburgh and her unwillingness to leave Alex).\n\nIn the episode \"Future Harper\", it's revealed that Harper becomes a famous author, who writes books based on the Russos' wizard adventures, and writes under the name \"H.J. Darling\" (parody of [[J. K. Rowling]]). Alex, Justin, and Max find this out when they go to confront the author of the books (seven books in the series ''Charmed and Dangerous'') that mysteriously mimic their lives. As the older Harper ([[Rachel Dratch]]) tells them, she writes her books in the present day because in the future, wizards and magic in general have been outed, and books about magic are no longer so interesting. She doesn't tell the Russo kids who it was that revealed the existence of wizards, other than it happens to be one of the three; the Alex and Justin suspect it to be Max, to which he is first appalled but then agrees (though in a later episode the Russos are questioned by the government and they trick Justin into revealing that wizards exist, though this turned out to be a false exposure); and that she came back in time with the aid of one of the most powerful wizards of all time. It is unknown if she ever marries someone with the last name Darling, or if she just uses the name H.J. Darling as a way to keep her identity safe in the present day.\n\nIn the episode \"Third Wheel\", after it is discovered Stevie is a wizard, Alex starts hanging out with her more, neglecting Harper. Later in the episode, Harper confronts Alex on how she has been feeling left out. This leads to a heated argument, where Harper reveals her insecurities about how Alex is always taking her for granted and yet she never holds it against her. During this argument, they end up destroying the Homecoming float, which Justin tricked Harper into helping him build by disguising himself as Alex. Mr. Laritate witnesses this and threatens to have Alex expelled. For the sake of their friendship, Harper takes all the blame. Mr. Laritate believes her, considering that Alex never tells the truth, and punishes Harper with one week of detention. Later, Alex somehow sneaks into the detention room and apologizes for what happened. Forgiving her, Harper explains that she only did it because even if Stevie is Alex's new best friend, it's not going to keep her from being a friend to Alex. Alex compassionately says that her relationship with Harper is much stronger than it is with Stevie, by saying that Stevie is her ''friend'', but Harper is her ''sister''. When Stevie later appears to recruit Alex to aid her in a plot to destroy the power transference technology and thus prevent any younger wizards from losing their powers in the competition, Harper continues to believe that Alex will come through and do the right thing even when Justin is convinced that Alex has gone evil. Alex warmly thanks Harper for her faith in her after her true agenda is revealed when she freezes Stevie and allows Stevie's brother Warren to inherit his full powers.\n\nAt times, Jerry and Theresa like to take credit for Harper being their daughter, as in the episode \"Marathoner Helper\". Justin then says, \"C'mon, she's not your daughter.\" And as Alex walks in eating a hot dog with cereal he says, \"That's your daughter.\"\n\nShe usually shouts \"See ya in PE\" and screams when she is scared or nervous. In \"Helping Hand\", she screams while laughing stating she is scared and happy.\n\n===Theresa Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Theresa Russo\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"\n</small>\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

Theresa is [[Mexican American]] (as a [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]], Canals Barrera has [[Spanish (people)|Spanish]] ancestry through her Cuban parents).<ref name=\"youcantalways\">''Wizards of Waverly Place'' episode: \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\"</ref>\n\nTheresa Russo is a typical mother. She's fussy, caring and can be pretty embarrassing. Unlike her children, she is a mortal. She dislikes magic, probably because she was once possessed by a wizard's love spell for twelve years. Theresa lives on Waverly Place in Manhattan with her husband (and former wizard) [[Jerry Russo]] ([[David DeLuise]]) and her children: middle daughter [[Alex Russo]] ([[Selena Gomez]]), eldest son [[Justin Russo (Wizards of Waverly Place)|Justin Russo]] ([[David Henrie]]), and youngest child [[Max Russo]] ([[Jake T. Austin]]). She owns a sandwich shop called the [[Waverly Sub Station]] with her husband in which her children work. She is overprotective of Justin and Max, but Max especially. She tries to relate with her kids but it doesn't always work.\n\nTheresa stated that she is a \"''Proud Latina''\" and tries to get her children to learn about her and their [[Mexico|Mexican]] heritage. In season one's \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\", Theresa states that she once played guitar in an all-girl mariachi band \u2014 though when Justin says \"I didn't know you played the guitar\", Jerry says \"she doesn't\" \u2013 implying that Theresa is not a very good guitar player. This is shown in season 3.\n\nAt times, Theresa can be controlling of her kids and their lives; for example, in \"Quincea\u00f1era\", she completely takes control of the plans for Alex's [[Quincea\u00f1era]] fifteenth [[birthday]] party and turns it into the party that she wants, attempting to manipulate Alex into letting her. She refuses to listen to Alex's objections all because she herself never got to have a Quincea\u00f1era of her own. This eventually gets so irritating to Alex that she casts a spell to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] with her mother, partially so Theresa would be able to have the Quincea\u00f1era that she never got to have.\n\nTheresa is the reason why Jerry could not keep his wizard powers. Since wizards are not allowed to marry non-wizards, Jerry chose to give up his powers to his younger brother Kelbo in order to marry Theresa, as was revealed in season one's \"Alex in the Middle\" \u2013 previously unbeknownst to Justin, Alex and Max. However, Jerry says he does not regret marrying her.\n\nIt has been mentioned several times that Theresa doesn't like magic, and that she feels left out due to the rest of her family all being wizards at some point. She also finds it difficult to live in a house full of wizards, especially when her children (and sometimes, Jerry) misuse magic in the house, most notably when the boys of the family want to play indoors and either directly or indirectly end up destroying a prized lamp she owns. An example of this is in season one's \"Art Museum Piece\", when a spell which causes Theresa to go through objects wears off\u2014and she accidentally walks into the front door and she exclaims \"I hate living with wizards!\". She has also been shown to have very little concern for major issues in the magical world, which don't concern her. She also can be annoyed by the magic futility, was visible in \"''All bout You-niverse''\", when Alex broken a magical mirror (and thus trapping herself in a parallel universe), Theresa find out that fixing a magical mirror is no different from fixing a normal mirror, and she remarks \"''Magic is lame''\". Despite this, when Alex and Justin's antics cause Max to fail the wand quiz in \"''My Tutor, Tutor''\", Theresa lends a sympathetic ear to his problem (even supporting his plans to get revenge), and even told Alex to use her magic to make their haunted house scarier in \"''Halloween''\". In \"''Positive Alex''\", Theresa and Jerry realized that Alex had put a spell on herself to become positive, and they agree to do nothing against it, because they believe that there's nothing wrong in being positive, though they quickly change their minds when the newly optimistic Alex turns out to be unbearably annoying.\n\nThough normally, Theresa is a kind and caring mother, but she has a prevalent selfish side. For example, in \"Retest\", when Alex, Max, and Justin were upset over the possibility of losing their powers, Theresa relished the thought of having a normal family, going so far as to suggest turning the wizard lair into a den and, although she has no intention in hurting them, Theresa often hints this fact in a very unkind form. Similarly, in \"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place\", she openly refused to let Justin date Juliet at first and freely stated she cared more about her business than her children's happiness, which even Alex was appalled and disgusted by. Alex then cut into the argument as Justin was losing it badly against their parents and fixed everything up, ending with Justin able to date Juliet and their parents happy. In \"Marathon Helper\", Theresa was too shamed and upset with her family's lack of physical attributes that she said none of her own children are members of her family, openly added Harper is her only daughter, since Harper had taken it on herself to be involved in healthy activities, and later, she goes farther, hurting Justin's feelings by her saying she was not proud of his academic success. Both in \"Wizards vs. Vampires on Waverly Place 2\" and in \"Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie,\" she openly remarks since she is the Russos' mother, she doesn't need to care about their opinions and in more than one occasion, she arrogantly expressed the belief that she is immune to the Wizard Rules, since that she isn't (unfortunately, the \"''Wizard''\" Rules apply to all normal and supernatural beings that is aware of the Wizard World.). In the episode \"Alex's Logo\", she was referred to as popular in school, though it turns out she was the first girl admitted to a formerly all-boys school. In \"Uncle Ernesto,\" Alex encourages her to invite her brother on her birthday, however, it goes wrong and she ends up with a crashed birthday party.\n\n===Jerry Russo===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jerry Russo\n| series             = [[Wizards of Waverly Place]]\n| first              = \"[[Wizards of Waverly Place (season 1)#ep1|Crazy 10-Minute Sale]]\"\n| last               = \"[[The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex]]\"\n| creator            = Todd J.

He is also a former wizard, who chose to give up his powers to marry his wife Theresa, a mortal, due to a rule forbidding wizards to marry mortals. Jerry is [[Italian American]] (DeLuise also has Italian ancestry).<ref name=\"quinceanera\">''Wizards of Waverly Place'' episode: \"Quincea\u00f1era\"</ref>\n\nJerry Russo is the average father. He is stern, protective and is annoyed by Alex and Max constantly, and even by Justin occasionally. Unlike his children, he does not have powers any more; nonetheless, his children inherited their powers from him, with Max having a fascination of the magic normal humans can do such as microwave popcorn, Alex being a natural at magic yet using it recklessly, and Justin continually trying to improve his magic through knowledge. Jerry lives on Waverly Place, a street in downtown [[Manhattan]] with his mortal wife [[Theresa Russo]] ([[Maria Canals Barrera]]) and his children: middle daughter [[Alex Russo]] ([[Selena Gomez]]), eldest son [[Justin Russo (Wizards of Waverly Place)|Justin Russo]] ([[David Henrie]]), and youngest child [[Max Russo]] ([[Jake T. Austin]]). He owns a sandwich shop called the Waverly Sub Station with Theresa, where his children work, and, in the season one episode \"New Employee\" so did Alex's best friend [[Harper Finkle]] ([[Jennifer Stone]]), although they only did it so they could be together more often. It is mentioned in the season two episode \"Make It Happen\", that Jerry's original career plan was to be a bull rider. His most popular catchphrase is \"But-he-you-she-ALEX!\"\n\nJerry is the typical over-protective father towards his daughter. It was first shown in season one's \"First Kiss\" when Alex claimed to have had her first kiss. He said \"No! She's my little girl! What's his name? I'll make him cry!\" (it is almost immediately revealed that Alex lied about having had her first kiss, and when Justin teased her for it, she kissed the first random boy she deemed good enough to kiss in school the next day, who was Matt, giving him a kiss that lasted a few seconds long and catching him off guard by her blunt, surprising way \u2013 she had slammed his locker shut when he was using it, right before pulling him by the shirt to direct his face towards hers to be able to kiss \u2013 and when he finally recovered from it, he turned around and ran in the direction of Alex, calling out her name to presumably ask her on a date), and continued in \"You Can't Always Get What You Carpet\" from that same season, when he didn't want to teach her how to ride the carpet because he was afraid she would grow up and leave home. He also was seen putting babyish wallpaper on her walls. When Max is accidentally transformed into a little girl in \"Daddy's Little Girl,\" Jerry calls the new Max \"Maxine\" and dotes on her, which does not go unnoticed by a jealous Alex, who tries to get her father's attention to no avail. However, when he becomes aware of Alex's jealousy and sadness, Jerry apologizes to her, explaining that he only did so because Maxine reminds him of Alex when she was little and reassuring her that she will always be his little girl.\n\nHe normally isn't okay with her dating, such as in the first-season episode \"''Potion Commotion''\" when Alex said \"That's my new boyfriend!\" about her crush Brad Sherwood ([[Shane Lyons]]), he said \"I'll pick your new boyfriend!\" But later on when Brad complimented Jerry, he said \"I like your new boyfriend!\" When Alex began dating Dean ([[Daniel Samonas]]), he liked him at first until Alex revealed Dean wanted to kiss her in season two's \"''Alex's Brother, Maximan''\". Jerry said \"I never cared for that boy!,\" when he had just said the other day he liked Dean. When Alex pointed that out he said \"That's before I knew he wanted to kiss you! He was using me to get to you! And I fell for it!\" In \"Alex Charms a Boy\" Jerry is no longer overprotective because when he saw Alex and Mason kiss he smiled instead of freaking out, because he knew it was an honest and true relationship. He can be somewhat of a [[cheapskate]]; for example, in \"Taxi Dance\", he is unable to remember the number of the hospital room where Justin was born when he remembers his own lottery ticket number from that same day, and being so cheap that his antics resulted in Theresa [[Childbirth|giving birth]] to Alex in a taxicab instead of in a hospital. Notably, before this, Theresa told the kids that Jerry had tried to make her walk to the hospital while she was in labor, to which Jerry replied, \"I offered to push you in a shopping cart!\". More notable, in \"Western Show\", when Max's increase of intelligence and maturity make him apply for various colleges, instead of showing happiness for the success of his son, he was upset with the possibility of having to pay for his learning. Additionally, in \"Quincea\u00f1era,\" he is reduced to tears when Alex offers to tell him how much her Quincea\u00f1era cost.\n\nJerry is proud of his magical ancestry and teaches his children about the proper uses of magic in \"Wizard Training Class\" on Tuesdays and Thursdays, in the lair magically disguised as a food locker in the restaurant. However, his children often disobey his magic rules (Alex, most often being the case), and he has to punish them. He wants his kids to be great wizards, but also wants them to be able to live a life without using their powers since they may not have them in the future, as only one of them will get to keep his/her powers as an adult. Jerry has an younger brother named Kelbo ([[Jeff Garlin]]), who is seen in the season one episode \"''Alex in the Middle''\", who is the wizard in Jerry's family because Jerry had to give him the powers to marry Theresa. Jerry's children consider Kelbo to be more fun than Jerry, and Alex even decides to have Kelbo be her magic teacher, and is revealed to be irresponsible with magic (almost as much as Alex is sometimes) as is shown when Kelbo fails to stop a package of sea chimps that spouts a huge gush of water eventually flooding the wizard lair and turning Kelbo and Alex into sea chimps. Jerry ends up being the one who saves them both, and he reveals a secret that he has kept from Alex, Max and Justin: that he gave up his powers in order to marry Theresa, due to a rule forbidding wizards and mortals from marrying, thus relinquishing his powers to Kelbo in order to marry her. In \"''Retest''\" it is revealed that Jerry and Kelbo have a sister, Megan. Megan holds a grudge against Jerry for giving Kelbo his powers instead of her. She lives in an art studio in Paris where she paints pictures. She is similar to Alex because she, like Alex, loves Art and hates hard work, though, unlike Alex, she is unwilling or unable to apologize for her actions. It is most likely their parents are still alive because of references from Alex and Max. Such as in \"Future Harper\", when Alex is telling Harper about a wizard adventure about her and her brothers, Harper already knows the ending and tells Alex she already told her the story. Alex replies \"Oh my gosh I'm starting to sound like Grandma\".\n\nJerry also is a fan of the [[New York Mets]] and [[New York Jets]], he and Theresa accidentally made fools of themselves in front of Max's date's parents, because Max got confused between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera|New York Metropolitan Opera (The Met)]] while trying to find common interest between them and his date's parents, not realizing that they keep forgetting about the [[Intermission]] they usually believed the stories to \"end abruptly in the middle\". In several episodes of the series (more so in season one, than in other seasons), Jerry often makes a remark that accidentally insults Theresa, and quickly tries to correct his statement. Such an example is in season one's \"''Movies''\", in which Theresa tells Alex that no matter how old she gets that she is not too old to spend time with her family, Jerry responds \"Exactly, just look at your mother\". Alex then points out that Jerry accidentally called Theresa \"old\", and he attempts and fails to change the subject.\n\nIn ''Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie'', Jerry gives Justin the family wand and the spell book which Alex steals accidentally wishing her parents never met or fell in love, but it was resolved \u2013 ironically by Alex herself, the reckless one out of his three children, who also surprisingly won the Premature Family Wizard competition against Justin, as Justin was the favorite out of the three to win it but lost to Alex, who then gives up her powers so they could compete for their powers when they are old enough.\n\nJerry has made more than one mention of past friends of his youth, including \"[[Ponyboy Curtis|Ponyboy]]\" and [[John Bender (character)|John Bender]]; both names of rebellious teen characters in classic 80's pop-culture films, [[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]] and [[The Breakfast Club]], respectively. Aside from the names, no other specific connections or further implications seem to have been made connecting Jerry's youth and the events in these stories. It is revealed in \"Wizard for a Day\", that he does not need his magic powers anymore, because when Alex gave him [[Merlin]]'s hat for his birthday, granting the wearer magic powers for 24 hours, all he wished for was a sandwich, whereas he could've just as easily went downstairs to make a sandwich himself in the Sub Station. Feeling underwhelmed, Alex used the hat to convert the Sub Station into a milkshake bar from Jerry's youth. After seeing this, he reminisced about it for a few moments before asking Alex to change it back, though he changed his mind when he saw how many customers it attracted. He later told Alex that he doesn't need big exciting gifts, as he his satisfied enough with small and simple ones (referring to Justin's gift, a magic pencil sharpener made from a soup-can).\n\n==Recurring characters==\nThe following is a list of recurring characters in the Disney Channel sitcom ''Wizards of Waverly Place''.\n\n===Zeke Beakerman===\n'''Ezekiel 'Zeke' Beakerman'''<ref>\"Smarty Pants\", season 2, episode 1 has Zeke in the credits; in \"Movies\", season 1, episode 9 he is called \"Zack\".</ref> (Dan Benson) is Justin's best friend. Zeke is in the same grade as Justin. He attends Tribeca Prep and is in advanced chemistry along with Justin. He is also part of an Alien Language League; he and Justin often \"speak alien\" to each other. Zeke's first appearance was in \"Movies\", but strangely he was known as Zack Rosenblack. They later changed his name to Zeke. He is very impulsive and easygoing. He and Justin are also on the same Quiz Bowl team in \"Smarty Pants\". Zeke and Justin have tried out for several sports teams, but have apparently failed at all of them. In \"Fashion Week\", they somehow succeed at talking to models. Zeke got the role of Peter Pan in the school play in \"Fairy Tale\". In the episode \"Wizard For a Day\", he is upset when the real aliens do not understand his \"alien speak\". Zeke and Harper go to \"Zombie Prom\" together. He is also on the [[cheerleader|cheer squad]], as revealed in \"Positive Alex\". He runs against Justin in the campaign for student body president in \"Detention Election\", but later he votes for Justin. He continues to assist Justin as student body president. Zeke continues his relationship with Harper in \"Alex Russo, Matchmaker?\" In \"Wizards Unleashed\", Zeke and Harper take care of the sub station and share their first kiss. In \"Alex Russo, Matchmaker\", Zeke is revealed to have hydrophobia and in season 4 he finds out the Russos are wizards. He assists the Russos when possible, though his assistance usually turns more troublesome than helpful. He is present during the Russo siblings' competition and ceremony at the series finale.\n\n===Mr. Laritate===\n'''Mr. Herschel Laritate''' ([[Bill Chott]]) is the principal of Tribeca Prep High School, which is mentioned when he calls Alex Russo into the principal's office in \"Alex Does Good\". Humorously, it is shown in the same episode that Alex has been sent to the principal's office way too often (implying Alex is a delinquent student) to the point that the two have somewhat of regular routines down, such as serving drink and snacks to each other and complementing the office's new mural of horses. His last name, Laritate, is a pun of Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. He loves anything related to the [[Old West]], as seen in his daily life, such as wears cowboy hat and [[bolo tie]], uses terms from that era when speaking, and even decorates his office in that theme. When he was relieved from his position as principal in \"Western Show\", he choose to work as part-time employee in 'Wild Billy's Western Roundup'. He teaches History class, Marriage and Family class, and taught the Art class once as temporary teacher. Mr. Laritate also acts as the adviser of several activities at the school including the World School Summit at the U.N., Happy Helpers Club, Quiz Bowl, sport activities, and school plays. His alma mater is Clementine College as mentioned in \"Fairy Tale\", but later on he confessed that he does not have a college degree in \"Franken-Girl\". Nevertheless, he claimed to be able to provide a strong recommendation letter for Justin Russo to the said college.\n\nMr. Laritate considers Justin as a model student. On the contrary, he has an on-and-off relationship with Justin's sister, Alex, in that he is often disappointed in Alex's lack of work ethic and unwillingness to do well in school. In season two's \"Don't Rain on Justin's Parade\", Mr. Laritate calls Alex an evil genius, much to Alex's pleasure. However, it is evident that he cares about her through his many efforts to reach out to her. In \"Alex's Logo\", he is basically Alex's only friend because everybody became mad at Alex after she said what she really thought of them while giving a speech under truth spell. After Alex complains about everybody still being mad at her, even though it has been a week since the speech, Mr. Laritate then tries to help Alex by doing more embarrassing acts in the hope that everybody will turn their attention to him and forget what Alex has done. Unfortunately, he also incidentally embarrasses Alex on the microphone while doing so, resulting other students calling her the principal's BFF (Best Friend Forever). He gives all the students that then threw T-shirts at him detention. He also gave Alex, who did not throw a T-shirt, detention, in order to justify his \"student to principal\" relationship. However, she smiles at Mr. Laritate's and says \"thank you\", because she knows its just his another attempt to defuse tension between her and other students. It was also revealed in this episode that Mr. Laritate has somewhat a difficult relationship with his mother.\n\nIn season 4, Alex crashes Mr. Laritate's car during her driving lesson and he sees how grown up she has become when she confesses the truth to him. Mr. Laritate personally hands high school diploma to Alex and Harper Finkle during a makeshift graduation ceremony of Tribeca Prep class of 2011 in \"Wizards vs Asteroids\". He appeared last time in \"Get along Little Zombie\" in which he was temporarily turned into a zombie after he got bitten by one during his visit to Alex and Harper's apartment. Alex and Mason Greyback turned him back into human again using 'Zombie bites treatment' lotion. It is shown at the end of the episode that he is, apparently, willing to keep a close relationship to the Russo family.\n\n===Mason Greyback===\n'''Mason Greyback''' ([[Gregg Sulkin]]; seasons 3-4) is first mentioned in Season 2 episode ''Future Harper'' when Future Harper tells Alex that she seems irritable and asks if she broke up with Mason yet, implying that she will date a boy named Mason in the future.\n\nMason is first fully introduced as a student in Alex's art class, and as an English boy who has a crush on Alex. They later begin to date. Mason loves to paint. He gives Alex a necklace that lights up when the person who wears it is in love with the person who put it on them. It is revealed that he in fact is a [[werewolf]] but doesn't turn Alex into a werewolf when they kiss, because he is a purebred and only mutts turn people into werewolves when they kiss, referencing Justin's werewolf Wizface-date from the season 2 episode \"Beware Wolf\". He helps in the search for Juliet after picking up her scent from her dental floss. It is revealed that he and Juliet used to date (which also reveals Mason doesn't age) and he admits impulsively that he never stopped loving her, which breaks Alex's heart. She throws away the magic necklace he gave her (which lights up if the wearer is in love with the person who put it on them). He later tells Max that, like dogs, werewolves are incredibly loyal and impulsive, which explains why he couldn't contain himself when he saw Juliet, though his feelings for Alex are still present. He tries to prove his love for Alex by going back to the mummy's tomb to find the necklace. Justin, Max, and Juliet come to rescue Alex, even though Alex volunteered to go and wasn't in any real danger. Max likes Mason, but Justin hates him for breaking Alex's heart. When Justin tries to make Alex forcedly leave the tomb, Mason, being fiercely protective, turns into a werewolf, and starts fighting Justin and Juliet. He is attacking Justin when Juliet bites him, causing him to turn into a wolf permanently. Before his transformation, Alex puts the necklace on him and it lights up. Alex knows now that he truly loves her, but he leaves because as a wolf, he has no control. He leaves the mummy's tomb as he transforms into a wolf.\n\nIn ''Wizards Unleashed'', it is discovered that Mason has been captured by wizards and is being used in TV advertisements. Upon discovering this, Alex manages to retrieve him, and uses magic to revert the transformation, but only succeeds in leaving him with pointy ears, claws, and mass abounds of fur. Though Alex initially has trouble accepting Mason in this new state, she eventually gets over it and Justin manages to fully restore his humanity by playing a magical jawharp at the end of the episode. In \"Wizards Exposed,\" the wizards get caught, and Mason gets caught while he was \"admiring his hat.\"\n\nIn \"Alex Gives Up,\" they are forced to break up due to a rule that says that werewolves and non-wizards cannot date because the werewolf always ends up eating the human due to their anger management issues. At first, Chancellor Rootie Tootie Tootie appealed the rule, but then Alex, jealous of Lisa Cucuy, who was hitting on Mason, and makes Mason extremely angry by embarrassing him in front of her brother, her parents, and the Cucuy's. Mason then transforms into his half-werewolf form and Chancellor Tootie Tootie, seeing he is incapable of controlling his anger, takes back his appeal, therefore forcing Alex and Mason to break up. In \"Journey to the Center of Mason\", Mason eats Dean Moriarty (Alex's ex-boyfriend; they broke up when Dean had to move to Ohio) because he is jealous that Alex is spending time with Dean and not him. Alex, Justin, and Max go inside of Mason. While in Mason, Alex, Justin, and Max go into his brain. Alex sees that all Mason does is think about her. When Alex, Justin, and Max come out of him with Dean, Dean leaves because Alex doesn't want him back. After he leaves, Alex and Mason get back together because Alex decided to rejoin the Wizard Competition so she and Mason could be together. In the episode, Dean only refers to Mason as \"London Bridges\". Mason has the deepest love for Alex and has nicknamed her 'Brown Eyes', 'Little Meatball', and 'Love'. In \"Wizard of the Year\", Alex breaks up with him for the third time because of his mistrust of her and a monster tamer named Chase.\n\nIn the episodes of \"Wizards of Apartment 13B\", Alex and Harper move into an apartment on the thirteenth floor where coincidentally Mason is living at. Mason stops at nothing to win Alex back; using Harper's training wand to open Alex's heart to him. Though this turns out for the worse as Alex begins to flirt with an ugly ogre and Felix. In \"Ghost Roommate\", Mason goes on a date with Lucy, a ghost who is living with Alex and Harper. Alex is jealous that Mason and Lucy went on a date and proceed to find Lucy's long lost true love. Alex is then stuck on the Bermuda Triangle, where magic can't be used. Mason comes to her rescue using Justin's hideous Bermuda shorts. In \"Get Along, Little Zombie\", Mason is still determined to ask Alex out on a date and even breaking the elevator to spend some time with Alex; exposing the magical thirteenth floor to non-magical residents. Soon, Mr. Laritate discovers the thirteenth floor and gets bitten by a zombie; subsequently gets turned into a zombie. Mason and Alex go on a wild goose chase trying to find Mr. Laritate and end up in a square dance. Alex then realizes that she wants Mason back while Mason was trying to say that maybe he and Alex should just be friends. At the end of the episode, it is shown that Mason and Alex do get back together. In \"Who Will be the Family Wizard\", Mason comes to the wizard competition to cheer on Alex. He and Juliet meet once again and tell each other no hard feelings from the events that took place in \"Wizards vs. Werewolves\". Also when Alex loses the competition, he and Alex look deeply saddened due to her losing and ponder breaking up. However, Justin realizes how much Alex needs to win to be happy, and so reveals she would have won if she hadn't gone back for him and he didn't really win like everyone thought he did. Alex becomes the Russo family wizard and is able to stay with Mason. In \"The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex\", Mason gets jealous over the evil wizard, Dominic, who flirts with Alex. Mason breaks Alex out of jail before she can be exiled, and he throws Dominic off the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n\n===Juliet van Heusen===\n'''Juliet van Heusen''' ([[Bridgit Mendler]]; seasons 2-4) is a teenage [[vampire]] who is Justin Russo's main love interest. When she was born, her parents let her have a soul so she could socialize in the human world. This also makes her more compassionate than most vampires, who are usually heartless and cunning. She is characterized as a beautiful girl with blonde hair and rather pale skin. She wears vanilla-scented perfume to hide her true vampire scent of death and decay in an attempt to avoid detection by monster hunters. She is also a health-conscious girl who has certain diet on her menu. Juliet's development as a vampire is very slow, as her fangs have just started to grow at a late age for a vampire. She is also shown to not want to drink blood, and even tries to persuade her parents to abstain from drinking blood. As a very unusual character for a vampire, this trait is used for comic effect, especially when she empties a berliner with her fangs.\n\nAt first, Juliet and Justin were not allowed to date by their respective parents due to their restaurants' rivalry. However, the two fight for their love and soon are allowed to date. In \"Night at the Lazerama\", Juliet accompanies Justin on his monster-hunt for a [[mummy]]. Unfortunately, they become trapped in a glass display near a [[skylight|glass roof]], which would cause Juliet to burn up in the morning. Since the mummy is the only one that is able to take Juliet out from the glass display, Justin decides that the only way to save Juliet's life is to turn her into the mummy's slave. Nevertheless, he promises to save her one day. The mummy then takes Juliet to [[Transylvania]], where she is forcibly imprisoned in [[suspended animation]] behind [[Hieroglyphics]], though she never gives up hope that Justin will save her. In \"Wizards vs. Werewolves\", Justin indeed saves her, and then it is revealed that she once dated Mason Greyback, Alex's [[werewolf]] boyfriend, 300 years ago. This fact makes Justin rather jealous towards Mason, leads to a fight between the two. Juliet intervenes when Justin and Mason fight, and Mason scratches Juliet and, in turn, Juliet bites Mason, resulting in Mason turning into a wolf and Juliet is stripped of her vampire powers. This causes her to rapidly age into an old woman, since she is truly 2,193 years old. Because of this, Justin and Juliet are forced to end their relationship, both of them heartbroken.\n\nIn \"Moving On\", Juliet appears again, happy to witness that Justin apparently has forgotten her and moved on. However, Justin and Juliet reunite towards the end of season 4, since, actually, none of them has stopped loving each other. Juliet gets her vampire powers and youth back when Gorog (the leader of dark angels) gives them to her in an effort to tempt Justin to join the Dark Side. However, the Russos defeat Gorog, releasing Juliet from his influence. Juliet comes to support Justin at the Russo family's wizard competition, where she and Mason meet and both acknowledge that no hard feelings left from the events that took place in \"Wizards vs. Werewolves\". When Justin takes Professor Crumbs' place as headmaster of WizTech, Juliet says she's even happier about that.\n\n===Dean Moriarty===\n'''Dean Moriarty''' ([[Daniel Samonas]]; seasons 2 and 4) is Alex's boyfriend in the second season. He makes temporary tattoos in the boys bathroom and is interested in cars. In episode \"Racing\" he charmed Alex's parents with his car skills, though he revealed to Alex that he only did it to make a good first impression by being polite. It is also revealed in that episode, that he was raised by his Uncle, as he exclaimed proudly \"my Uncle raised me with manners\". Harper and Justin aren't too fond of him and Jerry seems the same way later on, though this is partly due to Jerry being an overprotective father after learning that he is dating Alex. He can never remember Harper's name. In the episode \"Alex's Brother Maximan\" it was shown he likes roller skating and playing with the claw game and winning stuffed animals. The only thing Alex doesn't like about him is that he's horrible at showing his feelings, as shown in \"Saving Wiz Tech Part 1\", but it changed in \"Saving Wiz Tech Part 2\". He does not appear to be academically inclined, as Alex noticed a false good grade on his wooden assignment/gift for her (it was a D changed to a B), and he also stated that he does not \"test well\", meaning he doesn't see himself as book-smart. He moved away sometime after that, so Alex visited him in his dreams in \"Wizards vs Vampires: Dream Date\"; she then saw how they were growing apart, so they broke up. But he returned in Season 4 \"Journey to the Center of Mason\" because he wanted to get back together, though she denied it because she likes Mason, and Mason eats him out of jealousy. Dean is later rescued by Alex, Justin, and Max, and learns that Alex has chosen Mason and agrees to back off.\n\n===Professor Crumbs===\n'''Professor Crumbs''' ([[Ian Abercrombie]]) is the headmaster of WizTech (a reference to [[Albus Dumbledore]]). In \"Wizard School\", he is often seen holding a muffin. (The muffin's crumbs fall into his beard, hence the name \"Crumbs\".) Professor Crumbs is never seen without his incredibly long beard, even when he was turned into a guinea pig in the episode \"Report Card\". The only episode where he has been seen without his beard is in part two of season two's \"Saving WizTech\" when Ronald Longcape, Jr. (Chad Duell) took the beard from him, revealing that it was a fake beard all this time. After he was defeated, Crumbs took his beard back. Crumbs is shown how to socialize by Max in \"Saving WizTech\" and has done some childish things, such as spitting over the edge of the Tower of Evil. In season two's \"Saving WizTech\", he states that he is 850 years old. He speaks with a British accent, which Alex sometimes makes fun of. Another thing that Alex makes fun of is the fact that he has a smelly beard revealed in ''Wizards Exposed''. In the season 3 finale, he appears to be captured by a government agency with the rest of the wizard elite. However, the season 4 premiere reveals it was all an illusion Crumbs created to \"test\" Justin and Alex. As each broke it by revealing to government agents and reporters (all also illusions), Crumbs forces them both to start at level 1 of their wizard lessons; however, after seeing how remarkably unintelligent Max was, he regretted his choice. When Justin and Max change him back into a kid, in their attempt to trick him into revealing how to undo a mutant spell they cast on Max that turned him into a little girl, it's revealed that everyone in Crumbs' family has a beard even as a kid. In the four-part episode revolving around Floor 13B, Professor Crumbs was surprised about a wizard floor that he did not know of and ended up discovering that Gorog was behind it. Professor Crumbs was captured by Gorog alongside the other inhabitants and was later rescued by the Russos upon Gorog's defeat. In the end of the series finale, Crumbs announces Alex as the Family Wizard and that he is retiring, and makes Justin Russo ([[David Henrie]]) the new headmaster of WizTech, thus also granting Justin his full magic powers.\n\n===Hugh Normous===\n'''Hugh Normous''' ([[Josh Sussman]]; seasons 1-2 and 4) was Alex's Wiz Tech friend he first appeared in \"Wizard School.\" His name is a pun of the word \"enormous\", it is also an irony considering that he isn't a real giant, as pointed out by Alex when he introduced himself and she responded with \"Not Really\". At first, he believed himself to be a giant, since his parents are giants, but that he's the runt of the litter, so he carries around miniature everyday objects to boost his self-esteem; humorously, he also wears underpants and glasses too small for himself. He later appeared in season 2 episode ''Saving Wiz Tech'' where he showed Alex his friend Ronald Longcape Jr he later appears in ''Harper Knows'' and ''Hugh's not Normous'' where he discovers that he is adopted and that he is not a real giant. He eventually meets his birth parents and goes to live with them, but he doesn't resent his adoptive parents. Hugh is a giant in the sense of, when he met his birth parents, he was markedly taller than both of them, with both of them commenting on his larger size. Presumably, after discovering this, he stopped his habit of carrying miniature objects and started wearing regular-sized clothes. He does not appear in season 3 or the movie. He returned in ''Ghost Roommate'', still thinking he is a giant.\n\n===Kelbo Russo===\n'''Kelbo Russo''' ([[Jeff Garlin]]; seasons 1-3) is the uncle of Alex, Justin and Max, brother of Jerry and Megan and brother-in-law of Theresa. Unlike Jerry, he is very fun and carefree. Kelbo is a full wizard (Jerry had originally won the competition, but gave up his powers to marry a mortal) who often uses his powers very childishly, and often seems just as irresponsible with them as Alex is with her own. As a recurring gag, in every episode he appears in during the post credits scenes, he makes a prank call to someone.\n\nHe first appears in \"Alex In the Middle\", and temporarily becomes Alex's wizard tutor. He reappears in \"Retest\", it is requested that he, Jerry and their sister Megan re-do their wizard competition, but when Megan refuses, Kelbo hires a magical fish-lawyer to help them, but after he informs that there is nothing that he can do, Kelbo decides to move to Atlantis for good. He appears once again in \"Dude Looks Like Shakira\", and reveals that he is [[Shakira]], but also added that what he has been doing is against the wizard rules, and can no longer control his transformations. The Russos eventually cure him of his illness (though Shakira's career-end isn't mentioned afterwards). Despite his immaturity, naivety and clueless behavior, Kelbo proves to be a very loving and caring uncle, which was visible in his second appearing, and he, unlike Jerry, has no hard feelings for Megan, in fact, he was genuinely happy to see her again. Also in \"Dude Looks Like Shakira\", Kelbo, in a rare moment of maturity, attempts to confess his crime to the wizard council, even knowing the consequences, in order to free his family from legal issues. Prank calls include: Is your refrigerator running (to Theresa in \"Alex in the Middle\"), Is your refrigerator running (to Megan in \"Retest\"), This is the wizards council. We'll be over to break you hands for breaking wizard rules, etc. (to Justin in \"Dude looks like Shakira\"). It's also shown that he really hates the taste of cinnamon. He did not appear in season 4.\n\n===Monotone Woman===\n'''Monotone Woman''' ([[Amanda Tepe]]; seasons 1-2) has played numerous characters during the show's first season, as well as one guest appearance in season two.

Jobs she has held include department store manager, waitress, frozen yogurt store manager, hotel maitre'd, dog show security guard, the information desk lady at Volcano Land (only job in the magic world), art museum security guard, and hot dog vendor. Tepe's only appearance on the show during the second season is in the episode \"Wizards vs. Vampires: Dream Date\" as the hot dog vendor person. Her name in \"New Employee\" is Amanda, according to her name tag, but in \"Art Museum Piece\", her name is Elaine according to Blue Boy.

Harper was first to find out, but Stevie makes Harper forget in the episode ''Third Wheel'' (not knowing that Harper already knows about magic). Then Alex then uses the jog your memory spell on Harper (seeing that Harper is trying to tell her something important) and she finds out, which brings Stevie and Alex's friendship closer. It is revealed in \"The Good the Bad and the Alex\" that Stevie was forming a wizard revolution that prevents the other siblings of a wizard competition from losing their powers. She recruits Alex and Max, to the dismay of Harper, Justin, and Stevie's brother, Warren. As Max takes a picture of Alex and Stevie, Alex freezes Stevie, enabling Warren to get his full powers.

Justin has an obvious crush on her, as he barely notices the rest of the class. She later reveals to Alex that she really likes Justin, so Alex puts the copycat spell on Rosie so she'll do everything Alex does. Her wizard robe comes off, revealing her wings, and everyone realizes she is an angel. In the second part, Rosie and Justin have their first date, but Jerry, Theresa, Alex, Harper and Max ruin it, so Rosie takes Justin, Alex and Harper to an angel [[Nightclub|dance club]], for a second chance at their first date. During the angel slide, the club manager, Zeedrik, realizes that Alex and Harper aren't real angels. The foursome flee the club after Justin, Alex and Harper (barely) convince everyone they're real angels. At the end, Rosie's wings turn black, revealing that she is an angel of darkness. <br>In the third part, Justin starts doing bad stuff, because Rosie, who's a dark angel, is influencing him without anyone (except for her) realizing it. Alex gets worried, so she goes to the guardian angel headquarters. There she meets Tina ([[China Anne McClain]]), a guardian angel in training, who desperately wants her wings, so she is always trying to help Alex. Alex gets a guardian angel for Justin, and goes back to Waverly Place with Tina. Tina recognizes Rosie, and reveals that she used to be her guardian angel teacher, but is now an angel of darkness. Alex tells Justin this, and Rosie admits it, but also says that she still cares about him and hopes he'll still care about her. Justin decides to stay with Rosie, infuriating Alex. Alex and Tina find Justin's guardian angel, Monti, tied up by Rosie, and they find her to-do-list. The list reveals that she is using Justin to steal the moral [[compass]], which controls the morality of the world, from the guardian angels for the angels of darkness. Justin successfully steals the compass and Gorog (the leader of dark angels) rewards Justin with dark angel wings. The dark angels use the moral compass to turn everyone good to evil (with the exception of angels). Rosie realizes that Gorog plans on destroying Justin and tries to warn him, but he refuses to listen. Rosie realizes how much she really loves Justin, and goes to the Russos house to convince Alex to save her brother. Her sheer honesty convinces Alex to agree, and Alex and Tina go to the dark world, trying to get the moral compass back. However, Justin tries to prove his loyalty to Gorog by fighting Alex and Tina. Rosie professes her love to Justin, and with that love persuades Justin to fight evil and return to good. They escape, along with Alex and Tina, and they return the compass to the guardian angels. <br>Rosie's good deed and love for Justin make her a guardian angel again. They both want to continue dating, but Justin decides against it because the world needs as many guardian angels as possible, so they go their separate ways. In the end, Rosie promotes Tina to full guardian angel. Also, Rosie tells Justin to do some bad things sometimes so that she can visit him in the future, but it has never been revealed whether she has visited him.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Gorog}}''' ([[John Rubinstein]]; season 4) was an Angel of Darkness.

Alex managed to rescue Justin and they got away from Gorog. <br>In \"Wizards of 13B,\" Gorog set up a secret Wizard Floor in an apartment building while disguised as the floor's manager '''Dexter''' ([[Fred Stoller]]). In \"Wizards vs. Everything,\" Gorog's ruse was revealed when Professor Crumbs investigated the Wizard Floor that he never knew existed. Gorog revealed that he was plotting to gather inhabitants of Floor 13 in order to rebuild his army. Under the control of Gorog, Felix used a spell that made the whole floor go with them to the basement, where they will dig a hole into the Wizard World. Gorog and his brainwashed servants left the floor while Alex, Harper, and Justin were left trapped in the floor. Gorog takes the kidnapped wizards to his evil lair, where he plans to make them evil. He tricks Hugh Normous into becoming one of the evil wizards in his army. Professor Crumbs fakes becoming evil when Gorog plans on making him evil. Gorog then makes the wizard army dig a hole to the atmosphere to the wizard world, so they can take over it. Gorog also tries to trick Mason into being one of the members in his army, but Mason refuses. Gorog tricks him into joining however. Gorog then makes Felix send a black hole to suck Alex and Justin in it. Gorog gives the kidnapped wizards their wands so they can take over the wizard world, but Crumbs refuses to let them. On Gorog's order, Felix then gets rid of Crumbs. When Alex, Justin, and Max arrive at Gorog's lair and attempt to destroy him, Mason tries to convince Alex to join them. Gorog also reveals Justin's ex-girlfriend Juliet (who is young again thanks to Gorog restoring her powers) and she convinces Justin to join. Alex also surrenders and Max is forced to as well. The three then use their magics to get rid of Gorog freeing those Gorog has brainwashed. In \"The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex\", Dominic reveals to Alex that Gorog is his uncle.

Dominic gives Alex a friendship bracelet, which is later revealed to be an enchanted bracelet which is used to hold Max, Theresa, Jerry, Harper, and Mason captive. When Alex divides herself into a Good Alex and Evil Alex, Dominic joins forces with Evil Alex to take over the world. After Alex destroys the Evil Alex (so she thinks), Dominic tries to flirt with Alex one last time in order to get her to join forces with him. Mason is furious and pushes Dominic over the Leaning Tower of Pisa, sending him to his death. Dominic reveals to Alex that he is the nephew of her former enemy, the Angel of Darkness, Gorog, because of this, he may not be a full wizard and may be an angel of darkness himself, or Gorog may have had a wizard brother or sister.\n* '''Carmela''' ([[Natalia Nogulich]]) - Carmela is an Italian cousin of Jerry Russo, and was a wizard in training with him. Carmela is the mother of two wizard in training kids, Bianca and Gino. A running gag throughout the film is that Carmela tickles Jerry every time she wants him to do something.

Carmela and the other Russo's are big fans of Jerry's daughter Alex, the family wizard and most powerful wizard of her generation. Carmela has the Russo's over for a family reunion so the family can catch up.\n* '''Francesca''' (Antonella Lentini) - Francesca is an Italian cousin of the Russo family. When Max first sees her, he tries to pursue her, but when he tries to kiss her, she smacks him. Francesca tries to tell Max that they're cousins, but since she only speaks Italian, he doesn't understand her. At the end of the film, Max tells Francesca that he hopes to see her again and hopes she'll wait for him to return, Francesca tries to tell him that they're cousins and he's stupid, but Max just thinks he's wearing her down.\n\n==Guest characters==\n* [[Heidi Swedberg]] as Miss Majorheely (\"Art Teacher\") 2.15 (2009)\n* [[Austin Butler]] as George (\"Positive Alex\") 3.10 (2010)\n* [[Cindy Crawford]] as Bebe Rockford (\"Fashion Week\") 2.13 (2009)\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Future Harper/\"H.J.
