It is within the nine-county [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The population at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] was 35,432. Oakley was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1999, making it the newest incorporated city in Contra Costa County. Oakley is part of the East Contra Costa Bicycle Plan, which has existing facilities in Oakley as well as plans for further expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/depart/cd/transportation/committee/transplan/bike/fin/fig1.pdf|title=East Contra Costa County Bicycle Facilitees|author=|date=|website=contra-costa.ca.us|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"oak\" comes from the abundance of [[oak|oak trees]], while the suffix \"-ley\" comes from the Old English word for \"field\" or \"meadow\".<ref>Gudde, Erwin G. \"California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographic Names\", 4th ed, University of California Press, p. 266</ref>\n\n==Geography and environment==\nThe Oakley areas offers access to the Delta de Anza Regional Trail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=10616|title=ePodunk|author=|date=|website=www.epodunk.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>  According to reports provided by CNN,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/|title=MONEY: Personal Finance News & Advice|author=|date=|website=MONEY.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> Oakley experiences 21.16&nbsp;inches of annual rainfall with an average high temperature in July of 96.0 F and an average low temperature in January of 40.0 F.  Oakley experiences 52% clear days throughout the year.\n\nOakley's west border is Highway 160, which provides access to Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, and the Central Valley. The City of [[Antioch, California|Antioch]] adjoins Oakley on the west, the city of [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]] adjoins Oakley on the south, and [[Bethel Island]] lies to the east. The [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]] forms the northern boundary.  The southwestern skyline is dominated by [[Mt. Diablo]].\n\n==Boundaries==\n\nPrior to 1963, creating a new city in California only required a petition, a public hearing (where 51 percent of the landowners could approve the desire to incorporate) and an election. During the 1950s over 50 new cities incorporated, and in Los Angeles County alone, 10 new cities incorporated in 1957. At the time, no thought was given as to how or who would pay the costs for the necessary services needed to sustain a city. Fire, police, water and sanitation services were often provided by a number of different and overlapping entities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn an effort to gain control over this kluge of overlapping services and control the proliferation of incorporations, Governor Edmund G Brown, Sr. created the Commission on Metropolitan Area Problems, in 1959. The Commission was given the task of studying and making recommendations on the \"misuse of land resources\" and the growing complexity of overlapping local government jurisdictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe Knox-Nisbit Act of 1963 contained the Commission's recommendations on local government reorganization resulting in the creation of the Local Agency Formation Commission or LAFCO, operating in every county. Additional powers were given to LAFCO in the District Reorganization Act of 1965, the Municipal Organization Act of 1977, the Cortese-Knox Local Government Reorganization Act 1985 and the Cortese-Knox-Hertz Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calafco.org/lafco-law/faq/what-lafcos-history|title=What is LAFCo's history?|last=|first=|date=|website=calafco.org|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOne of the services mandated to LAFCO was to create a Municipal Service Reviews (MSRs) of all local agencies. An MSR is a comprehensive study designed to better inform LAFCO, local agencies, and the community about the provision of municipal services. Service reviews capture and analyze information about the governance structures and efficiencies of service providers and identify opportunities for greater coordination and cooperation between providers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe last MSR for Oakley was created in 2008 and can be found [http://www.contracostalafco.org/municipal_service_reviews/east_contra_costa_county_sub-regional/05%20-%20Oakley%20Final%20Adopted.pdf here].<ref>[http://www.contracostalafco.org/municipal_service_reviews/east_contra_costa_county_sub-regional/05%20-%20Oakley%20Final%20Adopted.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Government==\nThe City of Oakley is a [[General-law municipality|General-Law City]], as opposed to a [[Charter city|Charter City]], formed under state legislative statutes and governed by a body of laws in the state Constitution. Oakley operates under a council-manager form of government. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Oakley City Council consists of five non-partisan council members elected \"at large\" for staggered four-year terms. Oakley's City Council are considered part-time because, aside from being council members, they have full-time jobs. This part-time nature of the council opens up opportunities for ordinary citizens who are working in the private sector to participate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAnnually, at the first council meeting in December, the Mayor is selected by a majority of the City Council from among currently serving Council Members. At this time a Vice Mayor is also selected. This is the standard method among general-law cities. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a7 36801: \"The city council shall . . . choose one of its number as mayor, and one of its number as mayor pro tempore.\" However, a general-law city is permitted to have a mayor that is directly elected by the voters, if certain procedures are followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOakley's mayor presides at council meetings, appoints council members to various internal and external committees, attends community events as the council's representative, and performs other ministerial duties. The Vice Mayor presides in the Mayor's absence. The California Constitution establishes that every council member, including the Mayor has only one vote. Even a directly elected Mayor can only have one vote.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Politics===\nIn 2017, Oakley had 19,906 registered voters with 9,921 (49.8%) registered as Democrats, 4,705 (23.6%) registered as Republicans, and 4,371 (22%) [[Decline to State|decline to state]] voters.<ref>http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2017/politicalsub.pdf</ref> Records show that 662 Oakley voters are registered Independents, with an additional 55 registered Green Party members.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Elections Data |url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2017/politicalsub.pdf |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n'''Native Americans Society'''\n\nArcheologists have found prehistoric sites in the Oakley area. One substantial shell mound was discovered early in the 20th century near what is now the east edge of town. The Northwest Information Center of the California Historical Resources Information System now keeps track of archeological investigations undertaken in Oakley. Around three-dozen such projects have been completed in the past 25 years, yielding only four prehistoric sites in the city. However, the information center believes there is a high possibility that other prehistoric sites remain within the city.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe first accounts of identifiable cultural community in the west delta are attributed to the [[Bay Miwok]]s, who occupied the region between 1100 and 1770 AD. The Bay [[Miwok people]], usually called the Julpunes or Pulpunes by European explorers, were organized into \"[[tribelet]]s\"\u2014political units that included several fairly permanent villages and a set of seasonal campsites arrayed across a well-defined territory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''Spanish Exploration'''<br>\nSpanish incursions into the Oakley area began in the 1770s. The first to enter what are now the city limits was the De Anza expedition of 1775\u201376. However, after a failed attempt to find a route through the tule swamps to the Sierra, the De Anza expedition returned to Monterey. Subsequent expeditions by the Spanish did not result in colonization. Europeans settled in the Delta in the 19th century, but were killed by malaria and smallpox.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''Contemporary History'''<br>\nThe name Oakley is of Old English origin and its meaning is \"meadow of oak trees\". This aptly describes the area when first settled and to some extent even today. However, if not for the flip of a coin and cribbage board the community may have been named Dewey. Instead of the Oak Leaf logo it may have been a dew drop. City founder Randolph Marsh wanted to name the city Dewey, after Admiral Dewey. Mr. Marsh was impressed with the exploits of Admiral Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish\u2013American War. His friend J.T. Whightman preferred the name \"Oakley\" because the terrain was largely meadows and oaks. To determine which name would prevail they battled it out over a game of cribbage. Marsh may have lost the game and the right to name the city but he ensured his immortality by choosing downtown street names whose first initials spelled \"Marsh\" \u2014 Main, Acme, Ruby, Star and Home.<br>\nOakley's first post office was established in 1898,<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|674}}</ref> and Oakley only became an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city a full 101 years later, in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.oakley.ca.us/|title=City of Oakley - City of Oakley|author=|date=|website=City of Oakley|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\nThe city's motto is, \"A Place for Families in the Heart of the [[Sacramento \u2013 San Joaquin River Delta|Delta.]]\"\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nOakley still has vineyards; most have been here since the late 1800s. Early Portuguese and Italian immigrants found a climate reminiscent of the Mediterranean one they left behind and planted thousands of acres of vineyards. Some of the oldest, over a 100 years old and rarest grapevines in California are still producing here in Oakley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nNearly 80 percent of Oakley's roughly 700 acres of vineyards is planted in Zinfandel, a variety of red wine grape. Other varieties of grapes in Oakley include: Mourv\u00e8dre, a red grape used to make both strong, dark red wines and ros\u00e9s; Carignane, another red wine grape, is one of the world's most widely available grapes. These three varieties also make up most of Oakley's ancient vines (80 \u2013 120 years old).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThere are other grapes grown in Oakley: Palomino is a white grape; S\u00e9millon is a golden-skinned grape; other red grapes include; Grenache, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Barbera and Alicante Bouschet. Oakley's grape harvest can conservatively be estimated at about 2,000 tons. These grapes are distributed to a number of local wineries that include: Cline, Bogel, Bonnie Dunes, The Three Wine Company, Lucca Winery \u2013 Wines from the Lucchesi Family, Gallo and Rosenblum Cellars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Police services==\nHistorically, Oakley contracted for police services with the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office; however, in May 2016 the City transitioned to bring the Police Department staffing \"in-house.\" This transition was made due to rising costs of the Sheriff's Office contract. The City still contracts with the Sheriff's Office for dispatch, forensics and jail services. There are 29 full-time sworn personnel (1 Chief, 2 Lieutenants, 5 Sergeants, and 21 Patrol Officers). The City Council has approved the hiring of 4 additional sworn personnel that will come on board early in 2017.  The Department is located on the west end of City Hall at 3231 Main Street.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nTraffic enforcement is the primary responsibility of all patrol officers. With the addition of two motorcycles to the mobile fleet, there are now two officers specifically assigned to traffic enforcement. Juvenile matters are handled by a full-time School Resource officer. Oakley still relies on the sheriff's office for homicide, serious sexual assault, and narcotics investigations. Oakley's Traffic Unit handles collision investigations that result in the serious injury or death of a motorist or pedestrian.<ref name=\"ci.oakley.ca.us\">http://www.ci.oakley.ca.us/subpage.cfm?id=354240</ref>\n\nThe non-emergency dispatch number for the Police Department is 925-625-8855.\n\n==Fire services==\n\nThe East Contra Costa Fire Protection District (ECCFPD) was formed in 2002 when the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors consolidated the East Diablo Fire District, Oakley-Knightsen Fire District and Bethel Island Fire District. ECCFPD serves the cities of Brentwood and Oakley, as well as the unincorporated areas of Bethel Island, Byron, Discovery Bay, Knightsen, and Marsh Creek-Morgan Territory. Responsible for an area of some 250 square miles, the District is the second largest fire service in the County. ECCFPD was a dependent special district and was governed by the five-member county Board of Supervisors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations between the County and the cities of Oakley and Brentwood governance of the ECCFPD was turned over to a new governing board in February 2010. Under authority of State Code (California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 13837), each entity appointed the appropriate number of board members. The new Board included 9 members: 4 from Brentwood, 3 from Oakley and 2 from the County. Under this appointed structure, the City Councils or Board of Supervisors appointed directors according to each entity's proportionate share of population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn March 2018 residents of the district passed Measure A which changed the Board from 9-appointed members down to 5-elected members and set elections for November 2018.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ECCFPD is a special district that manages and governs fire services within its area. The ECCFPD is funded primarily through property taxes. Providing fire services is not a function of the city of Oakley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 1306\n|1980= 2816\n|1990= 18374\n|2000= 25619\n|2010= 35432\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=42129\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0653070|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Oakley city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Oakley had a population of 35,432.

It is within the nine-county [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The population at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] was 35,432. Oakley was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1999, making it the newest incorporated city in Contra Costa County. Oakley is part of the East Contra Costa Bicycle Plan, which has existing facilities in Oakley as well as plans for further expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/depart/cd/transportation/committee/transplan/bike/fin/fig1.pdf|title=East Contra Costa County Bicycle Facilitees|author=|date=|website=contra-costa.ca.us|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"oak\" comes from the abundance of [[oak|oak trees]], while the suffix \"-ley\" comes from the Old English word for \"field\" or \"meadow\".<ref>Gudde, Erwin G. \"California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographic Names\", 4th ed, University of California Press, p. 266</ref>\n\n==Geography and environment==\nThe Oakley areas offers access to the Delta de Anza Regional Trail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=10616|title=ePodunk|author=|date=|website=www.epodunk.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>  According to reports provided by CNN,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/|title=MONEY: Personal Finance News & Advice|author=|date=|website=MONEY.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> Oakley experiences 21.16&nbsp;inches of annual rainfall with an average high temperature in July of 96.0 F and an average low temperature in January of 40.0 F.  Oakley experiences 52% clear days throughout the year.\n\nOakley's west border is Highway 160, which provides access to Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, and the Central Valley. The City of [[Antioch, California|Antioch]] adjoins Oakley on the west, the city of [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]] adjoins Oakley on the south, and [[Bethel Island]] lies to the east. The [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]] forms the northern boundary.  The southwestern skyline is dominated by [[Mt. Diablo]].\n\n==Boundaries==\n\nPrior to 1963, creating a new city in California only required a petition, a public hearing (where 51 percent of the landowners could approve the desire to incorporate) and an election. During the 1950s over 50 new cities incorporated, and in Los Angeles County alone, 10 new cities incorporated in 1957. At the time, no thought was given as to how or who would pay the costs for the necessary services needed to sustain a city. Fire, police, water and sanitation services were often provided by a number of different and overlapping entities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn an effort to gain control over this kluge of overlapping services and control the proliferation of incorporations, Governor Edmund G Brown, Sr. created the Commission on Metropolitan Area Problems, in 1959. The Commission was given the task of studying and making recommendations on the \"misuse of land resources\" and the growing complexity of overlapping local government jurisdictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe Knox-Nisbit Act of 1963 contained the Commission's recommendations on local government reorganization resulting in the creation of the Local Agency Formation Commission or LAFCO, operating in every county. Additional powers were given to LAFCO in the District Reorganization Act of 1965, the Municipal Organization Act of 1977, the Cortese-Knox Local Government Reorganization Act 1985 and the Cortese-Knox-Hertz Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calafco.org/lafco-law/faq/what-lafcos-history|title=What is LAFCo's history?|last=|first=|date=|website=calafco.org|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOne of the services mandated to LAFCO was to create a Municipal Service Reviews (MSRs) of all local agencies. An MSR is a comprehensive study designed to better inform LAFCO, local agencies, and the community about the provision of municipal services. Service reviews capture and analyze information about the governance structures and efficiencies of service providers and identify opportunities for greater coordination and cooperation between providers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe last MSR for Oakley was created in 2008 and can be found [http://www.contracostalafco.org/municipal_service_reviews/east_contra_costa_county_sub-regional/05%20-%20Oakley%20Final%20Adopted.pdf here].<ref>[http://www.contracostalafco.org/municipal_service_reviews/east_contra_costa_county_sub-regional/05%20-%20Oakley%20Final%20Adopted.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Government==\nThe City of Oakley is a [[General-law municipality|General-Law City]], as opposed to a [[Charter city|Charter City]], formed under state legislative statutes and governed by a body of laws in the state Constitution. Oakley operates under a council-manager form of government. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Oakley City Council consists of five non-partisan council members elected \"at large\" for staggered four-year terms. Oakley's City Council are considered part-time because, aside from being council members, they have full-time jobs. This part-time nature of the council opens up opportunities for ordinary citizens who are working in the private sector to participate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAnnually, at the first council meeting in December, the Mayor is selected by a majority of the City Council from among currently serving Council Members. At this time a Vice Mayor is also selected. This is the standard method among general-law cities. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a7 36801: \"The city council shall . . . choose one of its number as mayor, and one of its number as mayor pro tempore.\" However, a general-law city is permitted to have a mayor that is directly elected by the voters, if certain procedures are followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOakley's mayor presides at council meetings, appoints council members to various internal and external committees, attends community events as the council's representative, and performs other ministerial duties. The Vice Mayor presides in the Mayor's absence. The California Constitution establishes that every council member, including the Mayor has only one vote. Even a directly elected Mayor can only have one vote.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Politics===\nIn 2017, Oakley had 19,906 registered voters with 9,921 (49.8%) registered as Democrats, 4,705 (23.6%) registered as Republicans, and 4,371 (22%) [[Decline to State|decline to state]] voters.<ref>http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2017/politicalsub.pdf</ref> Records show that 662 Oakley voters are registered Independents, with an additional 55 registered Green Party members.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Elections Data |url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2017/politicalsub.pdf |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n'''Native Americans Society'''\n\nArcheologists have found prehistoric sites in the Oakley area. One substantial shell mound was discovered early in the 20th century near what is now the east edge of town. The Northwest Information Center of the California Historical Resources Information System now keeps track of archeological investigations undertaken in Oakley. Around three-dozen such projects have been completed in the past 25 years, yielding only four prehistoric sites in the city. However, the information center believes there is a high possibility that other prehistoric sites remain within the city.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe first accounts of identifiable cultural community in the west delta are attributed to the [[Bay Miwok]]s, who occupied the region between 1100 and 1770 AD. The Bay [[Miwok people]], usually called the Julpunes or Pulpunes by European explorers, were organized into \"[[tribelet]]s\"\u2014political units that included several fairly permanent villages and a set of seasonal campsites arrayed across a well-defined territory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''Spanish Exploration'''<br>\nSpanish incursions into the Oakley area began in the 1770s. The first to enter what are now the city limits was the De Anza expedition of 1775-76. However, after a failed attempt to find a route through the tule swamps to the Sierra, the De Anza expedition returned to Monterey. Subsequent expeditions by the Spanish did not result in colonization. Europeans settled in the Delta in the 19th century, but were killed by malaria and smallpox.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''Contemporary History'''<br>\nThe name Oakley is of Old English origin and its meaning is \"meadow of oak trees\". This aptly describes the area when first settled and to some extent even today. However, if not for the flip of a coin and cribbage board the community may have been named Dewey. Instead of the Oak Leaf logo it may have been a dew drop. City founder Randolph Marsh wanted to name the city Dewey, after Admiral Dewey. Mr. Marsh was impressed with the exploits of Admiral Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish\u2013American War. His friend J.T. Whightman preferred the name \"Oakley\" because the terrain was largely meadows and oaks. To determine which name would prevail they battled it out over a game of cribbage. Marsh may have lost the game and the right to name the city but he ensured his immortality by choosing downtown street names whose first initials spelled \"Marsh\" \u2014 Main, Acme, Ruby, Star and Home.<br>\nOakley's first post office was established in 1898,<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|674}}</ref> and Oakley only became an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city a full 101 years later, in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.oakley.ca.us/|title=City of Oakley - City of Oakley|author=|date=|website=City of Oakley|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\nThe city's motto is, \"A Place for Families in the Heart of the [[Sacramento \u2013 San Joaquin River Delta|Delta.]]\"\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nOakley still has vineyards; most have been here since the late 1800s. Early Portuguese and Italian immigrants found a climate reminiscent of the Mediterranean one they left behind and planted thousands of acres of vineyards. Some of the oldest, over a 100 years old and rarest grapevines in California are still producing here in Oakley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nNearly 80 percent of Oakley's roughly 700 acres of vineyards is planted in Zinfandel, a variety of red wine grape. Other varieties of grapes in Oakley include: Mourv\u00e8dre, a red grape used to make both strong, dark red wines and ros\u00e9s; Carignane, another red wine grape, is one of the world's most widely available grapes. These three varieties also make up most of Oakley's ancient vines (80 \u2013 120 years old).{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThere are other grapes grown in Oakley: Palomino is a white grape; S\u00e9millon is a golden-skinned grape; other red grapes include; Grenache, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Barbera and Alicante Bouschet. Oakley's grape harvest can conservatively be estimated at about 2,000 tons. These grapes are distributed to a number of local wineries that include: Cline, Bogel, Bonnie Dunes, The Three Wine Company, Lucca Winery \u2013 Wines from the Lucchesi Family, Gallo and Rosenblum Cellars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Police services==\nHistorically, Oakley contracted for police services with the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office; however, in May 2016 the City transitioned to bring the Police Department staffing \"in-house.\" This transition was made due to rising costs of the Sheriff's Office contract. The City still contracts with the Sheriff's Office for dispatch, forensics and jail services. There are 29 full-time sworn personnel (1 Chief, 2 Lieutenants, 5 Sergeants, and 21 Patrol Officers). The City Council has approved the hiring of 4 additional sworn personnel that will come on board early in 2017.  The Department is located on the west end of City Hall at 3231 Main Street.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nTraffic enforcement is the primary responsibility of all patrol officers. With the addition of two motorcycles to the mobile fleet, there are now two officers specifically assigned to traffic enforcement. Juvenile matters are handled by a full-time School Resource officer. Oakley still relies on the sheriff's office for homicide, serious sexual assault, and narcotics investigations. Oakley's Traffic Unit handles collision investigations that result in the serious injury or death of a motorist or pedestrian.<ref name=\"ci.oakley.ca.us\">http://www.ci.oakley.ca.us/subpage.cfm?id=354240</ref>\n\nThe non-emergency dispatch number for the Police Department is 925-625-8855.\n\n==Fire services==\n\nThe East Contra Costa Fire Protection District (ECCFPD) was formed in 2002 when the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors consolidated the East Diablo Fire District, Oakley-Knightsen Fire District and Bethel Island Fire District. ECCFPD serves the cities of Brentwood and Oakley, as well as the unincorporated areas of Bethel Island, Byron, Discovery Bay, Knightsen, and Marsh Creek-Morgan Territory. Responsible for an area of some 250 square miles, the District is the second largest fire service in the County. ECCFPD was a dependent special district and was governed by the five-member county Board of Supervisors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations between the County and the cities of Oakley and Brentwood governance of the ECCFPD was turned over to a new governing board in February 2010. Under authority of State Code (California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 13837), each entity appointed the appropriate number of board members. The new Board included 9 members: 4 from Brentwood, 3 from Oakley and 2 from the County. Under this appointed structure, the City Councils or Board of Supervisors appointed directors according to each entity's proportionate share of population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn March 2018 residents of the district passed Measure A which changed the Board from 9-appointed members down to 5-elected members and set elections for November 2018.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ECCFPD is a special district that manages and governs fire services within its area. The ECCFPD is funded primarily through property taxes. Providing fire services is not a function of the city of Oakley.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 1306\n|1980= 2816\n|1990= 18374\n|2000= 25619\n|2010= 35432\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=42129\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0653070|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Oakley city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Oakley had a population of 35,432.

When the municipality reincorporated, residents chose to make it a city and voted for the name Oakland Park. The original boundaries went from the Atlantic Ocean, west to what is now [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|U.S. 441]], and from the north fork of Middle River north to Cypress Creek Boulevard, but when the boundaries were reestablished, it was to approximately the west side of [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. 1]], west to Northeast 3rd Avenue and the north fork of Middle River north to what is now Prospect Road. Over time, it has expanded to its current boundaries, mainly due to acquiring a few other areas, such as recent annexations of previously unincorporated neighborhoods of Twin Lakes South and North Andrews Gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oaklandparkfl.org/citygovernment/about/history.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219074015/http://www.oaklandparkfl.org/citygovernment/about/history.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-02-19 |title=About Oakland Park: History |publisher=The City of Oakland Park |accessdate=2015-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOakland Park is located at {{coord|26|10|35|N|80|8|40|W|type:city}} (26.176362, -80.144509).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|19.3|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.8|km2|order=flip}} (8.40%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nOakland Park is bisected by the [[Florida East Coast Railway]], which runs parallel to [[Dixie Highway]] through the city's downtown.

When the municipality reincorporated, residents chose to make it a city and voted for the name Oakland Park. The original boundaries went from the Atlantic Ocean, west to what is now [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|U.S. 441]], and from the north fork of Middle River north to Cypress Creek Boulevard, but when the boundaries were reestablished, it was to approximately the west side of [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. 1]], west to Northeast 3rd Avenue and the north fork of Middle River north to what is now Prospect Road. Over time, it has expanded to its current boundaries, mainly due to acquiring a few other areas, such as recent annexations of previously unincorporated neighborhoods of Twin Lakes South and North Andrews Gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oaklandparkfl.org/citygovernment/about/history.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219074015/http://www.oaklandparkfl.org/citygovernment/about/history.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-02-19 |title=About Oakland Park: History |publisher=The City of Oakland Park |accessdate=2015-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOakland Park is located at {{coord|26|10|35|N|80|8|40|W|type:city}} (26.176362, -80.144509).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|19.3|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.8|km2|order=flip}} (8.40%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nOakland Park is bisected by the [[Florida East Coast Railway]], which runs parallel to [[Dixie Highway]] through the city's downtown.

Production of the Century began in 1967, and the model received only minor changes until a redesign in 1997. The Century derived its name from the 100th birthday of [[Sakichi Toyoda]] (born 14 February 1867), the founder of Toyota Industries. It is often used by the [[Imperial House of Japan]], the [[Prime Minister of Japan]], senior Japanese government leaders, and high-level executive businessmen. The Century is comparable in purpose to the [[Austin Princess]]/[[Daimler DS420]], [[Cadillac Series 70]], [[Mercedes-Benz 600]], Chinese [[Hongqi (marque)|Red Flag]], [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]], and Russian [[ZIL-114|ZIS/ZIL]] limousines. The first-generation Century was available with only a V8 engine, the third Japanese-built sedan post-war, at its introduction in 1967 until a full platform redesign in 1997. The second generation was only installed with a Toyota-designed and -built V12, an engine unique to the Century, until 2018, when the power-train was reverted to a V8 with the addition of Toyota's hybrid technology. While the Century is a premium, full-size luxury sedan, it is not available at Japanese [[Lexus]] dealerships; it can only be purchased at specifically identified ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'' locations. The bird logo used throughout is called the ''[[Fenghuang|H\u014d'\u014d]]'' (\u9cf3\u51f0) or ''Fushich\u014d'' from Asian mythology, representing the [[Imperial House of Japan]], and the image can be found throughout Asia, such as the [[Kinkaku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/ho-oo-phoenix.shtml |title=Hou-ou (or Hoo-oo)\u2014the Japanese Phoenix |first=Mark |last=Schumacher |website=Onmark Productions |date=2011-08-27 |access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior styling of the Century has, with some modifications, remained unchanged since its introduction, primarily due to its perception as denoting conservative success. Its appearance is iconic in Asian countries and is usually painted black. The closest Japanese competitor was the [[Nissan President]], with a similar status reputation although, during the 1960s and '70s, the high market positioning was also shared with the [[Mitsubishi Debonair]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/Debo.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922171657/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/Debo.asp |archivedate=2008-09-22 |title=Mitsubishi Automotive History |publisher=Mitsubishi |location=South Africa |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> Other Japanese competitors introduced large sedans\u2014the [[Isuzu Statesman de Ville]] and the [[Mazda Roadpacer]] (derived from General Motors-Australia products)\u2014which were short-lived.\n\n=={{anchor|G20|G30|G40}} First generation (G20/G30/G40; 1967\u20131997)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1967 Toyota Century 01.jpg\n| name = First generation (G20/G30/G40)<ref>Toyota Century, Japanese sales brochure, circa 1990</ref>\n| production = November 1967 \u2013 March 1997\n| designer = Kenya Nakamura\n| assembly = Japan: [[Susono, Shizuoka]] ([[Kanto Auto Works]])<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web | url = http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/japan/general_status/toyota_motor_east_japan.html | title = Affiliates (Toyota wholly-owned subsidiaries)-Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc. | publisher = Toyota | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-07-15}}</ref>\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|2599|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota V engine#3V|3V]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (1967-1973)\n  | {{convert|3376|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota V engine#4V|4V]]'' V8 (1973-1982)\n  | {{convert|3994|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota V engine#5V|5V]]'' V8 (1982-1997)\n  }}\n| powerout = {{convert|150|\u2013|190|PS|kW|abbr=on|0}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 3/4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] (1967-1974)\n  | 3/4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n| length = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|5120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (standard)\n\n  | {{convert|5270|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (L-type)\n  | {{convert|5770|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (limousine)\n}}\n| width = {{convert|1890|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1430|-|1460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1760|-|1830|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|2860|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (standard)\n  | {{convert|3010|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (L-type)\n  | {{convert|3510|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (limousine)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe original Century was based on the 1964 [[Toyota Crown#Crown Eight|Crown Eight]], which featured the 2.6&nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]] ''[[Toyota V engine#V|Toyota V engine]]'', and appeared almost two years after the October 1965 introduction of the 4-liter [[Nissan President#President H150 and H250|Nissan President]]. The design remained largely untouched during its 30-year production run, apart from minor cosmetic changes and engine upgrades. This appearance has also inspired the designs of subsequent versions, as it remains desired by its clientele.\n\nThe 1967 Century was equipped with an upgraded version of the Crown Eight engine, the 3.0&nbsp;L ''3V''. 1973 saw the introduction of the 3.4&nbsp;L ''4V'', replaced by the ''4V-U'' two years later, benefitting from the installation of emission control technology Toyota called \"[[Toyota TTC|TTC]]\". Only column shifters were available at first, with a manual being the base option. The manually shifted versions (Type A and Type B) were discontinued in 1973 and August 1974 respectively. The 3.4-liter V8 received [[fuel injection]] in November 1978 (''4V-EU''), enabling the car to meet the [[Emission standard#Japan|1978 Emissions Standards]].<ref name=Catvol26>{{citation | ref = JAMA26 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1979/1980 | language = Japanese | volume = 26 | date = 1979-11-01 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 113 | id = 053-790026-3400 }}</ref> This also meant that the chassis code was changed, to '''VG35'''.<ref name=V26p118>''[[#JAMA26|Automobile Guide Book 1979/1980]]'', p. 118</ref> The engine was once again changed to the 4.0&nbsp;L ''5V-EU'' in November 1982 ('''VG40''').

The electromagnetic locks were changed, the tail lights were changed (now with amber turn signal lenses) as well as the inclusion of front disc brakes. In September 1987 the Century received another light makeover, changing from a hydraulically operated three-speed to an electronically operated four-speed automatic transmission. A floor-mounted shifter became available on a model called the D-type, which also had front bucket seats rather than a full-width bench. The grille received detail changes and the cornering lamps were integrated into the headlight surrounds.\n\nDuring Japan's [[Japanese asset price bubble|Bubble Economy]], sales of the Century doubled (from 1,027 in 1985 to 2,117 in 1989).<ref name=eichifive>{{Cite book |ref=Eichi5 |title=\u7d76\u7248\u8eca\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0 \u56fd\u7523\u8eca\u7de8 Part5 1980~1989 |trans-title=Japanese Historic Car Graffiti: Car Catalog part 5, 1980\u20131989 |language=Japanese |editor-last=Tazawa (\u7530\u6fa4) |editor-first=K\u014dichi (\u6643\u4e00) |publisher=Eichi Publishing (\u82f1\u77e5\u51fa\u7248) |series=Eichi Mook |location=Tokyo |page=5 |year=1997 |isbn=4-7542-5120-2}}</ref> The Century wasn't enough for these heady days, and in October 1989 the Century Limousine appeared.

The Limousine also received a standard padded [[vinyl roof]] and an [[opera window]] in the centre pillar, where the stretch was placed. It also uses 150&nbsp;mm wider rear doors, for a more balanced design and ease of entry. An annual production of 60 was planned.<ref name=eichifive/> As of September 1990 there was also an '''L-type''' stretched version of the Century \u2014 length is {{convert|5270|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a wheelbase of {{convert|3010|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}; this model uses the same larger rear doors as were fitted to the Century Limousine.

Today, it was positioned above the [[Lexus]] line-up, and remained the most luxurious and prestigious model to wear the Toyota badge. The Century shared the role of flagship with the [[Toyota Crown Majesta]] with almost identical dimensions to the Century but with a more modern approach and appearance that appealed to younger buyers, and both vehicles were exclusive to the ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'' dealership network in Japan. This generation no longer offered the ability to select which level of equipment preferred, designated as the D-Type, E-Type and the extended length L-Type of the previous generation, and changed to offering either a floor-mounted or column-mounted transmission selector.<ref name=\"Toyota Century Catalog\">{{cite web|title=Toyota Century Catalog|url=http://www.goo-net.com/catalog/TOYOTA/CENTURY/index.html|website=Goo-Net|publisher=Proto Corporation|accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref> From 2003 through 2004, the V12 engine was briefly offered the ability to use [[CNG]] fuel. On the [[C pillar|\"C\" pillar]] there is a badge in blue with a [[Blackletter|gothic-style]] \"C\" for Century with a label \"V12\" below.\n\nLike other cars in the top of the luxury class, the Century is designed with the rear passengers in mind. Hence, the rear seats recline and the front passenger seat has a fold-down center section so that a passenger in the back may stretch his feet forward. The rear seats are equipped with a massage system. The exterior door handles open the doors electrically since the sound of the door being opened mechanically is perceived as being \"too obtrusive\". The doors do not need to be closed directly, instead the door only needs to contact the latch, causing the door to pull itself completely closed electrically.<ref name=\"Toyota Century Catalog\"/>\n\nThe vehicles' interiors are usually ordered in [[wool]] cloth, rather than the leather seen in many luxury cars; leather is not as quiet as cloth when sat upon. The vehicle interior colors are limited to medium brown, light brown, burgundy, gray or royal blue inside, with a choice of five exterior colors including black. The Century is distinguished by different paint options than the rest of the Toyota line-up, and color choices have culturally significant names. They are (\u30ab\u30e0\u30a4) [[Kamui]] Eternal Black, (\u6469\u5468\u6e56) [[Lake Mash\u016b]] Shrine Blue Mica, (\u9e1e) [[Gemstone|Rinpo]] Glorious Gray Metallic, (\u7cbe\u83ef) [[Essence|Seika]] Radiant Silver Metallic and (\u5f69\u96f2) [[Cloud iridescence|Seiun Cloud]] Demure Blue Mica Metallic.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013 Toyota Century catalog|url=http://cdn.toyota-catalog.jp/catalog/pdf/century-3/century-3_201305.pdf|website=Toyota Century Catalog|publisher=Toyota Motor Corporation|year=2013|accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref> The painting of each car is one of the most detailed in the manufacturing process. It involves hand painting, followed by wet sanding by hand, then hand polishing to a mirror finish. The Century has seven layers of paint used to complete the mirror like appearance. Vehicles primarily intended for [[Taxicab livery|livery]] service usually have leather interiors in gray, for easier interior cleaning and durability. White lace curtains are usually installed in the rear window, instead of tinted windows, which are perceived to attract unwarranted attention. The passengers usually like to be seen in a Century, despite Asian tendencies for modesty.\n\nThe Century is priced at {{JPY|11,445,000}} (approximately {{USD|100,000|link=on}} {{as of|2009|lc=on}}). In comparison, the base price for the [[luxury vehicles#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|full-size luxury]] 2008 [[Lexus LS#USF40/USF41 (2006)|Lexus LS 460]] is approximately {{JPY|10,000,000}} ({{USD|87,000}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wardsdealer.com/latest/lexus_progressing_japan |title=Lexus Slowly Progressing in Japan |work=WardsAuto |first1=Roger |last1=Schreffler |first2=Mack |last2=Chrysler |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> with the LS 600h L at {{JPY|15,000,000}} ({{USD|125,800}}).\n\nIn 2006, the [[G-BOOK]] vehicle telematics subscription service was added to the list of standard features.\n\nAlthough the Century is generally not exported, it is frequently used by Japanese diplomats overseas. Around 100 cars were produced with [[Left- and right-hand traffic|left-hand drive]] starting in 1998, and were exported to Europe, the Middle East and the United States for promotional and testing purposes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://autoc-one.jp/toyota/century/special-1120901/0005.html|title=\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca \u88fd\u54c1\u4f01\u753b\u672c\u90e8 \u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc \u958b\u767a\u4e3b\u67fb \u6e05\u6c34 \u52c9 \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc(5/5){{!}}NEXTALK\u3010\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c3\u30af\u30ef\u30f3\u3011|work=\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c3\u30af\u30ef\u30f3|access-date=2018-08-03|language=ja-JP}}</ref> Several were in use as corporate cars for Toyota's North American executives.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/automobiles/what-the-heck-was-that-crazy-car.html |title=What the Heck Was That Crazy Car? |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |newspaper=The New York Times |location=US |date=2005-01-30 |access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to other luxurious cars (such as the [[Maybach]] or [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]]), the Century has not been positioned and marketed as a sign of wealth or excess.

This badge is a traditional Century styling feature that first appeared in 1967.\n\nThere are many features that are exclusive to the Century. The grille is the classic narrow vertical chrome strips with a second layer underneath of interlocking circles that are also used for the turn signals used in the front bumper. The rear taillights are also a traditional appearance which debuted with the first generation in 1967. As with previous generations, rear passenger comfort and convenience is made a priority. The rear seats have a recline feature, with integrated heaters and massage function, as well as an adjustable power leg rest for the rear seat opposite the driver. The sound system comes standard with 20 speakers. A 20-inch LCD screen is installed for rear seat passengers that let occupants control many aspects and features as a convenience as well as playing video content. The standard upholstery fabric continues to be offered in three color choices using 100% wool with a unique [[Heather (fabric)|heather pattern]], with leather remaining available optionally in two different color combinations. Both upholstery choices include two different wood inlay selections. The transmission selector, which on previous generations was either floor mounted or steering column installed, is now only available on the floor.\n\nIt is equipped with a 5.0-liter ''[[Toyota UR engine#2UR-FSE|2UR-FSE]]'' V8 engine part of the [[Hybrid Synergy Drive|Toyota Hybrid System II]], maintaining the previous displacement of the V12 engine with the convenience of an electric powertrain in urban driving environments and fuel expense savings, with a fuel economy of {{convert|13.6|km/L|abbr=on}}, while the previous generation had {{convert|10|km/L|abbr=on}}. The powertrain package was originally installed in the [[Lexus LS (XF40)#LS 600h|2008-2017 Lexus LS 600h & LS 600h L]]; with the introduction of the XF50 series Lexus LS which no longer offers a V8 engine, this powertrain will now be unique to the Century.<ref>{{cite news |title=NEWS: Toyota will introduce a new Century for only the third time in 50 years |url=http://japanesenostalgiccar.com/3rd-generation-toyota-century/#more-61776 |first=Ben |last=Hsu |work=Japanese Nostalgic Car |date=2017-10-05 |access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref> The suspension has been upgraded from the previous double wishbone to a [[multi-link suspension]] with supplemental air bags to further enhance ride quality.

Production of the Century began in 1967, and the model received only minor changes until a redesign in 1997. The Century derived its name from the 100th birthday of [[Sakichi Toyoda]] (born 14 February 1867), the founder of Toyota Industries. It is often used by the [[Imperial House of Japan]], the [[Prime Minister of Japan]], senior Japanese government leaders, and high-level executive businessmen. The Century is comparable in purpose to the [[Austin Princess]]/[[Daimler DS420]], [[Cadillac Series 70]], [[Mercedes-Benz 600]], Chinese [[Hongqi (marque)|Red Flag]], [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]], and Russian [[ZIL-114|ZIS/ZIL]] limousines. The first-generation Century was available with only a V8 engine, the third Japanese-built sedan post-war, at its introduction in 1967 until a full platform redesign in 1997. The second generation was only installed with a Toyota-designed and -built V12, an engine unique to the Century, until 2018, when the power-train was reverted to a V8 with the addition of Toyota's hybrid technology. While the Century is a premium, full-size luxury sedan, it is not available at Japanese [[Lexus]] dealerships; it can only be purchased at specifically identified ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'' locations. The bird logo used throughout is called the ''[[Fenghuang|H\u014d'\u014d]]'' (\u9cf3\u51f0) or ''Fushich\u014d'' from Asian mythology, representing the [[Imperial House of Japan]], and the image can be found throughout Asia, such as the [[Kinkaku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/ho-oo-phoenix.shtml |title=Hou-ou (or Hoo-oo)\u2014the Japanese Phoenix |first=Mark |last=Schumacher |website=Onmark Productions |date=2011-08-27 |access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior styling of the Century has, with some modifications, remained unchanged since its introduction, primarily due to its perception as denoting conservative success. Its appearance is iconic in Asian countries and is usually painted black. The closest Japanese competitor was the [[Nissan President]], with a similar status reputation although, during the 1960s and '70s, the high market positioning was also shared with the [[Mitsubishi Debonair]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/Debo.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922171657/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/Debo.asp |archivedate=2008-09-22 |title=Mitsubishi Automotive History |publisher=Mitsubishi |location=South Africa |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> Other Japanese competitors introduced large sedans\u2014the [[Isuzu Statesman de Ville]] and the [[Mazda Roadpacer]] (derived from General Motors-Australia products)\u2014which were short-lived.\n\n=={{anchor|G20|G30|G40}} First generation (G20/G30/G40; 1967\u20131997)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1967 Toyota Century 01.jpg\n| name = First generation (G20/G30/G40)<ref>Toyota Century, Japanese sales brochure, circa 1990</ref>\n| production = November 1967 \u2013 March 1997\n| designer = Kenya Nakamura\n| assembly = Japan: [[Susono, Shizuoka]] ([[Kanto Auto Works]])<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web | url = http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/japan/general_status/toyota_motor_east_japan.html | title = Affiliates (Toyota wholly-owned subsidiaries)-Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc. | publisher = Toyota | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-07-15}}</ref>\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|2599|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota V engine#3V|3V]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (1967-1973)\n  | {{convert|3376|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota V engine#4V|4V]]'' V8 (1973-1982)\n  | {{convert|3994|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Toyota V engine#5V|5V]]'' V8 (1982-1997)\n  }}\n| powerout = {{convert|150|\u2013|190|PS|kW|abbr=on|0}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 3/4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] (1967-1974)\n  | 3/4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n| length = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|5120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (standard)\n\n  | {{convert|5270|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (L-type)\n  | {{convert|5770|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (limousine)\n}}\n| width = {{convert|1890|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1430|-|1460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1760|-|1830|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|2860|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (standard)\n  | {{convert|3010|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (L-type)\n  | {{convert|3510|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (limousine)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe original Century was based on the 1964 [[Toyota Crown#Crown Eight|Crown Eight]], which featured the 2.6&nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]] ''[[Toyota V engine#V|Toyota V engine]]'', and appeared almost two years after the October 1965 introduction of the 4-liter [[Nissan President#President H150 and H250|Nissan President]]. The design remained largely untouched during its 30-year production run, apart from minor cosmetic changes and engine upgrades. This appearance has also inspired the designs of subsequent versions, as it remains desired by its clientele.\n\nThe 1967 Century was equipped with an upgraded version of the Crown Eight engine, the 3.0&nbsp;L ''3V''. 1973 saw the introduction of the 3.4&nbsp;L ''4V'', replaced by the ''4V-U'' two years later, benefitting from the installation of emission control technology Toyota called \"[[Toyota TTC|TTC]]\". Only column shifters were available at first, with a manual being the base option. The manually shifted versions (Type A and Type B) were discontinued in 1973 and August 1974 respectively. The 3.4-liter V8 received [[fuel injection]] in November 1978 (''4V-EU''), enabling the car to meet the [[Emission standard#Japan|1978 Emissions Standards]].<ref name=Catvol26>{{citation | ref = JAMA26 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1979/1980 | language = Japanese | volume = 26 | date = 1979-11-01 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 113 | id = 053-790026-3400 }}</ref> This also meant that the chassis code was changed, to '''VG35'''.<ref name=V26p118>''[[#JAMA26|Automobile Guide Book 1979/1980]]'', p. 118</ref> The engine was once again changed to the 4.0&nbsp;L ''5V-EU'' in November 1982 ('''VG40''').

The electromagnetic locks were changed, the tail lights were changed (now with amber turn signal lenses) as well as the inclusion of front disc brakes. In September 1987 the Century received another light makeover, changing from a hydraulically operated three-speed to an electronically operated four-speed automatic transmission. A floor-mounted shifter became available on a model called the D-type, which also had front bucket seats rather than a full-width bench. The grille received detail changes and the cornering lamps were integrated into the headlight surrounds.\n\nDuring Japan's [[Japanese asset price bubble|Bubble Economy]], sales of the Century doubled (from 1,027 in 1985 to 2,117 in 1989).<ref name=eichifive>{{Cite book |ref=Eichi5 |title=\u7d76\u7248\u8eca\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0 \u56fd\u7523\u8eca\u7de8 Part5 1980~1989 |trans-title=Japanese Historic Car Graffiti: Car Catalog part 5, 1980\u20131989 |language=Japanese |editor-last=Tazawa (\u7530\u6fa4) |editor-first=K\u014dichi (\u6643\u4e00) |publisher=Eichi Publishing (\u82f1\u77e5\u51fa\u7248) |series=Eichi Mook |location=Tokyo |page=5 |year=1997 |isbn=4-7542-5120-2}}</ref> The Century wasn't enough for these heady days, and in October 1989 the Century Limousine appeared.

The Limousine also received a standard padded [[vinyl roof]] and an [[opera window]] in the centre pillar, where the stretch was placed. It also uses 150&nbsp;mm wider rear doors, for a more balanced design and ease of entry. An annual production of 60 was planned.<ref name=eichifive/> As of September 1990 there was also an '''L-type''' stretched version of the Century \u2014 length is {{convert|5270|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a wheelbase of {{convert|3010|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}; this model uses the same larger rear doors as were fitted to the Century Limousine.

It also features air suspension. The Century remains the first and only Japanese [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]] production car equipped with a V12, and it is Toyota's first V12 engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/engines/index.html |title=75 Years of TOYOTA {{!}} Technical Development {{!}} Engines |publisher=Toyota |year=2012 |accessdate=2015-01-02}}</ref> As this is a top level luxury flagship, private owners are comfortable with the yearly [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] bill.\n\nThe Century was Toyota's most luxurious model at its inception in 1967, and maintained this status throughout the 20th century. Today, it was positioned above the [[Lexus]] line-up, and remained the most luxurious and prestigious model to wear the Toyota badge. The Century shared the role of flagship with the [[Toyota Crown Majesta]] with almost identical dimensions to the Century but with a more modern approach and appearance that appealed to younger buyers, and both vehicles were exclusive to the ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'' dealership network in Japan. This generation no longer offered the ability to select which level of equipment preferred, designated as the D-Type, E-Type and the extended length L-Type of the previous generation, and changed to offering either a floor-mounted or column-mounted transmission selector.<ref name=\"Toyota Century Catalog\">{{cite web|title=Toyota Century Catalog|url=http://www.goo-net.com/catalog/TOYOTA/CENTURY/index.html|website=Goo-Net|publisher=Proto Corporation|accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref> From 2003 through 2004, the V12 engine was briefly offered the ability to use [[CNG]] fuel. On the [[C pillar|\"C\" pillar]] there is a badge in blue with a [[Blackletter|gothic-style]] \"C\" for Century with a label \"V12\" below.\n\nLike other cars in the top of the luxury class, the Century is designed with the rear passengers in mind. Hence, the rear seats recline and the front passenger seat has a fold-down center section so that a passenger in the back may stretch his feet forward. The rear seats are equipped with a massage system. The exterior door handles open the doors electrically since the sound of the door being opened mechanically is perceived as being \"too obtrusive\". The doors do not need to be closed directly, instead the door only needs to contact the latch, causing the door to pull itself completely closed electrically.<ref name=\"Toyota Century Catalog\"/>\n\nThe vehicles' interiors are usually ordered in [[wool]] cloth, rather than the leather seen in many luxury cars; leather is not as quiet as cloth when sat upon. The vehicle interior colors are limited to medium brown, light brown, burgundy, gray or royal blue inside, with a choice of five exterior colors including black. The Century is distinguished by different paint options than the rest of the Toyota line-up, and color choices have culturally significant names. They are (\u30ab\u30e0\u30a4) [[Kamui]] Eternal Black, (\u6469\u5468\u6e56) [[Lake Mash\u016b]] Shrine Blue Mica, (\u9e1e) [[Gemstone|Rinpo]] Glorious Gray Metallic, (\u7cbe\u83ef) [[Essence|Seika]] Radiant Silver Metallic and (\u5f69\u96f2) [[Cloud iridescence|Seiun Cloud]] Demure Blue Mica Metallic.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013 Toyota Century catalog|url=http://cdn.toyota-catalog.jp/catalog/pdf/century-3/century-3_201305.pdf|website=Toyota Century Catalog|publisher=Toyota Motor Corporation|year=2013|accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref> The painting of each car is one of the most detailed in the manufacturing process. It involves hand painting, followed by wet sanding by hand, then hand polishing to a mirror finish. The Century has seven layers of paint used to complete the mirror like appearance. Vehicles primarily intended for [[Taxicab livery|livery]] service usually have leather interiors in gray, for easier interior cleaning and durability. White lace curtains are usually installed in the rear window, instead of tinted windows, which are perceived to attract unwarranted attention. The passengers usually like to be seen in a Century, despite Asian tendencies for modesty.\n\nThe Century is priced at {{JPY|11,445,000}} (approximately {{USD|100,000|link=on}} {{as of|2009|lc=on}}). In comparison, the base price for the [[luxury vehicles#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|full-size luxury]] 2008 [[Lexus LS#USF40/USF41 (2006)|Lexus LS 460]] is approximately {{JPY|10,000,000}} ({{USD|87,000}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wardsdealer.com/latest/lexus_progressing_japan |title=Lexus Slowly Progressing in Japan |work=WardsAuto |first1=Roger |last1=Schreffler |first2=Mack |last2=Chrysler |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> with the LS 600h L at {{JPY|15,000,000}} ({{USD|125,800}}).\n\nIn 2006, the [[G-BOOK]] vehicle telematics subscription service was added to the list of standard features.\n\nAlthough the Century is generally not exported, it is frequently used by Japanese diplomats overseas.

The grille is the classic narrow vertical chrome strips with a second layer underneath of interlocking circles that are also used for the turn signals used in the front bumper. The rear taillights are also a traditional appearance which debuted with the first generation in 1967. As with previous generations, rear passenger comfort and convenience is made a priority. The rear seats have a recline feature, with integrated heaters and massage function, as well as an adjustable power leg rest for the rear seat opposite the driver. The sound system comes standard with 20 speakers. A 20-inch LCD screen is installed for rear seat passengers that let occupants control many aspects and features as a convenience as well as playing video content. The standard upholstery fabric continues to be offered in three color choices using 100% wool with a unique [[Heather (fabric)|heather pattern]], with leather remaining available optionally in two different color combinations. Both upholstery choices include two different wood inlay selections.

The powertrain package was originally installed in the [[Lexus LS (XF40)#LS 600h|2008-2017 Lexus LS 600h & LS 600h L]]; with the introduction of the XF50 series Lexus LS which no longer offers a V8 engine, this powertrain will now be unique to the Century.<ref>{{cite news |title=NEWS: Toyota will introduce a new Century for only the third time in 50 years |url=http://japanesenostalgiccar.com/3rd-generation-toyota-century/#more-61776 |first=Ben |last=Hsu |work=Japanese Nostalgic Car |date=2017-10-05 |access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref> The suspension has been upgraded from the previous double wishbone to a [[multi-link suspension]] with supplemental air bags to further enhance ride quality.

The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u028e}}, a rotated lowercase letter {{angbr|y}} (not to be confused with lowercase [[lambda]], {{angbr|\u03bb}}), and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>L</code>.\n\nMany languages that were previously thought to have a palatal lateral approximant actually have a lateral approximant that is, broadly, [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]]; that is to say, it is articulated at a place in-between the [[alveolar ridge]] and the [[hard palate]] (excluded), and it may be variously described as alveolo-palatal, lamino-postalveolar,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013|p=2}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1997|p=602}}</ref> or postalveolo-prepalatal.<ref name=\"recasens1993p222\">{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Farnetani|Fontdevila|Pallar\u00e8s|1993|p=222}}</ref> None of the 13 languages investigated by {{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013}}, many of them [[Romance languages|Romance]], has a 'true' palatal.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013|p=11}}</ref> That is likely the case for several other languages listed here.

The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u028e}}, a rotated lowercase letter {{angbr|y}} (not to be confused with lowercase [[lambda]], {{angbr|\u03bb}}), and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>L</code>.\n\nMany languages that were previously thought to have a palatal lateral approximant actually have a lateral approximant that is, broadly, [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]]; that is to say, it is articulated at a place in-between the [[alveolar ridge]] and the [[hard palate]] (excluded), and it may be variously described as alveolo-palatal, lamino-postalveolar,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013|p=2}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1997|p=602}}</ref> or postalveolo-prepalatal.<ref name=\"recasens1993p222\">{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Farnetani|Fontdevila|Pallar\u00e8s|1993|p=222}}</ref> None of the 13 languages investigated by {{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013}}, many of them [[Romance languages|Romance]], has a 'true' palatal.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013|p=11}}</ref> That is likely the case for several other languages listed here. Some languages, like Portuguese and Catalan, have a lateral approximant that varies between alveolar and alveolo-palatal.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|2013|pp=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThere is no dedicated symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the '''alveolo-palatal lateral approximant'''. If precision is desired, it may be transcribed {{angbr IPA|l\u0320\u02b2}} or {{angbr IPA|\u028e\u031f}}; they are essentially equivalent because the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. There is also a non-IPA letter {{angbr IPA|\u0234}} (\"l\", plus the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives {{angle brackets|{{IPA link|\u0255}}, {{IPA link|\u0291}}}}), used especially in Sinological circles.\n\nThe palatal lateral approximant contrasts phonemically with its [[Voiceless palatal lateral approximant|voiceless counterpart]] {{IPA|/\u028e\u0325/}} in the [[Xumi language]] spoken in China.<ref name=\"chir1\">{{Harvcoltxt|Chirkova|Chen|2013|pp=365, 367\u2013368}}</ref><ref name=\"chir2\">{{Harvcoltxt|Chirkova|Chen|Kocjan\u010di\u010d Antol\u00edk|2013|pp=382\u2013383}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nFeatures of the voiced palatal lateral approximant:\n\n{{approximant}}\n{{palatal}}\n{{voiced}}\n{{oral}}\n{{lateral}}\n{{pulmonic}}\n\n== Occurrence ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
