They created the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), with the aim of recruiting a candidate for the 1988 election.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe large gains in the [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986 mid-term elections]] (which resulted in the Democrats taking back control of the Senate after six years of Republican rule) and the continuing [[Iran Contra]] scandal gave Democrats confidence in the run-up to the primary season.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Candidates==\n===Nominee===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

[[Michael Dukakis]] later acknowledged that his campaign was responsible for leaking the tape, and two members of his staff resigned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAllegations were also leaked to the press that Biden had been guilty of plagiarism years before, in law school.

In the [[New Hampshire primary]], Dukakis finished first, Gephardt finished second, and Simon finished third. Dukakis and Gore campaigned hard against Gephardt with negative ads, and eventually the [[United Auto Workers]] retracted their endorsement of Gephardt, who was heavily dependent on labor union backing.\n\nIn the [[Super Tuesday]] races, Dukakis won six primaries, Gore five, Jackson five and Gephardt one, with Gore and Jackson splitting the southern states. The next week, Simon won Illinois. 1988 is tied with 1992 as the race with the most candidates winning primaries since the McGovern reforms of 1971. Gore's effort to paint Dukakis as too liberal for the general election proved unsuccessful and he eventually withdrew. Jackson focused more on getting enough delegates to make sure African-American interests were represented in the platform than on winning outright.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Juan|title=Waiting for The Jackson Reaction; Will Jesse End His Crusade With a Bang or a Whimper?|date=1988-07-17|work=The Washington Post|page=C1}}</ref> Dukakis eventually emerged as the party's nominee.\n===Statewide===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

In 1966, he attended Virginia Tech and played football. He was a starting [[cornerback]] for 3 years, playing in the [[1966 Liberty Bowl|1966]] and [[1968 Liberty Bowl|1968]] [[Liberty Bowl]]s. He graduated from [[Virginia Tech]] in 1969 and attended [[Radford University]] for graduate school, while serving as an assistant football coach at [[Radford High School (Virginia)|Radford High School]].\n\n==Coaching career==\n===Early coaching positions===\nBeamer began as an assistant at [[Radford High School (Virginia)|Radford High School]] from 1969 through 1971. His college coaching experience began in 1972, when he became a graduate assistant for the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. After one season, he became an assistant coach at [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] under [[Bobby Ross]]. He spent seven seasons at The Citadel, the last two as the [[defensive coordinator]].\n\n===Murray State===\nBeamer was hired as the defensive coordinator at [[Murray State University]] in 1979 under head coach, [[Mike Gottfried]]. In 1981, after two seasons as defensive coordinator, he was promoted to head coach. In his six years as head coach, Beamer compiled a record of 42\u201323\u20132 (.642).

However, Dooley had been forced to resign due to numerous [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA violations]]. Beamer signed a four-year contract worth $80,000 annually, hired by Virginia Tech's new [[athletic director]], Dale Baughman, also replacing Dooley in that capacity. Beamer took over a [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech football]] program that had reached six [[bowl game]]s to that point (three under Dooley).\n\nAs a result of the violations uncovered under Dooley's watch, the Hokies were limited to 85 total scholarships in 1988 and 1989, and 17 initial scholarships in 1989. The sanctions hampered the Hokies, and Beamer went a combined 5\u201317 in 1987 and 1988. Beamer's record in his first six seasons was 24-40-2, a win percentage of .385. After the team went 2\u20138\u20131 in 1992, athletic director Dave Braine believed in Beamer and thought he deserved more time.

The courtroom shooting left five people dead, including the judge, a prosecutor, and the county sheriff.<ref name=\"theroanoker\">{{cite web |url=http://theroanoker.com/articles/frank-beamer/index.html |title=Tempered Steel: How Frank Beamer Got That Way \u2013 TheRoanoker.com |publisher=theroanoker.com|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, at the age of seven, Beamer suffered a life altering accident. After using a push broom to keep a pile of burning trash in place, he returned it to its place in the garage, unaware that it was smoldering. A spark ignited a nearby can of [[gasoline]], which exploded in front of him. His 11-year-old brother, Barnett saved him by rolling him around on the ground. He was left with burns on his shoulders, chest, and the right side of his neck.

In 1966, he attended Virginia Tech and played football. He was a starting [[cornerback]] for 3 years, playing in the [[1966 Liberty Bowl|1966]] and [[1968 Liberty Bowl|1968]] [[Liberty Bowl]]s. He graduated from [[Virginia Tech]] in 1969 and attended [[Radford University]] for graduate school, while serving as an assistant football coach at [[Radford High School (Virginia)|Radford High School]].\n\n==Coaching career==\n===Early coaching positions===\nBeamer began as an assistant at [[Radford High School (Virginia)|Radford High School]] from 1969 through 1971. His college coaching experience began in 1972, when he became a graduate assistant for the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. After one season, he became an assistant coach at [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] under [[Bobby Ross]]. He spent seven seasons at The Citadel, the last two as the [[defensive coordinator]].\n\n===Murray State===\nBeamer was hired as the defensive coordinator at [[Murray State University]] in 1979 under head coach, [[Mike Gottfried]]. In 1981, after two seasons as defensive coordinator, he was promoted to head coach. In his six years as head coach, Beamer compiled a record of 42\u201323\u20132 (.642). He hired former Murray State defensive back, [[Bud Foster]] as a graduate assistant in 1981. Foster later joined Beamer's coaching staff at Virginia Tech in 1987.\n\n===Virginia Tech ===\n====Early years (1987\u20131992)====\n[[File:Frank Beamer 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Beamer during the 1987 football season]]\nOn December 22, 1986, Beamer was hired as the head coach at Virginia Tech, replacing [[Bill Dooley]], the winningest coach in school history to date. However, Dooley had been forced to resign due to numerous [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA violations]]. Beamer signed a four-year contract worth $80,000 annually, hired by Virginia Tech's new [[athletic director]], Dale Baughman, also replacing Dooley in that capacity. Beamer took over a [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech football]] program that had reached six [[bowl game]]s to that point (three under Dooley).\n\nAs a result of the violations uncovered under Dooley's watch, the Hokies were limited to 85 total scholarships in 1988 and 1989, and 17 initial scholarships in 1989. The sanctions hampered the Hokies, and Beamer went a combined 5\u201317 in 1987 and 1988. Beamer's record in his first six seasons was 24-40-2, a win percentage of .385. After the team went 2\u20138\u20131 in 1992, athletic director Dave Braine believed in Beamer and thought he deserved more time. It proved to be a wise decision; the Hokies would not suffer another losing season under Beamer's watch.<ref name=\"godanriver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.godanriver.com/sports/virginia_tech/frank-beamer-dave-braine-recall-early-struggles/article_68b02de4-bf9e-5781-98b4-a99a0fbc5db5.html|title=Frank Beamer, Dave Braine recall early struggles|last=981-3125|first=Mark Berman mark.berman@roanoke.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/14030242/virginia-tech-coach-frank-beamer-career-reminder-different-era-college-football|title=Maisel: Frank Beamer had the benefit of time at Virginia Tech|publisher=}}</ref><ref>https://www.roanoke.com/z-no-digital/frank-beamer-recalls-the-good-fortune-that-led-to-his/article_990afbab-66bc-5fbe-bb6d-2c8e3811c02f.html</ref><ref>https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19921126-1992-11-26-9211260137-story.html</ref> <ref>https://theathletic.com/684143/2018/11/29/virginia-tech-last-bowl-less-team-1992/</ref> At his hall of fame induction, Beamer said he would have been unlikely to survive his early years had he been coaching in the 2010s. <ref>https://www.roanoke.com/hokies/hall-of-fame-honor-a-snug-fit-for-former-virginia/article_3e9c9e9a-f7eb-11e8-be1c-23a0ed634905.html</ref>\n\n====Big East (1993\u20132003)====\nIn 1993, the Hokies would go 9-3 and won the [[1993 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]]; at the time, it was only the fourth time in school history that the Hokies had won as many as nine games in a season. The Hokies would go on to a combined record of 75\u201321 from 1993 to 2000. This included the Hokies' first major-bowl appearances in school history, after the 1995, 1996 and 1999 seasons. The peak year in this stretch was 1999, when the Hokies went 11\u20130 in the regular season earning a spot to the [[2000 Sugar Bowl]] to play [[1999 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] for the [[BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]].

Over the course of the next seven seasons, from 2005 to 2011, Virginia Tech won at least 10 games every season. The Hokies were the only team in the country to do so.

Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending [[English claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn 1415, [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry embarked on war with France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering France. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, he conquered large portions of the kingdom, resulting in [[Normandy]]'s occupation by the English for the first time since 1345\u20131360. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognised Henry V as regent and [[heir apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. Everything seemed to point to the formation of a [[Dual monarchy of England and France|union between the kingdoms]], [[Personal union|in the person]] of Henry. However, he died two years later and was succeeded by his only child, the infant [[King Henry VI]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of [[Monmouth Castle]] in [[Wales]], and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allmand |date=23 September 2010 |first=C. |title=Henry V (1386\u20131422) |url=https://archive.is/klEKs |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |type=online |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12952 |ref=harv }}</ref> He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later [[Henry IV of England]]) and [[Mary de Bohun]].

Another document, located at [[John Rylands Library]] ([https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/Man4MedievalVC~4~4~992364~159620 French MS 54]), gives the specific date of 16 September 1386.

Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Supposed riotous youth===\nIt may be that the tradition of Henry's riotous youth, immortalised by [[Shakespeare]], is partly due to political enmity. Henry's record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition.

His descendants objected and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir [[John Fastolf]]). That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to [[Thomas Arundel]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes.

Afterwards, Henry decided to march with his army across the French countryside towards [[Calais]] despite the warnings of his council.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barker |date=2005 |first=J. |title=Agincourt: Henry V and the Battle That Made England |url={{google books|W2jTtdISwMMC|plainurl=yes}} |place=London |p=220 |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv }}</ref> On 25 October, on the plains near the village of [[Azincourt|Agincourt]], a French army intercepted his route. Despite his men-at-arms being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively [[Battle of Agincourt|defeating the French]], who suffered severe losses. It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDuring the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been used for ransom.  Cambridge historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.\n\n=====Diplomacy and command of the sea=====\nCommand of the sea was secured by driving the [[Genoa|Genoese]] allies of the French out of the [[English Channel]].<ref name=EB1911/> While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from [[Beachy Head]] on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]] from France and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)|Treaty of Canterbury]] in 1416 paved the way to end the [[Western Schism]] in the Church.\n\n=====1417\u201320 campaign=====\n[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Late 15th-century depiction of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. [[British Library]], London.]]\n\nWith those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. After [[Siege of Caen (1417)|taking Caen]], Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and besieged. [[Siege of Rouen|This siege]] cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War|disputes]] between [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]]. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn January 1419, Rouen fell.<ref name=EB1911/> Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: [[Alain Blanchard]], who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; Robert de Livet, [[Rouen Cathedral|Canon of Rouen]], who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kingsford |date=1901 |first=C. |title=Henry V: The Typical Medi\u00e6val Hero |url=https://archive.org/details/henryvtypicalmed00kinguoft |publisher=GP Putnam's Sons |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nBy August, the English were outside the walls of [[Paris]]. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the [[assassination of John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s partisans at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] on 10 September. [[Philip the Good]], the new duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months of negotiation, the [[Treaty of Troyes]] recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France (see [[English Kings of France]]),<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |last=Kingsford |first=C. |display=Henry V (1387\u20131422) |volume=13 |wstitle=Henry V. of England |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford<!-- |editorlink=Hugh Chisholm--> |mode=cs2 |inline=1}}</ref> and on 2 June 1420 at [[Troyes Cathedral]], he married [[Catherine of Valois]], the French king's daughter. They had only one son, Henry, born on 6 December 1421 at [[Windsor Castle]]. From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau-Fault-Yonne, to once again see the English take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\n=====1421 campaign=====\nWhile he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence]], led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured [[Dreux]], thus relieving allied forces at [[Chartres]]. On 6 October, his forces [[Siege of Meaux|laid siege]] to [[Meaux]], capturing it on 11 May 1422.\n\n==Death==\nHenry V died suddenly on 31 August 1422, at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]]. He was thought to have died from [[dysentery]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/henry_v_king.shtml Henry V (c. 1387\u20131422). BBC]</ref> supposedly contracted during the [[siege of Meaux]]. However, a severe and lethal contraction of dysentery would have probably incapacitated him long before the end of August. Another plausible cause of death is [[heatstroke]]; the last day he was active he had been riding in full armour in blistering heat.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castor |first1=Helen |title=Joan of Arc |date=2015 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=9780571284634}}</ref>  He was 35 years old and had reigned for nine years.\n\nShortly before his death, Henry V named his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], regent of France in the name of his son, [[Henry VI of England]], then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because the sickly Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months.\n\nHenry's comrade-in-arms and [[Lord Steward]], [[John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley]], brought Henry's body back to England and bore the [[royal standard]] at his funeral.<ref>{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = Derek | year = 2005 | title = The Uncrowned Kings of England: The Black History of the Dudleys and the Tudor Throne | publisher = Carroll & Graf | isbn = 0-7867-1469-7}}.</ref> Henry V was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 November 1422.

He was the second English monarch of the [[House of Lancaster]]. Despite his relatively short reign, Henry's outstanding military successes in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against [[Kingdom of France|France]] made England one of the strongest military powers in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ross |date=28 July 1999 |first=C. |title=Henry V, king of England |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-V-king-of-England |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |authorlink=Charles Ross (historian) |ref=harv }}</ref> Immortalised in [[Shakespeare]]'s \"[[Henriad]]\" plays, Henry is known and celebrated as one of the greatest warrior kings of [[medieval England]].\n\nDuring the reign of his father [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], Henry gained military experience fighting the Welsh during the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|revolt]] of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] and against the powerful aristocratic [[Percy family]] of [[Northumberland]] at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]]. Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending [[English claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn 1415, [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry embarked on war with France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering France. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, he conquered large portions of the kingdom, resulting in [[Normandy]]'s occupation by the English for the first time since 1345\u20131360. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognised Henry V as regent and [[heir apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]].

A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by [[ecclesiastical]] statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles.

It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDuring the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been used for ransom.  Cambridge historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown.

A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from [[Beachy Head]] on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]] from France and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)|Treaty of Canterbury]] in 1416 paved the way to end the [[Western Schism]] in the Church.\n\n=====1417\u201320 campaign=====\n[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Late 15th-century depiction of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]].

After [[Siege of Caen (1417)|taking Caen]], Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and besieged. [[Siege of Rouen|This siege]] cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War|disputes]] between [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]].

From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau-Fault-Yonne, to once again see the English take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\n=====1421 campaign=====\nWhile he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence]], led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured [[Dreux]], thus relieving allied forces at [[Chartres]].

Throughout the summer, Mika and the mysterious caller continue to communicate, and agree to meet each other once school starts again. The caller turns out to be Hiro, a delinquent-like boy that Mika is initially afraid of, who shows proof of his identity as the caller with a photo of the sky on his cellular phone.\n\nFrom her friends and through her first sexual encounter with Hiro, Mika learns that he had a girlfriend named Saki. Although Hiro reassures her that he broke up with her, Saki, who still is in love with Hiro, holds a vendetta against Mika and hires a group of men to rape her. The horrific encounter ends with Hiro and his older sister Minako punishing both the men and Saki, but Mika continues to be harassed at school when Saki spreads rumors about her. Hiro protects Mika from all of the bullying advances, but she assures him that she's not frightened from being with him.\n\nMika later becomes pregnant after she and Hiro consummate in the school library. Hiro is thrilled by the news and both of them gain Hiro's parents' permission to raise the child together, although Mika's parents disapprove of the action. Despite this, Mika is determined to have the baby. After an altercation with Saki, the baby's birth ends in a miscarriage. Despaired, Mika and Hiro build a grave for their baby and promise each other to come visit the memorial yearly on the day of the baby's death.\n\nShortly after their second year in high school begins, Hiro begins to distance himself from Mika and breaks up with her. Although hurt, Mika meets a college student named Y\u016b at a [[Group dating|g\u014dkon]], who becomes sympathetic to her situation. The two date, and Y\u016b even prevents Mika's parents from divorcing. On the day of the baby's death, Mika finds Hiro visiting the grave as per their promise. The next year, she continues to move on from Hiro; however, on the day of the baby's death, Mika finds Nozomu at the grave. Nozomu reveals Hiro's illness, and that he was asked by Hiro himself to watch over Mika.\n\nMika breaks up with Y\u016b and finds Hiro in the hospital, diagnosed with cancer, with only three months left to live. Upset that he pretended he didn't love her only to ensure she would have a happy future, she insists that only he can make her happy. Hiro eventually gives into his feelings and gets back together with her. Mika begins to visit the hospital daily, even taking an academic leave, to take care of Hiro, who slowly begins to show signs of recovery. Hiro's resolve to live becomes stronger until he dies during a check-up. Mika is saddened by Hiro's death and tries to commit suicide, but is stopped by a flock of birds flying towards her. She takes this as a sign of Hiro, in the sky, discouraging her from killing herself, and realizes through this and Hiro's journal that he would have wanted her to continue to live.
