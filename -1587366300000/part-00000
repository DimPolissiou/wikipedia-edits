Avni's father is the famous film director Ashish Mehta who meets them in secret due to his mother, Dayawanti Mehta; a deeply religious [[Hindu]] woman who disapproves of his relationship with Ayesha who is a  [[Muslim]]. Dayawanti rejects Avni at every step determined for her son to break his relations with his \"illegitimate\" family. Ashish is forced to marry Neela Parikh, a kind-hearted lady. Avni becomes friends with Neela who helps Avni in her battle for justice by fighting against Dayawanti for Avni's rights.\n\nAyesha gives birth to her and Ashish's son, Aman. Dayawanti suffocates and murders Ayesha and takes Aman away renaming him Amol. She also manipulates an emotionally distraught Ashish into believing that Avni killed Ayesha. Ashish, blindly believing Dayawanti, sends Avni behind bars. Neela gets her out of prison and decides to leave with Avni. Dayawanti tricks Avni into meeting her alone and shoots her but Neela saves her.\n\n===15 years later===\n\nAvni is now a grown woman and uses the name Ananya Verma. She steals money from rich people and donates it to hospitals. ACP Neil Khanna is recruited to find out her identity. Avni's childhood friend, Ali is shown to be Neil's best friend.\n\nA series of events bring Avni and Neil closer. Meanwhile, Aman is shown to have grown into a spoilt brat. Neil starts developing a soft corner for Avni after Neela tells him about her childhood. After a series of investigations, it is revealed that Ashish was murdered by Dayawanti after he had discovered that she was Ayesha's murderer. Dayawanti is arrested. Neil gets critically injured in a bomb blast but is saved by Avni. It is revealed that the blast was planned by Aman, who is working for Dayawanti.\n\nNeil falls in love with Avni. Aman realises Dayawanti has been using him and turns over a new leaf. Circumstances end in Aman burning Dayawanti alive, which results in her death and him being sentenced. Avni forgives Aman and feels proud of him for getting justice for their mother Ayesha.\n\nJuhi tells Neil about \"their\" illegitimate daughter, Mishti who is being held captive by Vidyut. Avni rescues Mishti and they bond. It is then revealed that Mishti is in fact Vidyut's daughter. Avni and Neil find out Juhi's truth and get her to confess. Vidyut makes it look like Avni shot Juhi forcing Neil to put Avni behind bars.\n\n===6 months later===\n\nHeartbroken by the accusation of killing Juhi and the lack of trust between her and Neil, Avni learns fighting skills in prison to fight against the crimes she didn\u2019t commit. Neil manages to get Vidyut to confess that Avni is innocent. Neela gets shot during a black out at the Khanna house. Avni mourns over Neela's death. Eventually, Avni and Neil consummate their relationship.\n\nVidyut threatens Avni to marry him in order to save Prakash. Avni decides to burn Vidyut's house. The fire fighters find two dead bodies in the house leaving Avni's fate unknown.\n\n===10 years later===\n\nNeil quits his job as a police officer and becomes a radio jockey. Avni dedicates her life to the well-being of illegitimate children in an orphanage. She takes care of Sayesha, who is actually Mishti, along with other orphaned children. Sayesha is shown to be an aspiring singer and an ardent fan of actor Karan Kapoor.\n\nAvni decides to leave the city with her and Neil's son Mowgli so that Neil can start a new life with Mitali while Mitali asks Neil to return to Avni as he can only be happy with her.

Avni's father is the famous film director Ashish Mehta who meets them in secret due to his mother, Dayawanti Mehta; a deeply religious [[Hindu]] woman who disapproves of his relationship with Ayesha who is a  [[Muslim]]. Dayawanti rejects Avni at every step determined for her son to break his relations with his \"illegitimate\" family. Ashish is forced to marry Neela Parikh, a kind-hearted lady. Avni becomes friends with Neela who helps Avni in her battle for justice by fighting against Dayawanti for Avni's rights.\n\nAyesha gives birth to her and Ashish's son, Aman. Dayawanti suffocates and murders Ayesha and takes Aman away renaming him Amol. She also manipulates an emotionally distraught Ashish into believing that Avni killed Ayesha. Ashish, blindly believing Dayawanti, sends Avni behind bars. Neela gets her out of prison and decides to leave with Avni. Dayawanti tricks Avni into meeting her alone and shoots her but Neela saves her.\n\n===15 years later===\n\nAvni is now a grown woman and uses the name Ananya Verma. She steals money from rich people and donates it to hospitals. ACP Neil Khanna is recruited to find out her identity. Avni's childhood friend, Ali is shown to be Neil's best friend.\n\nA series of events bring Avni and Neil closer. Meanwhile, Aman is shown to have grown into a spoilt brat. Neil starts developing a soft corner for Avni after Neela tells him about her childhood. After a series of investigations, it is revealed that Ashish was murdered by Dayawanti after he had discovered that she was Ayesha's murderer. Dayawanti is arrested. Neil gets critically injured in a bomb blast but is saved by Avni. It is revealed that the blast was planned by Aman, who is working for Dayawanti.\n\nNeil falls in love with Avni. Aman realises Dayawanti has been using him and turns over a new leaf. Circumstances end in Aman burning Dayawanti alive, which results in her death and him being sentenced. Avni forgives Aman and feels proud of him for getting justice for their mother Ayesha.\n\nJuhi tells Neil about \"their\" illegitimate daughter, Mishti who is being held captive by Vidyut. Avni rescues Mishti and they bond. It is then revealed that Mishti is in fact Vidyut's daughter. Avni and Neil find out Juhi's truth and get her to confess. Vidyut makes it look like Avni shot Juhi forcing Neil to put Avni behind bars.\n\n===6 months later===\n\nHeartbroken by the accusation of killing Juhi and the lack of trust between her and Neil, Avni learns fighting skills in prison to fight against the crimes she didn\u2019t commit. Neil manages to get Vidyut to confess that Avni is innocent. Neela gets shot during a black out at the Khanna house. Avni mourns over Neela's death. Eventually, Avni and Neil consummate their relationship.\n\nVidyut threatens Avni to marry him in order to save Prakash. Avni decides to burn Vidyut's house. The fire fighters find two dead bodies in the house leaving Avni's fate unknown.\n\n===10 years later===\n\nNeil quits his job as a police officer and becomes a radio jockey. Avni dedicates her life to the well-being of illegitimate children in an orphanage. She takes care of Sayesha, who is actually Mishti, along with other orphaned children. Sayesha is shown to be an aspiring singer and an ardent fan of actor Karan Kapoor.\n\nAvni decides to leave the city with her and Neil's son Mowgli so that Neil can start a new life with Mitali while Mitali asks Neil to return to Avni as he can only be happy with her.

They also played four friendly games during the winter break, in [[Geneva]], [[Mannheim]] and [[Hanau]] as well as one game against [[AS Strasbourg|Strassburger FV]] in their home stadium [[Landhof]] in [[Basel]].\n\nThe [[1907\u201308 Swiss Serie A|1907\u201308 Serie A]] was divided into two regional groups, an East group and a West group. Together with local rivals [[BSC Old Boys Basel|Old Boys]], Basel were allocated to the East group.

FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]].\n\n== Overview ==\nBefore the season started, Basel played three test games, in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] and in [[Strassburg]]. They also played four friendly games during the winter break, in [[Geneva]], [[Mannheim]] and [[Hanau]] as well as one game against [[AS Strasbourg|Strassburger FV]] in their home stadium [[Landhof]] in [[Basel]].\n\nThe [[1907\u201308 Swiss Serie A|1907\u201308 Serie A]] was divided into two regional groups, an East group and a West group. Together with local rivals [[BSC Old Boys Basel|Old Boys]], Basel were allocated to the East group. The other teams in that group were  [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshopper Club]], [[FC Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], [[SC Young Fellows Juventus|Young Fellows Z\u00fcrich]], [[FC Winterthur|Winterthur]] and [[FC St. Gallen|St. Gallen]].<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-1907-08\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?saison=1907/08 | title = Games 1907-08 East Group | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2018-11-16}}</ref>  The group was an evenly balanced group and at the end of the season the teams from second to eighth position were only separated by six points. Only Winterthur had a good run of results and were able to move clear at the top of the league table, winning the group with a six point advantage. \n\nThus Winterthur qualified for the league final, which was held in [[Basel]] on 31 May 1908. Winterthur won the Swiss Championship title beating [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]] by four goals to one.<ref name=\"rsssf 1908\">{{cite web | first = Erik | last = Garin | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwithist-reg.html#1908 | title = Switzerland 1908 | format = | work = | publisher = rsssf.com | accessdate = 2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nAlso a mention for chairman [[Siegfried Pfeiffer]], during his presidential term he played one game for the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss national team]].

This was the beginning of the [[Informbiro period]], marked by poor relations with the USSR, that came to an end in 1955.\n\n==Views==\nThe split was said by the Soviets to be caused by Yugoslavia's disloyalty to the USSR, while in Yugoslavia and the West it was presented as [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s national pride and refusal to submit to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s will in making Yugoslavia a Soviet [[satellite state]].  The scholar Perovi\u0107 considered the cause to be Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in cooperation with the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern European bloc outside Moscow's control which would be known as the [[Balkan Federation]].<ref name=\"auto\">Jeronim Perovic, \"The Tito\u2013Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence.\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (Spring 2007) 9#2 pp: 32-63</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. The occupying powers were opposed by several resistance groups; the communist resistance, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], was the largest and took control of the country by 1945, with minimal Soviet intervention. At this point, Tito was loyal to Moscow.\n\nTito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia would get more room to follow its own interests than other [[Eastern Bloc]] leaders who had more reason (and came under more pressure) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. This had already led to some friction between the two countries before World War II was even over. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, resulting in an uneasy alliance.<ref>Richard West, ''Tito'' (1994)</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc]] occurred. Following the war, Yugoslavia successfully captured the territory of [[Istria]], as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]] that had formed part of Italy from the 1920s. This move was of direct benefit to the Slavic populations of the regions (i.e. mainly [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]]). Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies and by Stalin. This led to several armed incidents, notably Yugoslav fighter planes shooting down American transport aircraft, causing angry criticism from the West and from Stalin. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.<ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/yugoslavia/airforce/victories/ Air victories of Yugoslav Air Force<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt that the USSR was unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II.\n\nIn addition, Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] not to support communism there with the [[Percentages agreement]]. Tito planned to absorb Albania and Greece in cooperation with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern Europe bloc outside Moscow's control. Stalin could not tolerate that threat.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== First Cominform ==\nHowever, the world still saw the two countries as the closest of allies. This was evident at the first meeting of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, where the Yugoslav representatives were the most strident critics of the national communist parties viewed to be insufficiently devoted to the cause, specifically the Italian and French parties for engaging in coalition politics. They were thereby essentially arguing Soviet positions. The headquarters for Cominform were even set up in [[Belgrade]]. However, all was not well between the two countries, due to a number of disputes.\n\n== Trip to Moscow ==\nThe friction that led to the ultimate split had many causes, many of which can ultimately be linked to Tito's regional focus and his refusal to accept Moscow as the supreme communist authority.

This was the beginning of the [[Informbiro period]], marked by poor relations with the USSR, that came to an end in 1955.\n\n==Views==\nThe split was said by the Soviets to be caused by Yugoslavia's disloyalty to the USSR, while in Yugoslavia and the West it was presented as [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s national pride and refusal to submit to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s will in making Yugoslavia a Soviet [[satellite state]].  The scholar Perovi\u0107 considered the cause to be Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in cooperation with the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern European bloc outside Moscow's control which would be known as the [[Balkan Federation]].<ref name=\"auto\">Jeronim Perovic, \"The Tito\u2013Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence.\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (Spring 2007) 9#2 pp: 32-63</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. The occupying powers were opposed by several resistance groups; the communist resistance, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], was the largest and took control of the country by 1945, with minimal Soviet intervention. At this point, Tito was loyal to Moscow.\n\nTito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia would get more room to follow its own interests than other [[Eastern Bloc]] leaders who had more reason (and came under more pressure) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. This had already led to some friction between the two countries before World War II was even over. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, resulting in an uneasy alliance.<ref>Richard West, ''Tito'' (1994)</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc]] occured. Following the war, Yugoslavia successfully captured the territory of [[Istria]], as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]] that had formed part of Italy from the 1920s. This move was of direct benefit to the Slavic populations of the regions (i.e. mainly [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]]). Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies and by Stalin. This led to several armed incidents, notably Yugoslav fighter planes shooting down American transport aircraft, causing angry criticism from the West and from Stalin. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.<ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/yugoslavia/airforce/victories/ Air victories of Yugoslav Air Force<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt that the USSR was unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II.\n\nIn addition, Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] not to support communism there with the [[Percentages agreement]]. Tito planned to absorb Albania and Greece in cooperation with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], thereby setting up a powerful Eastern Europe bloc outside Moscow's control. Stalin could not tolerate that threat.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== First Cominform ==\nHowever, the world still saw the two countries as the closest of allies. This was evident at the first meeting of the [[Cominform]] in 1947, where the Yugoslav representatives were the most strident critics of the national communist parties viewed to be insufficiently devoted to the cause, specifically the Italian and French parties for engaging in coalition politics. They were thereby essentially arguing Soviet positions. The headquarters for Cominform were even set up in [[Belgrade]]. However, all was not well between the two countries, due to a number of disputes.\n\n== Trip to Moscow ==\nThe friction that led to the ultimate split had many causes, many of which can ultimately be linked to Tito's regional focus and his refusal to accept Moscow as the supreme communist authority. The Yugoslavs were of the opinion that the joint-stock companies favored in the Soviet Union were not effective in Yugoslavia. In addition, Tito's deployment of troops in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] to prevent the civil conflict in Greece from spreading into neighbouring countries (including Yugoslavia), carried out without consulting the Soviets, had greatly angered Stalin.\n\nStalin was also enraged by Tito's aspirations to merge Yugoslavia with Bulgaria (and therefore create a true \"Land of the South Slavs\"), an idea with which he agreed in theory, but which had also taken place without prior Soviet consultation.<ref>Perovic, \"The Tito\u2013Stalin Split: A Reassessment in Light of New Evidence.\"</ref>   He summoned two of Tito's officials, [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]], to Moscow to discuss these matters. As a result of these talks, \u0110ilas and Kardelj became convinced that Yugoslav-Soviet relations had already reached an impasse.\n\n== Letter exchange ==\nBetween the trip to Moscow and the second meeting of the Cominform, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist Party]] (CPY) exchanged a series of letters detailing their grievances.

In more recent years he has focused mainly on political commentary, sometimes replacing or supplementing his simple drawings with reproduced photographic images with [[speech balloon]]s attached. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] has also provided airtime to Leunig to discuss his views on a range of political and philosophical issues.\n\n== Cartoons ==\nLeunig's drawings are done with a sparse and quivering line, usually in black and white with [[ink|ink wash]]; the human characters are always drawn with exaggerated noses. This style served him well in his early years, when he gained a loyal following for his quirky take on social issues. He also made increasingly frequent forays into a personal fantasy world of whimsy, featuring small figures with teapots balanced on their heads, grotesquely curled hair and many ducks.\n\nLeunig has frequently satirised concepts such as [[Americanisation]], [[greed]], [[consumerism]], [[corporation]]s and [[wikt:warmonger|warmonger]]ing, in a personal proclamation against the [[War on Terror]]. Readers and critics took special note of his parodies of political matters, especially those concerning former Australian prime minister [[John Howard]] and former American president [[George W. Bush]]. These have earned Leunig a description as a \"political cartoonist\",<ref name=\"wsws\">{{cite web|title=Zionists witch-hunt Australia's leading cartoonist|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/02/leun-f23.html|work=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Richard Phillips|date=23 February 2006}}</ref> although only some of his works are political in nature or reference.\n\nHis work has also frequently explored spiritual, religious and moral themes.\n\n=== Controversial works ===\n[[File:Michael Leunig.jpg|thumb|Leunig speaks at a demonstration in [[Melbourne]] against [[2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Israel's military action in Gaza]], 2009]]\n\nLeunig's cartoons have occasionally been a source of controversy.

Three of his 2004\u20132006 cartoons drew letters of protest nationally and internationally in relation to this.

In more recent years he has focused mainly on political commentary, sometimes replacing or supplementing his simple drawings with reproduced photographic images with [[speech balloon]]s attached. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] has also provided airtime to Leunig to discuss his views on a range of political and philosophical issues.\n\n== Cartoons ==\nLeunig's drawings are done with a sparse and quivering line, usually in black and white with [[ink|ink wash]]; the human characters are always drawn with exaggerated noses. This style served him well in his early years, when he gained a loyal following for his quirky take on social issues. He also made increasingly frequent forays into a personal fantasy world of whimsy, featuring small figures with teapots balanced on their heads, grotesquely curled hair and many ducks.\n\nLeunig has frequently satirised concepts such as [[Americanisation]], [[greed]], [[consumerism]], [[corporation]]s and [[wikt:warmonger|warmonger]]ing, in a personal proclamation against the [[War on Terror]]. Readers and critics took special note of his parodies of political matters, especially those concerning former Australian prime minister [[John Howard]] and former American president [[George W.

Three of his 2004\u20132006 cartoons drew letters of protest nationally and internationally in relation to this. The three pieces took as their subjects: [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] bomber pilots (13 April 2004); [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]]'s assassination order from [[Ariel Sharon]] (11 January 2006); and the renewed [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Gaza occupation]] (12 July 2006). A fourth piece was refused publication and has since been more widely criticised for potentially confounding his opposition to the policies of Israel with an antisemitic, generalised subversion of the Jewish experience, by relying upon a reference to the [[Jewish Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} This cartoon came to international attention after it was entered in an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition|Iranian competition]] conceived by the newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' as retaliation for the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons controversy]].
