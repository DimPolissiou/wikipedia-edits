His force of 25,000 men held Motien Pass, in the middle of [[Liaodong Peninsula]], on the main road between Antung (modern [[Dandong]], China) and [[Liaoyang]]. Keller, a loyal friend of General [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]] and a student of General [[Mikhail Skobelev]], observed that the Japanese strategy was similar to that of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (i.e. that the three Japanese armies would converge on Haicheng, as they had 10 years previously). Kuropatin agreed, and in an effort to fortify his position at Haicheng, he began a series of complex and confusing troop movements as he endeavored to plug real or imaginary gaps in his defensive line. Keller, already weakened by the loss of men at the [[Battle of Te-li-Ssu]], was further forced to give up two more [[regiment]]s to Kuropatin's defenses at Haicheng.\n\nThe [[First Army (Japan)|Japanese 1st Army]], under command of General [[Kuroki Tamemoto]], paused at Fenghaungshang (modern Fengheng, [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]]) from 2\u20138 July to await supplies and reinforcements. Kuroki decided to attack on 9 July, which was, by coincidence, the same day that General Keller received orders from General Kuropatkin depriving him of yet another regiment to support the defenses of Haicheng.\n\nGuarding the strategic Motien Pass, the Russians had three [[infantry]] regiments, three [[artillery]] batteries and a [[Cossack]] regiment. To the west was the reserve infantry regiment supported by a Cossack brigade. During the night of 8\u20139 July, a Japanese force moved along an unguarded path to the rear of the Russian right flank. This force was supported by [[Maxim gun|Maxim machine guns]] and mountain artillery. Another group, clad in Japanese straw sandals to mask their movements, moved around the Russian left flank undetected.\n\n==Battle==\nThe battle began at 05:15 on 10 July with a direct Japanese frontal attack. This attack faltered by 07:00 due to strong artillery fire from the Russian positions; however, by 08:00, the Russians found themselves all but encircled by the Japanese flanking attack. By 10:00, the Russians were in full retreat towards Hsimucheng (modern Ximu, Liaodong Province, China).\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Japanese moved in to occupy Motien Pass on 13 July. Casualties on both sides were relatively light, and later commentators have speculated extensively on why General Keller (otherwise known to be competent) abandoned such a strategic and easily  defendable location with so little resistance. Keller, who perished due to [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] wounds from Japanese artillery in an ill-fated counterattack to retake Motien Pass, left no notes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[[Rotem Kowner|Kowner, Rotem]] (2006).

Carter, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], took office after defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]]. His presidency ended with his defeat in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] by Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nCarter took office during a period of \"[[stagflation]]\", as the economy experienced a combination of high [[inflation]] and slow economic growth. His budgetary policies centered on taming inflation by reducing deficits and government spending. Responding to energy concerns that had persisted through much of the 1970s, his administration enacted a national energy policy designed to promote energy conservation and the development of alternative resources. Despite Carter's policies, the country was beset by an [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]] in 1979, which was followed by a [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|recession]] in 1980. Carter sought reforms to the country's welfare, health care, and tax systems, but was largely unsuccessful, partly due to poor relations with Congress.\n\nTaking office in the midst of the [[Cold War]], Carter reoriented U.S. foreign policy towards an emphasis on [[human rights]]. He continued the conciliatory Cold War policies of his predecessors, normalizing relations with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and pursuing further [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. In an effort to end the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]], he helped arrange the [[Camp David Accords]] between Israel and Egypt. Through the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]], Carter guaranteed the eventual transfer of the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Panama]]. After the start of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], he discarded his conciliatory policies towards the Soviet Union and began a period of military build-up.\n\nThe final fifteen months of Carter's presidential tenure were marked by several major crises, including the [[Iran hostage crisis]], serious fuel shortages, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [[Ted Kennedy]], a prominent liberal Democrat who protested Carter's opposition to a [[national health insurance]] system, challenged Carter in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic primaries]]. Boosted by public support for his policies in late 1979 and early 1980, Carter rallied to defeat Kennedy and win re-nomination. In the general election, Carter faced Reagan, a conservative former governor of California. Though polls taken on the eve of the election showed a close race, Reagan won a decisive victory. In [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|polls of historians and political scientists]], Carter is usually ranked as a below-average president.\n\n==Presidential election of 1976==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1976}}\n[[File:Carter and Ford in a debate, September 23, 1976.jpg|right|thumb|Carter and President [[Gerald Ford]] debating at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n\nCarter was elected as the [[Governor of Georgia]] in 1970, and during his four years in office he earned a reputation as a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]], racially moderate [[Southern United States|Southern]] governor.

At the time, domestic oil prices were not set by the world market, but rather by the complex [[price control]]s of the 1975 [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] (EPCA). Oil companies strongly favored the deregulation of prices, since it would increase their profits, but some members of Congress worried that deregulation would contribute to inflation. In late April and early May the [[Gallup poll]] found only 14 percent of the public believed that America was in an actual energy shortage. The other 77 percent believed that this was brought on by oil companies just to make a profit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Kenneth |title=Jimmy Carter American Moralist |date=1996 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |location=Athens & London |isbn=0820318620 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/jimmycarterameri00morr/page/261 261] |edition=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/jimmycarterameri00morr/page/261 }}</ref> Carter paired the deregulation proposal with a [[windfall profits tax]], which would return about half of the new profits of the oil companies to the federal government.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, relations between the two [[superpower]]s had improved through a policy known as [[detente]]. In a reflection of the waning importance of the Cold War, some of Carter's contemporaries labeled him as the first post-Cold War president, but relations with the Soviet Union would continue to be an important factor in American foreign policy in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Many of the leading officials in the Carter administration, including Carter himself, were members of the Trilateral Commission, which de-emphasized the Cold War. The Trilateral Commission instead advocated a foreign policy focused on aid to [[Third World]] countries and improved relations with Western Europe and Japan. The central tension of the Carter administration's foreign policy was reflected in the division between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who sought improved relations with the Soviet Union and the Third World, and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who favored confrontation with the Soviet Union on a range of issues.<ref>Herring, pp. 830\u2013833</ref>\n\n====Human rights====\n[[File:Nlc02585cs.jpg|thumb|Carter meeting with Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], in Washington, D.C., September 6, 1977]]\n\nCarter believed that previous administrations had erred in allowing the Cold War concerns and [[Realpolitik]] to dominate foreign policy. His administration placed a new emphasis on [[human rights]], [[democratic values]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and global poverty.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 44\u201346</ref> The Carter administration's human rights emphasis was part of a broader, worldwide focus on human rights in the 1970s, as [[non-governmental organization]]s such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] became increasingly prominent. Carter nominated [[civil rights]] activist [[Patricia M. Derian]] as Coordinator for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, and in August 1977, had the post elevated to that of [[Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State]]. Derian established the [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]], published annually since 1977.<ref>Herring, pp. 845\u2013846</ref> [[Latin America]] was central to Carter's new focus on human rights.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 46\u201347</ref> The Carter administration ended support to the historically U.S.-backed [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Somoza]] regime in Nicaragua and directed aid to the new [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] government that assumed power after Somoza's overthrow. Carter also cut back or terminated military aid to [[Augusto Pinochet]] of [[Chile]], [[Ernesto Geisel]] of Brazil, and [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] of Argentina, all of whom he criticized for human rights violations.<ref>Herring, pp. 846\u2013847</ref>\n\nCarter's ambassador to the [[United Nations]], [[Andrew Young]], was the first African-American to hold a high-level diplomatic post.

Sadat's visit drew the condemnation of other [[Arab League]] countries, but Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] each expressed an openness to bilateral talks. Begin sought security guarantees; Sadat sought the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and home rule for the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], Israeli-occupied territories that were largely populated by [[Palestinians|Palestinian Arabs]]. Israel had taken control of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], while the Sinai had been occupied by Israel since the end of the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\nSeeking to further negotiations, Carter invited Begin and Sadat to the presidential retreat of [[Camp David]] in September 1978.

Israel had begun constructing [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] in the West Bank, which emerged as an important barrier to a peace agreement. Unable to come to definitive settlement over an Israeli withdrawal, the two sides reached an agreement in which Israel made vague promises to allow the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. In return, Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel's right to exist.

That same year, rioting broke out in several cities, and it soon spread across the country. Poor economic conditions, the unpopularity of Pahlavi's \"[[White Revolution]]\", and an [[Islamic revival]] all led to increasing anger among Iranians, many of whom also despised the United States for its support of Pahlavi and its role in the 1953 coup.<ref name=\"herring847848\">Herring, pp. 847\u2013848</ref>\n\nBy 1978, the [[Iranian Revolution]] had broken out against the Shah's rule.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, p. 155</ref> Secretary of State Vance argued that the Shah should institute a series of reforms to appease the voices of discontent, while Brzezinski argued in favor of a crackdown on dissent.

A popular religious figure, Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini's return to Iran|returned from exile]] in February 1979 to popular acclaim.

He refused the Iranian demand of the return of Pahlavi in exchange for the release of the hostages. His approval ratings rose as Americans rallied around his response, but the crisis became increasingly problematic for his administration as it continued.<ref>Herring, p. 850</ref> In an attempt to rescue the hostages, Carter launched [[Operation Eagle Claw]] in April 1980. The operation was a total disaster, and it ended in the death of eight American soldiers. The failure of the operation strengthened Ayatollah Khomenei's position in Iran and badly damaged Carter's domestic standing.<ref>Herring, pp. 858\u2013859</ref> Carter was dealt another blow when Vance, who had consistently opposed the operation, resigned.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Iran refused to negotiate the return of the hostages until [[Iraq]] [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|launched an invasion]] in September 1980 With [[Algeria]] serving as an intermediary, negotiations continued until an agreement was reached in January 1981.

Carter made the cession of the Panama Canal a priority, believing it would implement Carter's call for a moral cleaning of American foreign policy and win approval across Latin America as a gracious apology for American wrongdoing. He also feared that another postponement of negotiations might precipitate violent upheaval in Panama, which could be damaged or block the canal.<ref>Gaddis Smith, ''Morality Reason, and Power: American Diplomacy in the Carter Years'' (1986) pp 111-15.</ref>\n\nThe Carter administration negotiated the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]], two treaties which provided that Panama would gain control of the canal in 1999. Carter's initiative faced wide resistance in the United States, and many in the public, particularly conservatives, thought that Carter was \"giving away\" a crucial U.S. asset.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 69-70</ref> Conservatives formed groups such as the Committee to Save the Panama Canal in an attempt to defeat the treaties in the Senate, but Carter made ratification of the treaties his top priority.

In early 1980, Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] announced that anyone who wished to leave Cuba would be allowed to do so through the port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]. After Carter announced that the United States would provide \"open arms for the tens of thousands of refugees seeking freedom from Communist domination\", [[Cuban Americans]] arranged the [[Mariel boatlift]]. The [[Refugee Act]], signed earlier in the year, had provided for annual cap of 19,500 Cuban immigrants to the United States per year, and required that those refugees go through a review process. By September, 125,000 Cubans had arrived in the United States, and many faced a lack of inadequate food and housing. Carter was widely criticized for his handling of the boatlift, especially in the electorally important state of Florida.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 227\u2013228</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n====Rapprochement with China====\n{{See also|Sino-American relations}}\n\n[[File:Carter DengXiaoping (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]] with President Carter]]\n\nContinuing a rapprochement begun during the Nixon administration, Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC). The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the [[Sino-Vietnamese War|Chinese invasion]] of [[Vietnam]]. In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>Herring, pp. 839\u2013840</ref> After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.<ref>Herring, pp. 855\u2013856</ref> In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which had lost control of [[mainland China]] to the PRC in the [[Chinese Civil War]], but retained control the island of [[Taiwan]]. Carter's abrogation of the treaty was challenged in court by conservative Republicans, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable [[political question]] in ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]''. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 [[Taiwan Relations Act]].<ref name=\"millerforeign\">{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Robert A.|title=Jimmy Carter: Foreign Affairs\n|url=https://millercenter.org/president/carter/foreign-affairs|website=Miller Center|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====South Korea====\n\nOne of Carter's first acts was to order the withdrawal of troops from South Korea, which had hosted a large number of U.S. military personnel since the end of the [[Korean War]]. Carter believed that the soldiers could be put to better use in Western Europe, but opponents of the withdrawal feared that North Korea would invade South Korea in the aftermath of the withdrawal. South Korea and Japan both protested the move, as did many members of Congress, the military, and the State Department. After a strong backlash, Carter delayed the withdrawal, and ultimately only a fraction of the U.S. forces left South Korea.

Strong writes:\n\n<blockquote>Jimmy Carter is much more highly regarded today than when he lost his bid for reelection in 1980. He has produced an exemplary post-presidency, and today there is an increased appreciation for the enormity of the task he took on in 1977, if not for the measures he took to deal with the crises that he faced. Carter took office just thirty months after a President had left the entire federal government in a shambles. He faced epic challenges\u2014the energy crisis, Soviet aggression, Iran, and above all, a deep mistrust of leadership by his citizens. He was hard working and conscientious. But he often seemed like a player out of position, a man more suited to be secretary of energy than president. Carter became President by narrowly defeating an uninspiring, unelected chief executive heir to the worst presidential scandal in history. The nomination was his largely because in the decade before 1976, Democratic leadership in the nation had been decimated by scandal, Vietnam, and an assassination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Robert A.|title=JIMMY CARTER: IMPACT AND LEGACY|url=https://millercenter.org/president/carter/impact-and-legacy|website=Miller Center|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian Burton I. Kaufman and Scott Kaufman write:\n\n<blockquote>It was Carter's fate to attempt to navigate the nation between the rock of traditional Democratic constituencies and the hard place of an emerging conservative movement whose emphasis was more on social and cultural values than on the economic concerns of the Democratic Party. It was also Carter's misfortune that he led the nation at a time of staggering inflation and growing unemployment, compounded by an oil shock over which he had little control... At the same time, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Carter's was a mediocre presidency and that this was largely his own doing. He was smart rather than shrewd. He was not a careful political planner. He suffered from strategic myopia. He was long on good intentions but short on know-how. He had lofty ideals, such as in the area of human rights, which had symbolic and long-lasting importance, but they often blinded him to political realities. He was self-righteous.

Carter, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], took office after defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]]. His presidency ended with his defeat in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] by Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nCarter took office during a period of \"[[stagflation]]\", as the economy experienced a combination of high [[inflation]] and slow economic growth. His budgetary policies centered on taming inflation by reducing deficits and government spending. Responding to energy concerns that had persisted through much of the 1970s, his administration enacted a national energy policy designed to promote energy conservation and the development of alternative resources. Despite Carter's policies, the country was beset by an [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]] in 1979, which was followed by a [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|recession]] in 1980. Carter sought reforms to the country's welfare, health care, and tax systems, but was largely unsuccessful, partly due to poor relations with Congress.\n\nTaking office in the midst of the [[Cold War]], Carter reoriented U.S. foreign policy towards an emphasis on [[human rights]]. He continued the conciliatory Cold War policies of his predecessors, normalizing relations with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and pursuing further [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. In an effort to end the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]], he helped arrange the [[Camp David Accords]] between Israel and Egypt. Through the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]], Carter guaranteed the eventual transfer of the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Panama]]. After the start of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], he discarded his conciliatory policies towards the Soviet Union and began a period of military build-up.\n\nThe final fifteen months of Carter's presidential tenure were marked by several major crises, including the [[Iran hostage crisis]], serious fuel shortages, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [[Ted Kennedy]], a prominent liberal Democrat who protested Carter's opposition to a [[national health insurance]] system, challenged Carter in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic primaries]]. Boosted by public support for his policies in late 1979 and early 1980, Carter rallied to defeat Kennedy and win re-nomination. In the general election, Carter faced Reagan, a conservative former governor of California. Though polls taken on the eve of the election showed a close race, Reagan won a decisive victory. In [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|polls of historians and political scientists]], Carter is usually ranked as a below-average president.\n\n==Presidential election of 1976==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1976}}\n[[File:Carter and Ford in a debate, September 23, 1976.jpg|right|thumb|Carter and President [[Gerald Ford]] debating at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n\nCarter was elected as the [[Governor of Georgia]] in 1970, and during his four years in office he earned a reputation as a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]], racially moderate [[Southern United States|Southern]] governor.

The limited spending involved in the package reflected Carter's fiscal conservatism, as he was more concerned with avoiding inflation and balancing the budget than addressing unemployment. Carter's resistance to higher federal spending drew attacks from many members of his own party, who wanted to lower the unemployment rate through federal public works projects. Carter signed several measures designed to address unemployment in 1977, including an extension of the [[Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]], but he continued to focus primarily on reducing deficits and inflation.

Negotiations with Congress dragged on into 1978, but Carter signed the [[National Energy Act]] in November 1978. Many of Carter's original proposals were not included in the legislation, but the act deregulated natural gas and encouraged energy conservation and the development of [[renewable energy]] through tax credits.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp.  pp. 38, 70-71, 85\u201387, 129\u2013131</ref>\n\n====1979 energy crisis====\n{{See also|1979 energy crisis}}\n\nAnother energy shortage hit the United States in 1979, forcing millions of frustrated motorists into long waits at gasoline stations. In response, Carter asked Congress to deregulate the price of domestic oil. At the time, domestic oil prices were not set by the world market, but rather by the complex [[price control]]s of the 1975 [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] (EPCA). Oil companies strongly favored the deregulation of prices, since it would increase their profits, but some members of Congress worried that deregulation would contribute to inflation. In late April and early May the [[Gallup poll]] found only 14 percent of the public believed that America was in an actual energy shortage.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, relations between the two [[superpower]]s had improved through a policy known as [[detente]]. In a reflection of the waning importance of the Cold War, some of Carter's contemporaries labeled him as the first post-Cold War president, but relations with the Soviet Union would continue to be an important factor in American foreign policy in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Many of the leading officials in the Carter administration, including Carter himself, were members of the Trilateral Commission, which de-emphasized the Cold War. The Trilateral Commission instead advocated a foreign policy focused on aid to [[Third World]] countries and improved relations with Western Europe and Japan. The central tension of the Carter administration's foreign policy was reflected in the division between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who sought improved relations with the Soviet Union and the Third World, and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who favored confrontation with the Soviet Union on a range of issues.<ref>Herring, pp. 830\u2013833</ref>\n\n====Human rights====\n[[File:Nlc02585cs.jpg|thumb|Carter meeting with Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], in Washington, D.C., September 6, 1977]]\n\nCarter believed that previous administrations had erred in allowing the Cold War concerns and [[Realpolitik]] to dominate foreign policy.

Carter nominated [[civil rights]] activist [[Patricia M. Derian]] as Coordinator for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, and in August 1977, had the post elevated to that of [[Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State]].

Sadat's visit drew the condemnation of other [[Arab League]] countries, but Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] each expressed an openness to bilateral talks. Begin sought security guarantees; Sadat sought the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and home rule for the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], Israeli-occupied territories that were largely populated by [[Palestinians|Palestinian Arabs]]. Israel had taken control of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], while the Sinai had been occupied by Israel since the end of the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\nSeeking to further negotiations, Carter invited Begin and Sadat to the presidential retreat of [[Camp David]] in September 1978. Because direct negotiations between Sadat and Begin proved unproductive, Carter began meeting with the two leaders individually.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 150\u2013151</ref> While Begin was willing to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, he refused to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel had begun constructing [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] in the West Bank, which emerged as an important barrier to a peace agreement. Unable to come to definitive settlement over an Israeli withdrawal, the two sides reached an agreement in which Israel made vague promises to allow the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. In return, Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel's right to exist. The [[Camp David Accords]] were the subject of intense domestic opposition in both Egypt and Israel, as well as the wider [[Arab World]], but each side agreed to negotiate a peace treaty on the basis of the accords.<ref name=\"auto\">Herring, pp. 841\u2013842</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Bickerton, I pages 190\">Bickerton and Klausner, pp. 190\u2013193; 198\u2013200.</ref> Carter's role in getting the treaty was essential.

Sullivan]], Cyrus Vance, President Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski in Tehran, 1977]]\n\n[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the [[Shah of Iran|Shah]] of [[Iran]], had been a reliable U.S. ally since the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. During the years after the coup, the U.S. lavished aid on Iran, while Iran served as a dependable source of oil exports.<ref name=\"herring847848\"/> Carter, Vance, and Brzezinski all viewed Iran as a key Cold War ally, not only for the oil it produced but also because of its influence in OPEC and its strategic position between the Soviet Union and the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, p. 156</ref> Despite human rights violations, Carter visited Iran in late 1977 and authorized the sale of U.S. fighter aircraft. That same year, rioting broke out in several cities, and it soon spread across the country. Poor economic conditions, the unpopularity of Pahlavi's \"[[White Revolution]]\", and an [[Islamic revival]] all led to increasing anger among Iranians, many of whom also despised the United States for its support of Pahlavi and its role in the 1953 coup.<ref name=\"herring847848\">Herring, pp. 847\u2013848</ref>\n\nBy 1978, the [[Iranian Revolution]] had broken out against the Shah's rule.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, p. 155</ref> Secretary of State Vance argued that the Shah should institute a series of reforms to appease the voices of discontent, while Brzezinski argued in favor of a crackdown on dissent. The mixed messages that the Shah received from Vance and Brzezinski contributed to his confusion and indecision. The Shah went into exile, leaving a caretaker government in control. A popular religious figure, Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini's return to Iran|returned from exile]] in February 1979 to popular acclaim. As the unrest continued, Carter allowed Pahlavi into the United States for medical treatment.<ref name=\"herring848850\"/> Carter and Vance were both initially reluctant to admit Pahlavi due to concerns about the reaction in Iran, but Iranian leaders assured them that it would not cause an issue.<ref name=\"kaufman193194\">Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 193\u2013194</ref> In November 1979, shortly after Pahlavi was allowed to enter the U.S., a group of Iranians stormed the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. embassy]] in [[Tehran]] and took 66 American captives, beginning the [[Iran hostage crisis]].<ref name=\"herring848850\">Herring, pp. 848\u2013850</ref> Iranian Prime Minister [[Mehdi Bazargan]] ordered the militants to release the hostages, but he resigned from office after Khomeini backed the militants.<ref name=\"kaufman193194\"/>\n\nThe crisis quickly became the subject of international and domestic attention, and Carter vowed to secure the release of the hostages. He refused the Iranian demand of the return of Pahlavi in exchange for the release of the hostages. His approval ratings rose as Americans rallied around his response, but the crisis became increasingly problematic for his administration as it continued.<ref>Herring, p. 850</ref> In an attempt to rescue the hostages, Carter launched [[Operation Eagle Claw]] in April 1980. The operation was a total disaster, and it ended in the death of eight American soldiers. The failure of the operation strengthened Ayatollah Khomenei's position in Iran and badly damaged Carter's domestic standing.<ref>Herring, pp. 858\u2013859</ref> Carter was dealt another blow when Vance, who had consistently opposed the operation, resigned.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Iran refused to negotiate the return of the hostages until [[Iraq]] [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|launched an invasion]] in September 1980 With [[Algeria]] serving as an intermediary, negotiations continued until an agreement was reached in January 1981. In return for releasing the 52 captives, Iran accepted over $7 billion in monetary compensation and the unfreezing of Iranian assets in the United States. Iran waited to release the captives until hours after Carter left office on January 20, 1981.<ref>Patterson, pp. 125\u2013126</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\n====Panama Canal treaties====\n{{see also|Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties}}\n{{listen\n|filename=Carter Panama Canal speech.ogg\n|title=Statement on the Panama Canal Treaty Signing\n|description=Jimmy Carter's speech upon signing the Panama Canal treaty, September 7, 1977.\n}}\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos signing the Panama Canal Treaty.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0| Carter and [[Omar Torrijos]] shake hands moments after the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.]]\n\nSince the 1960s, Panama had called for the United States to cede control of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref>Robert A. Strong, \"Jimmy Carter and the Panama Canal Treaties.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (1991)  21.2: 269-286 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550717  online].</ref> The bipartisan national policy of turning over the Canal to Panama had been established by presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, but negotiations had dragged on for a dozen years. Carter made the cession of the Panama Canal a priority, believing it would implement Carter's call for a moral cleaning of American foreign policy and win approval across Latin America as a gracious apology for American wrongdoing. He also feared that another postponement of negotiations might precipitate violent upheaval in Panama, which could be damaged or block the canal.<ref>Gaddis Smith, ''Morality Reason, and Power: American Diplomacy in the Carter Years'' (1986) pp 111-15.</ref>\n\nThe Carter administration negotiated the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]], two treaties which provided that Panama would gain control of the canal in 1999. Carter's initiative faced wide resistance in the United States, and many in the public, particularly conservatives, thought that Carter was \"giving away\" a crucial U.S. asset.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 69-70</ref> Conservatives formed groups such as the Committee to Save the Panama Canal in an attempt to defeat the treaties in the Senate, but Carter made ratification of the treaties his top priority. During the ratification debate, the Senate crafted amendments that granted the U.S. the right to intervene militarily to keep the canal open, which the Panamanians assented to after further negotiations.<ref>Herring, pp. 837\u2013838</ref> In March 1978, the Senate ratified both treaties by a margin of 68-to-32, narrowly passing the two-thirds margin necessary for ratification.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 74-76</ref> The Canal Zone and all its facilities were ultimately turned over to Panama on December 31, 1999.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 69-76</ref><ref>Mary C.

[http://www.ebhsoc.org/journal/index.php/journal/article/download/86/82 online]</ref>\n\n====Cuba====\n\nCarter hoped to improve relations with [[Cuba]] upon taking office, but any thaw in relations was prevented by ongoing Cold War disputes in Central America and Africa. In early 1980, Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] announced that anyone who wished to leave Cuba would be allowed to do so through the port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]. After Carter announced that the United States would provide \"open arms for the tens of thousands of refugees seeking freedom from Communist domination\", [[Cuban Americans]] arranged the [[Mariel boatlift]]. The [[Refugee Act]], signed earlier in the year, had provided for annual cap of 19,500 Cuban immigrants to the United States per year, and required that those refugees go through a review process. By September, 125,000 Cubans had arrived in the United States, and many faced a lack of inadequate food and housing. Carter was widely criticized for his handling of the boatlift, especially in the electorally important state of Florida.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 227\u2013228</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n====Rapprochement with China====\n{{See also|Sino-American relations}}\n\n[[File:Carter DengXiaoping (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]] with President Carter]]\n\nContinuing a rapprochement begun during the Nixon administration, Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC). The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the [[Sino-Vietnamese War|Chinese invasion]] of [[Vietnam]]. In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>Herring, pp. 839\u2013840</ref> After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.<ref>Herring, pp. 855\u2013856</ref> In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which had lost control of [[mainland China]] to the PRC in the [[Chinese Civil War]], but retained control the island of [[Taiwan]]. Carter's abrogation of the treaty was challenged in court by conservative Republicans, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable [[political question]] in ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]''. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 [[Taiwan Relations Act]].<ref name=\"millerforeign\">{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Robert A.|title=Jimmy Carter: Foreign Affairs\n|url=https://millercenter.org/president/carter/foreign-affairs|website=Miller Center|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====South Korea====\n\nOne of Carter's first acts was to order the withdrawal of troops from South Korea, which had hosted a large number of U.S. military personnel since the end of the [[Korean War]]. Carter believed that the soldiers could be put to better use in Western Europe, but opponents of the withdrawal feared that North Korea would invade South Korea in the aftermath of the withdrawal. South Korea and Japan both protested the move, as did many members of Congress, the military, and the State Department. After a strong backlash, Carter delayed the withdrawal, and ultimately only a fraction of the U.S. forces left South Korea. Carter's attempt to remove U.S. forces from South Korea weakened the government of South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]], who was [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|assassinated]] in 1979.<ref>Herring, pp. 834\u2013835</ref>\n\n===Africa===\n\nIn sharp contrast to Nixon and Ford, Carter gave priority to sub-Sahara Africa.<ref>Gaddis Smith, ''Morality Reason, and Power: American Diplomacy in the Carter Years'' (1986) pp 133-56.</ref><ref>For highly detailed scholarly coverage see Nancy Mitchell, ''Jimmy Carter in Africa: Race and the Cold War'' (Stanford UP, 2016), 913pp.  [https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Africa-International-History-ebook/dp/B01FAN5UBA/  excerpt]</ref> [[Southern Africa]] especially emerged as a Cold War battleground after Cuba sent a large military force that took control of Angola in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The chief policy person for Africa in the Carter administration was Andrew Young, a leader in the black Atlanta community who became Ambassador to the United Nations.

Carter's polling numbers tumbled in March, and Kennedy won the New York and Connecticut primaries.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 208\u2013210</ref> Though Carter developed a wide delegate lead, Kennedy stayed in the race after triumphing in Pennsylvania and Michigan.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 210\u2013211</ref> By the day of the final primaries, Carter had registered the lowest approval ratings in the history of presidential polling, and Kennedy won just enough delegates to prevent Carter from clinching the nomination.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 217\u2013220</ref>\n\nAfter the final primaries, Carter met with Kennedy in the White House. Partly because Carter refused to accept a party platform calling for the establishment of a national health insurance program, Kennedy refused to concede. He instead called for an \"[[open convention]]\", in which delegates would be free to vote for the candidate of their choice regardless of the result in the primaries.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 220\u2013221</ref> Carter's allies defeated Kennedy's maneuverings at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]], and Carter and Vice President Mondale won re-nomination.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 232\u2013233</ref> Despite Kennedy's defeat, he had mobilized the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which would give Carter only weak support in the general election.<ref>{{cite book |author=Steven F.

W. Bush]] of Texas. Bush, who referred to Reagan's tax cut proposal as \"voodoo economics\", won the Iowa Caucus but faded later in the race. Reagan won the presidential nomination on the first ballot of the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] and named Bush as his running mate.<ref>Patterson, pp. 128\u2013129</ref> Meanwhile, Republican Congressman [[John B. Anderson]], who had previously sought the Republican presidential nomination, launched an independent campaign for president.<ref>Zelizer, p. 108</ref> Polls taken in September, after the conclusion of the party conventions, showed a tied race between Reagan and Carter.<ref>Zelizer, p. 115</ref> The Carter campaign felt confident that the country would reject the conservative viewpoints espoused by Reagan, and there were hopeful signs with regards to the economy and the Iranian hostage crisis.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 115-116</ref> Seeking to unite Democrats behind his re-election campaign, Carter decided to focus on attacking Reagan's supposed ideological extremism rather than on his own policies.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 235\u2013237</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1980.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The electoral map of the 1980 election]]\n\nA key strength for Reagan was his appeal to the rising conservative movement, as epitomized by activists like [[Paul Weyrich]], [[Richard Viguerie]], and [[Phyllis Schlafly]]. Though most conservative leaders espoused cutting taxes and budget deficits, many conservatives focused more closely on social issues like [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] and homosexuality.<ref>Patterson, pp. 130\u2013134</ref> Developments of the 1970s, including the Supreme Court case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and the withdrawal of [[Bob Jones University]]'s tax-exempt status, convinced many evangelical Protestants to become engaged in politics for the first time. Evangelical Protestants became an increasingly important voting bloc, and they generally supported Reagan in the 1980 campaign.<ref>Patterson, pp. 135\u2013141, 150</ref> Reagan also won the backing of so-called \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\", who tended to be Northern, white, working-class voters who supported liberal economic programs but disliked policies such as affirmative action.<ref>Patterson, p. 131</ref> Though he advocated socially conservative view points, Reagan focused much of his campaign on attacks against Carter's foreign policy, including the SALT II treaty, the Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties, and the revocation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty.<ref>Patterson, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> Reagan called for increased defense spending, tax cuts, domestic spending cuts, and the dismantling of the Department of Education and the Department of Energy.<ref>Patterson, p. 147</ref>\n\nPolling remained close throughout September and October, but Reagan's performance in the October 28 debate and Carter's failure to win the release of the Iranian hostages gave Reagan the momentum entering election day.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 122-124</ref> Reagan won 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 489 electoral votes, Carter won 41 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes, and Anderson won 6.6 percent of the popular vote.<ref>Zelizer, pp. 124-125</ref> Reagan carried all but a handful of states, and performed especially well among Southern whites.<ref name=\"patterson149151\"/> The size of Reagan's victory surprised many observers, who had expected a close race. Voter turnout reached its lowest point since the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]], a reflection of the negative attitudes many people held towards all three major candidates.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, p. 245\u2013246</ref> In the concurrent congressional elections, Republicans [[United States Senate elections, 1980|won control]] of the Senate for the first time since the 1950s.<ref name=\"patterson149151\">Patterson, pp. 149\u2013151</ref> Carter, meanwhile, was the first elected president to lose re-election since [[Herbert Hoover]] in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]].<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, p. 235</ref>\n\n==Evaluation and legacy==\n\nPolls of historians and political scientists have generally [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|ranked]] Carter as a below-average president.

Strong writes:\n\n<blockquote>Jimmy Carter is much more highly regarded today than when he lost his bid for reelection in 1980. He has produced an exemplary post-presidency, and today there is an increased appreciation for the enormity of the task he took on in 1977, if not for the measures he took to deal with the crises that he faced. Carter took office just thirty months after a President had left the entire federal government in a shambles. He faced epic challenges\u2014the energy crisis, Soviet aggression, Iran, and above all, a deep mistrust of leadership by his citizens. He was hard working and conscientious. But he often seemed like a player out of position, a man more suited to be secretary of energy than president. Carter became President by narrowly defeating an uninspiring, unelected chief executive heir to the worst presidential scandal in history. The nomination was his largely because in the decade before 1976, Democratic leadership in the nation had been decimated by scandal, Vietnam, and an assassination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Robert A.|title=JIMMY CARTER: IMPACT AND LEGACY|url=https://millercenter.org/president/carter/impact-and-legacy|website=Miller Center|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian Burton I. Kaufman and Scott Kaufman write:\n\n<blockquote>It was Carter's fate to attempt to navigate the nation between the rock of traditional Democratic constituencies and the hard place of an emerging conservative movement whose emphasis was more on social and cultural values than on the economic concerns of the Democratic Party. It was also Carter's misfortune that he led the nation at a time of staggering inflation and growing unemployment, compounded by an oil shock over which he had little control... At the same time, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Carter's was a mediocre presidency and that this was largely his own doing. He was smart rather than shrewd. He was not a careful political planner. He suffered from strategic myopia. He was long on good intentions but short on know-how. He had lofty ideals, such as in the area of human rights, which had symbolic and long-lasting importance, but they often blinded him to political realities. He was self-righteous. He was an administrator who micro-managed, but not well. Most important, he was a president who never adequately defined a mission for his government, a purpose for the country, and a way to get there.<ref>Kaufman and Kaufman, 2006, pp. 249\u2013250</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1964\u20131980)]]\n* [[Jimmy Carter rabbit incident]]\n* [[Sixth Party System]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1970\u20131989)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book |title=A history of the Arab-Israeli conflict |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofarabisr00bick |url-access=registration |last=Bickerton |first=Ian J. |authorlink= |author2=Carla L.

The Eucharistic celebration is seen as \"the source and summit\" of Christian living, the high point of God's sanctifying action on the faithful and of their worship of God, the point of contact between them and the liturgy of heaven. So important is it that participation in the Eucharistic celebration (see [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]) is seen as obligatory on every Sunday and [[holy day of obligation]] and is recommended on other days. Also recommended for those who participate in the Mass is reception, with the proper dispositions, of Holy Communion. This is seen as obligatory at least once a year, during Eastertide.\n\n=== Restored order of initiation ===\nDuring the second half of the 2010s some dioceses of Latin Rite in the United States, as elsewhere, returned to the original order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation, that is: Baptism, Confirmation and, lastly, first Communion.<ref name=\"OSV.com2015\" />\n\nThe ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' references this order at No. 1212, and at No. 1322 says: \"The holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation.\".\n\nAdministering the Eucharist before Confirmation began in the Latin Rite, unlike other rites, in consequence of [[Pope Pius X]]'s 1910 [[Decree (canon law)|decree]] ''[[Quam singulari|Quam singulari Christus amore]]'' (transl.: \"How special was Christ's love\"), which said Communion should not be delayed beyond when a child reaches the age of reason.

The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' mentions in the following order and capitalization different names of the sacrament, calling it the sacrament of conversion, Penance, confession, forgiveness and Reconciliation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P47.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1423-1424.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> It is the sacrament of spiritual healing of a baptized person from the distancing from God resulting from sins committed. When people sin after baptism, they cannot have baptism as a remedy; Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, cannot be given a second time.\n\nThe sacrament involves four elements:\n# Contrition (the penitent's sincere remorse for wrongdoing or sin, repentance, without which the rite has no effect);\n# Confession to a priest who has the faculty to hear confessions (Canon 966.1) \u2013 while it may be spiritually helpful to confess to another, only a priest has the power to administer the sacrament;\n# Absolution by the priest; and,\n# Satisfaction or penance.\n\n\"Many sins wrong our neighbour. One must do what is possible in order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries). Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must 'make satisfaction for' or 'expiate' his sins. This satisfaction is also called 'penance'\" (CCC 1459). In early Christian centuries, this element of satisfaction was quite onerous and generally preceded absolution, but now it usually involves a simple task for the penitent to perform later, in order to make some reparation and as a medicinal means of strengthening against further temptation.\n\nThe priest is bound by the \"[[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|seal of confession]]\", which is inviolable. \"Accordingly, it is absolutely wrong for a confessor in any way to betray the penitent, for any reason whatsoever, whether by word or in any other fashion.\"<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3F.HTM canon 983] of the Code of Canon Law</ref> A confessor who directly violates the sacramental seal incurs an automatic excommunication whose lifting is reserved to the [[Holy See]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P52.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law, 1388.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.intratext.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn some dioceses, certain sins are \"reserved\" which means only certain confessors can absolve them. Some sins, such as violation of the sacramental seal, consecration of bishops without authorization by the Holy See, direct physical attacks on the Pope, and intentional desecration of the Eucharist are reserved to the Holy See. A special case-by-case faculty from the [[Sacred Penitentiary]] is normally required to absolve these sins.\n\n=== Anointing of the Sick ===\n{{main|Anointing of the Sick in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Extreme Unction Rogier Van der Weyden.jpg|thumb|Extreme Unction, from [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s altarpiece]]\n[[Anointing of the Sick]] is the second sacrament of healing. In this sacrament a priest anoints the sick with oil blessed specifically for that purpose. \"The anointing of the sick can be administered to any member of the faithful who, having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger by reason of illness or old age\" (canon 1004; cf. CCC 1514). A new illness or a worsening of health enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time.\n\nWhen, in the Western Church, the sacrament was conferred only on those in ''immediate'' danger of death, it came to be known as \"[[Extreme Unction]]\", i.e. \"Final Anointing\", administered as one of the [[Last rites#In the Roman Catholic Church|Last Rites]]. The other Last Rites are Confession (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, at least absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), and the Eucharist, which when administered to the dying is known as \"bread for the journey\" or by the [[Latin]] name \"[[Viaticum]]\", literally \"provisions for a journey\".\n\n== Sacraments of service ==\n=== Holy Orders ===\n{{main|Bishop (Catholic Church)|Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Deacon#Roman_Catholicism|l3=Catholic Deacon}}\n\n[[Holy Orders]] is the Sacrament by which a layman is made a [[Deacon#Roman Catholicism|deacon]], a deacon is made a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and a priest is made a [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishop]], dedicated for service to the Church. In descending order of rank, the three degrees are referred to as episcopate, presbyterate and diaconate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=US Conference of Catholic Bishops|title=Compendium: Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=USCCB Publishing|isbn=978-1-57455-720-6|pages=93}}</ref> The bishop is the only minister of this sacrament. Ordination as a bishop confers the fullness of the sacrament, with membership of the [[College of Bishops]], the successor body in the Church to that of the [[Apostles]], and entrusting to him the [[threefold office]] to teach, sanctify, and govern the [[People of God]]. Ordination as a priest calls the priest to take, in the Eucharistic celebration, [[in persona Christi|the role of Christ]], the Head of the Church, the one essential High Priest, and confers on him the power and responsibility, as the bishop's assistant, to celebrate the sacraments except for Holy Orders. Ordination as a deacon configures the man in the service of the bishop, especially in the Church's exercise of Christian charity towards the poor, and preaching of the word of God.\n\nMen who discern a [[vocation]] to the priesthood are required by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] (canon 1032 of the Code of Canon Law) to undertake a [[seminary]] program with graduate level philosophical and theological studies and a formation program that includes [[spiritual direction]], [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], apostolate experience, and learning some Latin. The course of studies in preparation for ordination as a \"permanent\" deacon (one not intending to become a priest) is decided by the regional [[episcopal conference]].\n\n=== Matrimony ===\n{{main|Marriage in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Weyden Matrimony.jpg|thumb|upright|Matrimony, from Rogier Van der Weyden's altarpiece]]\n[[Christian views on marriage|Matrimony]], or Marriage, is another sacrament that consecrates for a particular mission in building up the Church, and that provides grace for accomplishing that mission. This sacrament, seen as a sign of the love uniting Christ and the Church, establishes between the spouses a permanent and exclusive bond, sealed by God. Accordingly, a marriage between [[Baptism|baptized]] people, validly entered into and consummated, cannot be dissolved. The sacrament confers on them the grace they need for attaining holiness in their married life and for responsible acceptance and upbringing of their children. As a condition for validity, the sacrament is celebrated in the presence of the local [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|Ordinary]] or [[priest|Parish Priest]] or of a cleric delegated by them (or in certain limited circumstances a lay person delegated by the diocesan Bishop with the approval of the [[Episcopal Conference]] and the permission of the [[Holy See]]) and at least two other witnesses,<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3Z.HTM canons 1108 and 1112] of the [[Code of Canon Law]]</ref> though in the theological tradition of the Latin Church the ministers of the sacrament uniquely are the couple themselves. For a valid marriage, a man and a woman must express their conscious and free consent to a definitive self-giving to the other, excluding none of the essential properties and aims of marriage. If one of the two is a non-Catholic Christian, their marriage is licit only if the permission of the competent authority of the Catholic Church is obtained. If one of the two is not a Christian (i.e. has not been [[baptism|baptized]]), the competent authority's dispensation is necessary for validity.\n\n==Validity and liceity==\n{{canon law}}\nAs stated above, the effect of the sacraments comes ''[[ex opere operato]]'' (by the very fact of being administered). Since it is Christ who works through them, their effectiveness does not depend on the worthiness of the minister.  The belief that the validity of the sacrament is dependent upon the holiness of the administrator was rejected in the [[Donatist]] crisis.\n\nHowever, an apparent administration of a sacrament is invalid if the person acting as minister does not have the necessary power (as if a deacon were to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]). They are also invalid if the required \"matter\" or \"form\" is lacking. The matter is the perceptible material object, such as water in baptism or bread and wine for the Eucharist, or the visible action. The form is the verbal statement that specifies the signification of the matter, such as, (in the Western Church), \"N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\". Furthermore, if the minister positively excludes some essential aspect of the sacrament, the sacrament is invalid. This last condition lies behind [[Apostolicae curae|the 1896 judgement of the Holy See]] denying the validity of [[Anglican Orders]], a judgment that, though questioned,<ref name=\"Lamb2017\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/7068/0/anglican-orders-not-invalid-says-cardinal-opening-way-for-revision-of-current-catholic-position-|title=Anglican Orders Not 'Invalid' Says Cardinal, Opening Way for Revision of Current Catholic Position|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|date=9 May 2017|work=The Tablet|access-date=12 July 2017|location=London}}</ref> is still upheld.\n\nA sacrament may be administered [[valid but illicit|validly, but illicitly]], if a condition imposed by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] is not observed. Obvious cases are administration of a sacrament by a priest under a penalty of excommunication or suspension, or an episcopal ordination without the Pontifical mandate (except in certain circumstances outlined in Canon Law).\n\n===Impediments===\n{{Main|Impediment (canon law)}}\n{{see also|Declaration of nullity}}\n[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] specifies [[impediment (canon law)|impediments]] to reception of the sacraments of orders and marriage. Some impediments are merely prohibitive and only concern liceity, but a diriment impediment renders invalid any attempt to confer the sacrament.\n\nIn the Latin Church, only the Holy See can authentically declare when divine law prohibits or invalidates a marriage, and only the Holy See has the right to establish for those who are baptised other impediments to marriage (canon 1075). But individual [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], after having fulfilled certain requirements that include consulting (but not necessarily obtaining approval from) the Holy See, may establish impediments.<ref>Canon 792, ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]''</ref>\n\nIf an impediment is imposed by merely ecclesiastical law, rather than being a matter of divine law, the Church may grant a dispensation from the impediment.\n\nConditions for validity of marriage such as sufficient use of reason (canon 1095) and freedom from coercion (canon 1103), and the requirement that, normally, a marriage be contracted in the presence of the local Ordinary or parish priest or of the priest or deacon delegated by either of them, and in the presence of two witnesses (canon 1108), are not classified in the Code of Canon Law as impediments, but have much the same effect.\n\n===Conditional conferral===\n{{See also|Conditional baptism}}\nThree of the sacraments may not be repeated: Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders: their effect is permanent. This teaching has been expressed by the images of, in the West, an indelible [[Sacramental character|character or mark]] and of, in the East, a seal (CCC 698). However, if there is doubt about the validity of the administration of one or more of these sacraments, a conditional form of conferral may be used, such as: \"If you are not already baptized, I baptize you \u2026\"<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J.], pp. 1057\u20131059.</ref>\n\nIn the recent past, it was common practice in the Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from [[Protestantism]] because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete instance. In the case of the major Protestant [[Christian denomination|denominations]], agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestant tradition. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=5 June 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> It does not recognize a baptismal ceremony in which the names of the three divine persons (or [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]) of the [[Trinity]]\u2014[[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]\u2014are replaced by descriptors such as [[Creator deity|Creator]], [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redeemer]] and [[Sanctifier]], or Creator, Liberator, and Sustainer, and requires that the conditional form should not be used when baptizing those who have received this kind of baptism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20080201_validity-baptism_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Catholicism}}\n* [[Thomistic sacramental theology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Raniero Cantalamessa]] OFMCap, ''Introduction'', in: ''Easter in the Early Church.

The Eucharistic celebration is seen as \"the source and summit\" of Christian living, the high point of God's sanctifying action on the faithful and of their worship of God, the point of contact between them and the liturgy of heaven. So important is it that participation in the Eucharistic celebration (see [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]) is seen as obligatory on every Sunday and [[holy day of obligation]] and is recommended on other days. Also recommended for those who participate in the Mass is reception, with the proper dispositions, of Holy Communion.

When people sin after baptism, they cannot have baptism as a remedy; Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, cannot be given a second time.\n\nThe sacrament involves four elements:\n# Contrition (the penitent's sincere remorse for wrongdoing or sin, repentance, without which the rite has no effect);\n# Confession to a priest who has the faculty to hear confessions (Canon 966.1) \u2013 while it may be spiritually helpful to confess to another, only a priest has the power to administer the sacrament;\n# Absolution by the priest; and,\n# Satisfaction or penance.\n\n\"Many sins wrong our neighbour. One must do what is possible in order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries). Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must 'make satisfaction for' or 'expiate' his sins. This satisfaction is also called 'penance'\" (CCC 1459). In early Christian centuries, this element of satisfaction was quite onerous and generally preceded absolution, but now it usually involves a simple task for the penitent to perform later, in order to make some reparation and as a medicinal means of strengthening against further temptation.\n\nThe priest is bound by the \"[[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|seal of confession]]\", which is inviolable. \"Accordingly, it is absolutely wrong for a confessor in any way to betray the penitent, for any reason whatsoever, whether by word or in any other fashion.\"<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3F.HTM canon 983] of the Code of Canon Law</ref> A confessor who directly violates the sacramental seal incurs an automatic excommunication whose lifting is reserved to the [[Holy See]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P52.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law, 1388.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.intratext.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn some dioceses, certain sins are \"reserved\" which means only certain confessors can absolve them. Some sins, such as violation of the sacramental seal, consecration of bishops without authorization by the Holy See, direct physical attacks on the Pope, and intentional desecration of the Eucharist are reserved to the Holy See. A special case-by-case faculty from the [[Sacred Penitentiary]] is normally required to absolve these sins.\n\n=== Anointing of the Sick ===\n{{main|Anointing of the Sick in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Extreme Unction Rogier Van der Weyden.jpg|thumb|Extreme Unction, from [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s altarpiece]]\n[[Anointing of the Sick]] is the second sacrament of healing. In this sacrament a priest anoints the sick with oil blessed specifically for that purpose. \"The anointing of the sick can be administered to any member of the faithful who, having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger by reason of illness or old age\" (canon 1004; cf. CCC 1514). A new illness or a worsening of health enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time.\n\nWhen, in the Western Church, the sacrament was conferred only on those in ''immediate'' danger of death, it came to be known as \"[[Extreme Unction]]\", i.e. \"Final Anointing\", administered as one of the [[Last rites#In the Roman Catholic Church|Last Rites]]. The other Last Rites are Confession (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, at least absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), and the Eucharist, which when administered to the dying is known as \"bread for the journey\" or by the [[Latin]] name \"[[Viaticum]]\", literally \"provisions for a journey\".\n\n== Sacraments of service ==\n=== Holy Orders ===\n{{main|Bishop (Catholic Church)|Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Deacon#Roman_Catholicism|l3=Catholic Deacon}}\n\n[[Holy Orders]] is the Sacrament by which a layman is made a [[Deacon#Roman Catholicism|deacon]], a deacon is made a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and a priest is made a [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishop]], dedicated for service to the Church. In descending order of rank, the three degrees are referred to as episcopate, presbyterate and diaconate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=US Conference of Catholic Bishops|title=Compendium: Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=USCCB Publishing|isbn=978-1-57455-720-6|pages=93}}</ref> The bishop is the only minister of this sacrament. Ordination as a bishop confers the fullness of the sacrament, with membership of the [[College of Bishops]], the successor body in the Church to that of the [[Apostles]], and entrusting to him the [[threefold office]] to teach, sanctify, and govern the [[People of God]]. Ordination as a priest calls the priest to take, in the Eucharistic celebration, [[in persona Christi|the role of Christ]], the Head of the Church, the one essential High Priest, and confers on him the power and responsibility, as the bishop's assistant, to celebrate the sacraments except for Holy Orders. Ordination as a deacon configures the man in the service of the bishop, especially in the Church's exercise of Christian charity towards the poor, and preaching of the word of God.\n\nMen who discern a [[vocation]] to the priesthood are required by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] (canon 1032 of the Code of Canon Law) to undertake a [[seminary]] program with graduate level philosophical and theological studies and a formation program that includes [[spiritual direction]], [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], apostolate experience, and learning some Latin. The course of studies in preparation for ordination as a \"permanent\" deacon (one not intending to become a priest) is decided by the regional [[episcopal conference]].\n\n=== Matrimony ===\n{{main|Marriage in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Weyden Matrimony.jpg|thumb|upright|Matrimony, from Rogier Van der Weyden's altarpiece]]\n[[Christian views on marriage|Matrimony]], or Marriage, is another sacrament that consecrates for a particular mission in building up the Church, and that provides grace for accomplishing that mission. This sacrament, seen as a sign of the love uniting Christ and the Church, establishes between the spouses a permanent and exclusive bond, sealed by God. Accordingly, a marriage between [[Baptism|baptized]] people, validly entered into and consummated, cannot be dissolved. The sacrament confers on them the grace they need for attaining holiness in their married life and for responsible acceptance and upbringing of their children. As a condition for validity, the sacrament is celebrated in the presence of the local [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|Ordinary]] or [[priest|Parish Priest]] or of a cleric delegated by them (or in certain limited circumstances a lay person delegated by the diocesan Bishop with the approval of the [[Episcopal Conference]] and the permission of the [[Holy See]]) and at least two other witnesses,<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3Z.HTM canons 1108 and 1112] of the [[Code of Canon Law]]</ref> though in the theological tradition of the Latin Church the ministers of the sacrament uniquely are the couple themselves. For a valid marriage, a man and a woman must express their conscious and free consent to a definitive self-giving to the other, excluding none of the essential properties and aims of marriage. If one of the two is a non-Catholic Christian, their marriage is licit only if the permission of the competent authority of the Catholic Church is obtained. If one of the two is not a Christian (i.e. has not been [[baptism|baptized]]), the competent authority's dispensation is necessary for validity.\n\n==Validity and liceity==\n{{canon law}}\nAs stated above, the effect of the sacraments comes ''[[ex opere operato]]'' (by the very fact of being administered). Since it is Christ who works through them, their effectiveness does not depend on the worthiness of the minister.  The belief that the validity of the sacrament is dependent upon the holiness of the administrator was rejected in the [[Donatist]] crisis.\n\nHowever, an apparent administration of a sacrament is invalid if the person acting as minister does not have the necessary power (as if a deacon were to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]). They are also invalid if the required \"matter\" or \"form\" is lacking. The matter is the perceptible material object, such as water in baptism or bread and wine for the Eucharist, or the visible action. The form is the verbal statement that specifies the signification of the matter, such as, (in the Western Church), \"N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\". Furthermore, if the minister positively excludes some essential aspect of the sacrament, the sacrament is invalid. This last condition lies behind [[Apostolicae curae|the 1896 judgement of the Holy See]] denying the validity of [[Anglican Orders]], a judgment that, though questioned,<ref name=\"Lamb2017\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/7068/0/anglican-orders-not-invalid-says-cardinal-opening-way-for-revision-of-current-catholic-position-|title=Anglican Orders Not 'Invalid' Says Cardinal, Opening Way for Revision of Current Catholic Position|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|date=9 May 2017|work=The Tablet|access-date=12 July 2017|location=London}}</ref> is still upheld.\n\nA sacrament may be administered [[valid but illicit|validly, but illicitly]], if a condition imposed by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] is not observed. Obvious cases are administration of a sacrament by a priest under a penalty of excommunication or suspension, or an episcopal ordination without the Pontifical mandate (except in certain circumstances outlined in Canon Law).\n\n===Impediments===\n{{Main|Impediment (canon law)}}\n{{see also|Declaration of nullity}}\n[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] specifies [[impediment (canon law)|impediments]] to reception of the sacraments of orders and marriage. Some impediments are merely prohibitive and only concern liceity, but a diriment impediment renders invalid any attempt to confer the sacrament.\n\nIn the Latin Church, only the Holy See can authentically declare when divine law prohibits or invalidates a marriage, and only the Holy See has the right to establish for those who are baptised other impediments to marriage (canon 1075). But individual [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], after having fulfilled certain requirements that include consulting (but not necessarily obtaining approval from) the Holy See, may establish impediments.<ref>Canon 792, ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]''</ref>\n\nIf an impediment is imposed by merely ecclesiastical law, rather than being a matter of divine law, the Church may grant a dispensation from the impediment.\n\nConditions for validity of marriage such as sufficient use of reason (canon 1095) and freedom from coercion (canon 1103), and the requirement that, normally, a marriage be contracted in the presence of the local Ordinary or parish priest or of the priest or deacon delegated by either of them, and in the presence of two witnesses (canon 1108), are not classified in the Code of Canon Law as impediments, but have much the same effect.\n\n===Conditional conferral===\n{{See also|Conditional baptism}}\nThree of the sacraments may not be repeated: Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders: their effect is permanent. This teaching has been expressed by the images of, in the West, an indelible [[Sacramental character|character or mark]] and of, in the East, a seal (CCC 698). However, if there is doubt about the validity of the administration of one or more of these sacraments, a conditional form of conferral may be used, such as: \"If you are not already baptized, I baptize you \u2026\"<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 869]; cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J.], pp. 1057\u20131059.</ref>\n\nIn the recent past, it was common practice in the Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from [[Protestantism]] because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete instance. In the case of the major Protestant [[Christian denomination|denominations]], agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestant tradition. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=5 June 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> It does not recognize a baptismal ceremony in which the names of the three divine persons (or [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]]) of the [[Trinity]]\u2014[[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]\u2014are replaced by descriptors such as [[Creator deity|Creator]], [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redeemer]] and [[Sanctifier]], or Creator, Liberator, and Sustainer, and requires that the conditional form should not be used when baptizing those who have received this kind of baptism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20080201_validity-baptism_en.html |title=Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Catholicism}}\n* [[Thomistic sacramental theology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Raniero Cantalamessa]] OFMCap, ''Introduction'', in: ''Easter in the Early Church.

Symptoms may come and go depending on whether the person receives treatment, and whether the treatment takes effect.\n\n==Causes==\nThyroid autoimmunity is familial.<ref name=\"ref 1\"/> The disease is said to be inherited as a dominant trait since it has been reported that as many as fifty percent of the first degree relatives of patients with some type of autoimmune thyroiditis present with thyroid antibodies in serum.<ref name=\"ref 1\"/> Some studies have even related it to chromosome 21 because of its high correlation with patients with [[Down syndrome]] and familial Alzheimer disease.

Hyperthyroidism can cause sweating, rapid heart rate, anxiety, tremors, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, sudden weight loss, and protruding eyes.<ref name=ref2 /> Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, hair loss, intolerance to cold, and constipation.<ref name=ref2 /> The effects of this disease may be permanent but can sometimes be transient.  Symptoms may come and go depending on whether the person receives treatment, and whether the treatment takes effect.\n\n==Causes==\nThyroid autoimmunity is familial.<ref name=\"ref 1\"/> The disease is said to be inherited as a dominant trait since it has been reported that as many as fifty percent of the first degree relatives of patients with some type of autoimmune thyroiditis present with thyroid antibodies in serum.<ref name=\"ref 1\"/> Some studies have even related it to chromosome 21 because of its high correlation with patients with [[Down syndrome]] and familial Alzheimer disease. This theory is controversial, since patients with [[Turner syndrome]] also present a high prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis (up to fifty percent).<ref name=\"ref 1\"/>\n\n=== High iodine consumption ===\n\nAutoimmune thyroiditis has a higher prevalence in societies that have a higher intake of iodine in their diet, such as the United States and Japan. Also, the rate of lymphocytic infiltration increased in areas where the iodine intake was once low, but increased due to iodine supplementation. \u201cThe prevalence of positive serum tests in such areas rises to over 40 percent within 0.5 to 5 years.\u201d <ref name=\"ref 1\"/>\n\n=== Age ===\n\nIt has been shown that \u201cthe prevalence of positive tests for thyroid antibodies increases with age, with a frequency as high as 33 percent in women 70 years old or older.\u201d<ref name=\"ref 1\"/>   The mean age of prevalence in women is higher than in men by one year, (58 and 59 years old respectively).\n\nAutoimmune thyroiditis can affect children. It is very rare in children under the age of five, but can occur;it accounts for around 40 percent of cases in adolescents with goiters.\n\nPeople with hypothyroidism over the age of 40 have an increased chance of developing autoimmune thyroiditis.<ref name=\"ref 1\"/>\n\n== Mechanism==\nThyroid [[autoantibodies]] appear mostly with the presence of [[lymphocytes]] in the targeted organ.<ref name=\"ref 1\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Weetman|first=A.
