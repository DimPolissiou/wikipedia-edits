It is an adaptation of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s 1957 novel ''[[On the Road]]'' and stars an ensemble cast featuring [[Garrett Hedlund]], [[Sam Riley]], [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Tom Sturridge]], Danny Morgan, [[Elisabeth Moss]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], and [[Viggo Mortensen]]. The executive producers were <!-- perhaps, had been \"It was executive produced by...\" which makes no sense --> [[Francis Ford Coppola]], Patrick Batteux, [[Jerry Leider]], and [[Tessa Ross]]. Filming began on August 4, 2010, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], with a $25 million budget. The story is based on the years Kerouac spent travelling the United States in the late 1940s with his friend [[Neal Cassady]] and several other [[Beat Generation]] figures who would go on to fame in their own right, including [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. On May 23, 2012, the film premiered in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film received mixed early reviews after it premiered at the film festival.

They're invited by mutual friend Chad to meet Dean Moriarty, a young car thief from Denver, and Dean's 16-year-old wife Marylou. Sal and Carlo befriend Dean, smoking [[marijuana]] with him and visiting a jazz nightclub where they meet saxophonist Walter, who also befriends them. Sal teaches Dean how to write before Dean leaves for Denver with Carlo.\n\nAfter much contemplation, writer's block, and a solemn visit to his father's grave, Sal decides to join his friends in Denver and embarks on the road for the first time. There, Sal meets Camille, an art college student for whom Dean is divorcing Marylou. Carlo starts to question his sexuality, and Carlo and Dean start an affair. Carlo, Sal, Camille, and Dean visit a bar where Dean plays \"[[I've Got the World on a String]]\" on the jukebox, and Camille bonds with Sal. Carlo tells Sal he thinks he might be [[gay]], and he plans to travel to Africa.\n\nSal leaves aboard a bus and meets Terry. The two travel to California, where Terry works on cotton fields with her family while Sal helps. Sal and Terry have a brief affair before Sal, realizing he isn't made to work in the fields, heads back home.\n\nIn December 1948, Dean, Marylou, and Ed Dunkel arrive at Sal's sister's home in [[North Carolina]], having left Ed's wife Galatea with Old Bull Lee in [[Louisiana]]. Sal's family feeds the trio, who haven't eaten for 30 hours, and the next day the trio, Sal, and Sal's mother drive back to New York. The guys and Marylou celebrate [[New Year's Eve]] at Carlo's place. Later, Dean convinces Sal to partake in a threesome with him and Marylou. Sal starts kissing Marylou, but Dean's presence makes him nervous, so he tells Dean to go to the kitchen. Following this, Dean and Marylou have sex, while Sal listens in the other room. \n  \nThe next day, they ride off to California and leave Ed at Bull's. When they arrive in San Francisco, Dean drives to Camille's place, leaving Sal and Marylou to rent a room, where the two have sex. The next morning, Marylou leaves to return to her sailor fianc\u00e9 in Denver, and Sal goes over to visit Dean and Camille, who by now have a child together and are expecting a second. Sal and Dean visit a nightclub, leaving Camille alone to deal with the baby. When they return home, she kicks Dean out.\n\nSal and Dean travel to Denver in search of Dean's father, but have no luck finding him. They then travel back to New York with a tall, thin salesman from whom Dean tries to get money in exchange for sex. Dean succeeds, which gives him and Sal enough money to get where they need to go.\n\nEight months later, Dean asks Sal if he would like to drive to Mexico. When they arrive a kid gets high with them and leads them to a whorehouse, where Dean and Sal dance and have sex with some of the prostitutes. They later roam the streets getting stoned and drunk. However, Sal becomes ill and is hospitalized. Dean then leaves Sal behind, returning to San Francisco to fix his relationship with Camille. After recovering, Sal returns to New York.\n\nIn 1950, Sal meets Dean in [[Manhattan]], on his way to a [[Duke Ellington]] concert. Dean says he travelled across the country by train to see Sal and that he is having another child with Camille. Sal's friends hurry him so they can get on their way, and as Sal turns to leave, Dean asks for a lift to [[14th Street (Manhattan)|East 14th Street]]. Sal tells Dean it was good to see him, and leaves him to walk as Sal and his friends depart. When Sal returns home that night, he is able to write his novel about his life on the road with Dean.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:On the road Cannes 2012.jpg|thumb|Cast members (from left) [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Dean Moriarty\n* [[Sam Riley]] as Sal Paradise\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Marylou\n* [[Alice Braga]] as Terry\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Jane\n* [[Tom Sturridge]] as Carlo Marx\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Galatea Dunkel \n* Danny Morgan as Ed Dunkel\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Camille Moriarty\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Old Bull Lee\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Tall thin salesman\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Walter\n* [[Giselle Iti\u00e9]] as Tonia\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Development==\n\n===Previous attempts===\nA [[film adaptation]] of ''On the Road'' had been in [[development hell]] for decades. In 1957, Jack Kerouac wrote a one-page letter to actor [[Marlon Brando]], suggesting that he play Dean Moriarty while Kerouac would portray Sal Paradise.

It is an adaptation of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s 1957 novel ''[[On the Road]]'' and stars an ensemble cast featuring [[Garrett Hedlund]], [[Sam Riley]], [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Tom Sturridge]], Danny Morgan, [[Elisabeth Moss]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], and [[Viggo Mortensen]]. The executive producers were <!-- perhaps, had been \"It was executive produced by...\" which makes no sense --> [[Francis Ford Coppola]], Patrick Batteux, [[Jerry Leider]], and [[Tessa Ross]]. Filming began on August 4, 2010, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], with a $25 million budget. The story is based on the years Kerouac spent travelling the United States in the late 1940s with his friend [[Neal Cassady]] and several other [[Beat Generation]] figures who would go on to fame in their own right, including [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. On May 23, 2012, the film premiered in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film received mixed early reviews after it premiered at the film festival. The film also premiered at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] in September.<ref name=\"Official Selection\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=2012-04-19 |work=Cannes}}</ref><ref name=\"timeout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=2012-04-19 |work=Time Out}}</ref><ref name=\"RotTomatoes\">{{cite news | title = ''On the Road'' | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_road/ | accessdate = 2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1947 New York, on the day his father is buried, Sal Paradise is out with his friend Carlo Marx who is, like him, an aspiring writer. They're invited by mutual friend Chad to meet Dean Moriarty, a young car thief from Denver, and Dean's 16-year-old wife Marylou. Sal and Carlo befriend Dean, smoking [[marijuana]] with him and visiting a jazz nightclub where they meet saxophonist Walter, who also befriends them. Sal teaches Dean how to write before Dean leaves for Denver with Carlo.\n\nAfter much contemplation, writer's block, and a solemn visit to his father's grave, Sal decides to join his friends in Denver and embarks on the road for the first time. There, Sal meets Camille, an art college student for whom Dean is divorcing Marylou. Carlo starts to question his sexuality, and Carlo and Dean start an affair. Carlo, Sal, Camille, and Dean visit a bar where Dean plays \"[[I've Got the World on a String]]\" on the jukebox, and Camille bonds with Sal. Carlo tells Sal he thinks he might be [[gay]], and he plans to travel to Africa.\n\nSal leaves aboard a bus and meets Terry. The two travel to California, where Terry works on cotton fields with her family while Sal helps. Sal and Terry have a brief affair before Sal, realizing he isn't made to work in the fields, heads back home.\n\nIn December 1948, Dean, Marylou, and Ed Dunkel arrive at Sal's sister's home in [[North Carolina]], having left Ed's wife Galatea with Old Bull Lee in [[Louisiana]]. Sal's family feeds the trio, who haven't eaten for 30 hours, and the next day the trio, Sal, and Sal's mother drive back to New York. The guys and Marylou celebrate [[New Year's Eve]] at Carlo's place. Later, Dean convinces Sal to partake in a threesome with him and Marylou. Sal starts kissing Marylou, but Dean's presence makes him nervous, so he tells Dean to go to the kitchen. Following this, Dean and Marylou have sex, while Sal listens in the other room. \n  \nThe next day, they ride off to California and leave Ed at Bull's. When they arrive in San Francisco, Dean drives to Camille's place, leaving Sal and Marylou to rent a room, where the two have sex. The next morning, Marylou leaves to return to her sailor fianc\u00e9 in Denver, and Sal goes over to visit Dean and Camille, who by now have a child together and are expecting a second. Sal and Dean visit a nightclub, leaving Camille alone to deal with the baby. When they return home, she kicks Dean out.\n\nSal and Dean travel to Denver in search of Dean's father, but have no luck finding him. They then travel back to New York with a tall, thin salesman from whom Dean tries to get money in exchange for sex. Dean succeeds, which gives him and Sal enough money to get where they need to go.\n\nEight months later, Dean asks Sal if he would like to drive to Mexico. When they arrive a kid gets high with them and leads them to a whorehouse, where Dean and Sal dance and have sex with some of the prostitutes. They later roam the streets getting stoned and drunk. However, Sal becomes ill and is hospitalized. Dean then leaves Sal behind, returning to San Francisco to fix his relationship with Camille. After recovering, Sal returns to New York.\n\nIn 1950, Sal meets Dean in [[Manhattan]], on his way to a [[Duke Ellington]] concert. Dean says he travelled across the country by train to see Sal and that he is having another child with Camille. Sal's friends hurry him so they can get on their way, and as Sal turns to leave, Dean asks for a lift to [[14th Street (Manhattan)|East 14th Street]]. Sal tells Dean it was good to see him, and leaves him to walk as Sal and his friends depart. When Sal returns home that night, he is able to write his novel about his life on the road with Dean.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:On the road Cannes 2012.jpg|thumb|Cast members (from left) [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Dean Moriarty\n* [[Sam Riley]] as Sal Paradise\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Marylou\n* [[Alice Braga]] as Terry\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Jane\n* [[Tom Sturridge]] as Carlo Marx\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Galatea Dunkel \n* Danny Morgan as Ed Dunkel\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Camille Moriarty\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Old Bull Lee\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Tall thin salesman\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Walter\n* [[Giselle Iti\u00e9]] as Tonia\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Development==\n\n===Previous attempts===\nA [[film adaptation]] of ''On the Road'' had been in [[development hell]] for decades. In 1957, Jack Kerouac wrote a one-page letter to actor [[Marlon Brando]], suggesting that he play Dean Moriarty while Kerouac would portray Sal Paradise.

He is a [[space marine]] dressed in green combat armor who rarely speaks onscreen.\n\nConsidered a symbolic and iconic protagonist and character, the original depiction of the Doom Marine does not have a defined personality and barely portrays a predefined character.

The sole non-playable character, Buddy Dacote, bore the most similarities to the original game's eventual protagonist. \"Dacote\" is an acronym for \"Dies at conclusion of this episode\", and Buddy was supposed to be killed by a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end of the planned third episode. In the [[Doom (1993 video game)|finished product]], this nearly happens to the Marine in the final level of the first episode, but you continue your adventure in episode two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Tom |title=The Doom Bible |year=1992 |publisher=Doomworld (1998) |url=http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |accessdate=June 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021931/http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |archivedate=November 30, 2013 }}</ref> Later, when asked, Tom Hall and John Romero confirmed that the Doomguy is a descendant of [[B.J._Blazkowicz|B.J.Blazkowicz]]. <ref>{{cite web|website=ArsTechnica|title=id Software co-founders confirm that its biggest games\u2019 heroes are all related|year=2018|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/id-software-co-founders-confirm-that-its-biggest-games-heroes-are-all-related/|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Tom|url=https://twitter.com/ThatTomHall/status/958352500431572992|year=2018|accessdate=March 22, 2020|title=Twitter-response about relation between Doomguy, Keen and B.J.Blazkowicz}}</ref>\n\n==Incarnations==\n=== Original series ===\nAfter being ordered to fire upon unarmed civilians, the Marine in Doom fatally punches his commanding officer and is transferred from Earth to Mars. He would go on to be the only survivor after battling on Phobos, Deimos and through Hell, ultimately teleporting to Earth where he discovers that Earth has been invaded by demons.\n\nOn the box art for the original ''Doom'', the Marine is portrayed as muscular, wearing green armor and a light grey space helmet that conceals his facial features. The Marine is firing a machine gun and fighting a Baron of Hell. This image, with the addition of a shotgun clutched in their left hand, is carried over to the introduction screen of ''Doom''. The player's in-game avatar, as seen in multiplayer mode and in the ending of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', is based on this depiction. In multiplayer mode, the character wears green, red, brown and indigo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/sect1.html#8-1-2|title=Official Doom FAQ |website=Gamers.org|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> The Marine's face is seen in the game's [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], where it is shown as a Caucasian male with light brown hair, a [[buzz cut]], and blue eyes. The Marine appears without a helmet in the cover art of ''Doom II'' and in the ending to ''[[Official versions of Doom#The Ultimate Doom|The Ultimate Doom]]'' episode IV, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\".\n\nIn ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Doom II'', and ''[[Final Doom]]'', the Marine expresses little emotion at the horror unfolding around him, maintaining a stern and alert glare, eyes constantly darting left and right. When he takes damage, the Marine's reaction is a mixture of pain and anger. The Marine grins upon picking up a new weapon, and the most emotional face is seen when the Marine suffers 20 [[hit points]] or more taken away during a single attack, showing a shocked face.\n\nHowever, whilst id Software chose a somewhat generic, male pictorial representation of the character for cosmetic as well as gameplay purposes (damage feedback, story transitions), the identity of the Doom Marine is meant to represent the player themselves and so these depictions should only be considered illustrative of the character and not a depiction of what the character looks like. John Romero has been quoted as stating, \"...the [''Doom''] marine ...it's supposed to be YOU [the player]\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe Marine in ''[[Doom 64]]'' is less muscular, with slightly modified green armor with black highlights, a black helmet with an antenna and a blue visor. In ''[[Wolfenstein RPG]]'', it is hinted that the Doom 64 Marine is a descendant of [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], to whom the Marine's helmetless look in the original games bears a striking similarity. In a reference to the Marine's confrontation with the [[Cyberdemon]], when Blazkowicz defeats the \"Harbinger of Doom\", the creature states that he will return in the future to confront his descendants.\n\n===''Doom 3''===\nIn ''[[Doom 3]]'', the Marine's appearance is similar to that of his classic ''Doom'' incarnation as he wears green armor with exposed arms, but it is unlikely the character is meant to represent either the player or the original Doom Marine. The Doom 3 Marine's facial features are not concealed, his muscular build is less exaggerated, and he has black hair. The Marine had recently arrived on Mars and is the newest member of the Marine detachment sent to the planet; his past remains a mystery other than that he holds a rank of Corporal and was sent to replace one of the marines that have mysteriously disappeared. The game begins as Sergeant Kelly briefs him to track down a missing scientist, who warns him of the UAC dabbling into Hell just a moment before the demon invasion begins.\n\nDuring the game the player can interact with several characters, most of whom, like Sergeant Kelly, give the player some briefing regarding his mission. The player character remains silent throughout and is portrayed as tough and fearless in the game's cut scenes; generally only glaring at the demons he sees. When he discovers the towering Cyberdemon for the game's final battle, however, he steps back in fear.\n\n====''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil''====\nIn ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]'', the protagonist is also a different Marine, remains nameless and silent as the other Marine protagonists. He is a [[combat engineer]] who is trained to operate a remote manipulation device known as the \"Ionized Plasma Levitator\" or \"Grabber\". He wears dark blue armor, has a shaved head, and appears to be older than his ''Doom 3'' counterpart, based on his heavily weathered facial features. This Marine is part of a detachment under the command of Dr. Elizabeth McNeil, sent to investigate the Mars UAC facility in the aftermath of the demon invasion. While investigating the ancient Martian ruins, the Marine finds and touches \"the Heart of Hell\" artifact, which released a wave of energy that disintegrated the rest of his squad and opened another portal to Hell underneath the UAC base. This Marine seems to be more of an [[anti-hero]], given that he appears to derive pleasure from using the artifact, which kills almost everyone at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_doom3roe_pc|title=Doom III: Resurrection Of Evil|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===''Doom II RPG''===\nIn [[Doom II RPG]], the marine is one of three protagonists to choose from. His name is '''Stan Blazkowicz''', suggesting he is a descendant of [[Wolfenstein]] protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz.\n\n===''Doom'' (2016)===\nIn the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 ''Doom'']], the identity of the silent protagonist referred to by Hell's forces as the Doom Slayer is ambiguous. \n\nThere are several theories of his possible origins.\nOne origin states that he is the sole surviving member of an order of paladins known as the Night Sentinels, who were tasked with protecting their home and native deities, the Wraiths, from Hell. The Doom Slayer was considered particularly special, as the [[seraphim]] had given him the ability to grow more powerful from the destruction he caused. He has been wreaking murderous havoc on Hell in retribution for a transgression they made against him that is yet to be revealed.\n\nAnother possible origin, solicited in ''Quake Champions'', states that the protagonist is the same Doom Marine from prior games. Such a story might explain why the title character still carries around the foot of his dead pet rabbit, Daisy, as a reminder of what he lost and why he fights.\n\nAccording to the \"Slayer's Testaments\" in the 2016 game, the being known as the \"Doom Slayer\" has been tormenting Hell and its armies for an eternity, and once \"wore the crown of the Night Sentinels\" in the \"first age\". He was given an Argent energy-charged exomantle of controversial design known as the ''Praetor Suit'' by a rogue demon, who was reviled by his own kind as a traitor called ''The Wretch'' for aiding the Doom Slayer's bloody cause. Additionally, at some point the \"seraphim\" further enhanced the Slayer with superhuman strength and speed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/87ua6z/all_of_the_slayers_testaments_from_doom_2016/|title=r/copypasta - All of the Slayer's Testaments from Doom 2016|website=reddit}}</ref>\n\nContrary to previous incarnations, this version is more vaguely characterized: the Doom Slayer is never seen nor heard other than from the first person, and other than gameplay at the beginning of the game that shows him having a Caucasian skin color and the muscular masculine suit seen in the introduction, practically no details are revealed. However, the Doom Slayer's eyes and nose can be made out through the visor of his helmet on the game's box art, the 3D model viewer, and his ''[[Quake Champions]]'' appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> It has been also noted for its visibly irreverent tone conveyed by its hand gestures, [[fist bump]]ing a small Doomguy [[figurine]].<ref name=\"jimquisition\"/>\n\n====''Doom Pinball''====\nThe Doom Slayer, as he appeared in the 2016  ''Doom'', is present in ''[[Doom Pinball]]'', the virtual [[pinball]] adaptation of that game developed by [[Zen Studios]] as one of the three tables of the ''Bethesda Pinball'' pack, an add-on for ''[[Zen Pinball 2]]'', ''[[Pinball FX 2]]'' and ''[[Pinball FX 3]]''.  He is a 3D animated figure placed on the left side of the table that fights the leaders of demon waves on the opposite side of the table, which are also 3D figures, when the player encounters one.  The table's dot-matrix display also occasionally shows the face of the original Doomguy from the 1993 game.\n\n===''Doom Eternal''===\nThe Doom Slayer returns in ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', the 2020 sequel to the 2016 ''Doom'', in which he sets out to continue his war against the legions of Hell as they expand their presence into various realms in the universe, including Earth, [[Heaven]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. In Doom Eternal, it is confirmed that the Doom Slayer is the Doom Marine from the original Doom games, having been brought to the world of Sentinel Prime and given unimaginable power by the servants of the Khan Maykr. Prior to the events of the previous ''Doom'', his rage for the demons becomes so great he stops speaking and only utters curses and gutteral screams, which the player can hear during combat gameplay.\n\nAs the story progresses, more of the Doom Marine's time spent as a Night Sentinel is revealed, including about how he was made one of their great warrior kings and of the betrayal his new people suffered at their own hands due to lies, deceit and misguided faith. On the ravaged Earth, alien to the hellwalker himself, his name is spoken in hushed whispers by the few surviving pockets of individuals left alive planetside.\n\nTo many amongst the ARC (Armored Response Coalition), he is often colloquialized as a fleeting myth passed around by lingering survivors being a one-man army who singlehandedly stands alone against the invading demons, while others amongst the now-corrupt UAC cult attempt to rebuff claims of his existence and prowess on the battlefield as superfluous rumors to demoralize the resistance and anyone left who hadn't yet been slaughtered by the hordes of Doom. From his personal headquarters, Doomguy receives radio wave broadcasts from ARC ground sanctions detailing his exploits as an unknown savior to mankind. Succeeding in his lone crusade against the demons where the latest in cutting-edge technologies devised by the Allied Nations could not, a great many amongst their scientists seemingly praise and worship the Slayer as a vengeful wargod who descended upon the broken world in Man's greatest hour of need.\n\nIt is decidedly vague on whether or not the Slayer has retained any humanity. While many of the analysts who've examined him from within and without his tomb determine he is human from various blood samples of the subject that were taken and studied, one such technician notices trace amounts of exotic material in his genetic makeup that makes him something else. This is confirmed in his final battle with the Khan Maykr, who admonishes him as a once-mortal man who dared to deny her people's way of life. His ascendance to a living force of nature stems from the empowerment given by a rogue Maykr known as Samur Maykr (or the Seraphim) in Doom 2016, who used his race's technology to vastly empower him.\n\n''Doom Eternal'' is more specific about its characterization relative to the previous episode: Doomguy is seen without helmet and in first person, and for the first time in the series' history, he also speaks, voiced in flashback by Matthew Waterson. He also follows the streak for irreverence: a room in his Doom Fortress is filled with [[comic book]]s, collectible [[figurine]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2020/3/20/21177111/doom-eternal-secret-found-map-location-collectible-item-cheat-code-question-mark|title=Doom Eternal secrets, maps, and locations guide|first=Dave|last=Tach|date=March 20, 2020|website=Polygon}}</ref>, [[electric guitar|guitar]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-features-a-guitar-made-of-flesh-and-b/1100-6472897/|title=Doom Eternal Features A Guitar Made Of Flesh And Bones}}</ref> and a [[gaming computer]].\n\n===Novels===\nIn the 1990s [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]], the main character is referred to as '''Flynn \"Fly\" Taggart'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/01/15/crap-shoot-doom-the-novels/ |title=Crap Shoot: Doom - The Novels &#124; Crap Shoot, Features |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref> For the ''Doom 3'' novels, the Marine's name is '''John Kane'''. His past is similar to that of the protagonist in the original ''Doom'', having been demoted after disobeying command to save some of his fellow marines. He is a combat veteran of wars raging on Earth for its remaining resources, including one between the United States and Russia. After arriving on Mars, he is resigned to his fate as a \"glorified security guard\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} While there he befriends fellow marines such as Maria Moraetes{{mdash}}a marine with a similar fate.\n\nDuring the Hellish invasion Kane is forced to take command of several of the surviving marines despite his stripped ranking. He battles the demons singlehandedly or with a few other marines. He is depicted as compassionate to his fellow survivors, working to save the child Theo, and to save the damned in Hell. After volunteering to enter Hell to retrieve the soul cube, Campbell is shown as very impressed by him. He and Maria start to feel romantic ties to each other. During the end of ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom]]'', Kane's leg is blown off and he is admired as the \"man who saved Mars City\".\n\n===Film===\nIn the [[Doom (film)|film adaptation of ''Doom'']], '''John \"Reaper\" Grimm''' ([[Karl Urban]]) is the son of UAC scientists who were killed in an accident during the early excavation of a Martian dig site. Reaper abandoned his scientific heritage and joined the military to forget about this personal tragedy, eventually becoming a member of the elite Rapid Response Tactical Squad. Grimm, his commanding officer Sarge and the other members of the RRTS are dispatched to the UAC Mars facility to investigate the disappearance of several scientists, where they confront humans who have mutated into monsters after being injected with an artificial 24th chromosome. Near the end of the film, Grimm is fatally wounded and injected with the chromosome by his sister to save his life. Instead of becoming a monster, Grimm is granted superhuman strength, reflexes, and regenerative abilities. These new abilities allow him to single-handedly mow down a small horde of monsters and zombies. After killing the now-mutating Sarge, Grimm leaves the base with his nearly-unconscious sister in his arms.\n\n==Guest appearances==\nThe Marine's corpse appears in a secret area in ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''; they are seen halfway through their ''Classic Doom'' death animation clutching their throat and gurgling, surrounded by various Satanic iconography. Upon seeing them, [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] says, \"That's one doomed space marine\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Duke Nukem 3D: Doom Guy | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZxBKPdxxw | date=September 1, 2009 | access-date=March 26, 2020 | author=Blake Morris (uploader) | via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the Saturn version of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the Marine briefly appears at the end of the bonus feature \"Dank & Scuz\".

This was included because [[Activision]], publisher of the ''Tony Hawk'' series and ''Doom 3'', wanted to promote the latter, which was still in development.\n\nIn ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', the Marine appears in three levels under the name \"Doom\". He is described as 6ft (1.83) tall and weighing 180&nbsp;lbs. (81.64&nbsp;kg), according to the character description from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthli.com/quake/warriors.php?character=Doom|title=Warriors - Doom > dur's Quake III Arena|publisher=Earthli|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.earthli.com/quake/images/warriors/p_doom.jpg|title=Doom : Profile|publisher=Data.earthli.com|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> The character \"Phobos\" is also a Doom Marine, though his skin is darker and his armor is orange rather than green.

He is a [[space marine]] dressed in green combat armor who rarely speaks onscreen.\n\nConsidered a symbolic and iconic protagonist and character, the original depiction of the Doom Marine does not have a defined personality and barely portrays a predefined character.

He would go on to be the only survivor after battling on Phobos, Deimos and through Hell, ultimately teleporting to Earth where he discovers that Earth has been invaded by demons.\n\nOn the box art for the original ''Doom'', the Marine is portrayed as muscular, wearing green armor and a light grey space helmet that conceals his facial features. The Marine is firing a machine gun and fighting a Baron of Hell. This image, with the addition of a shotgun clutched in their left hand, is carried over to the introduction screen of ''Doom''. The player's in-game avatar, as seen in multiplayer mode and in the ending of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', is based on this depiction. In multiplayer mode, the character wears green, red, brown and indigo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/sect1.html#8-1-2|title=Official Doom FAQ |website=Gamers.org|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> The Marine's face is seen in the game's [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], where it is shown as a Caucasian male with light brown hair, a [[buzz cut]], and blue eyes. The Marine appears without a helmet in the cover art of ''Doom II'' and in the ending to ''[[Official versions of Doom#The Ultimate Doom|The Ultimate Doom]]'' episode IV, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\".\n\nIn ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Doom II'', and ''[[Final Doom]]'', the Marine expresses little emotion at the horror unfolding around him, maintaining a stern and alert glare, eyes constantly darting left and right. When he takes damage, the Marine's reaction is a mixture of pain and anger. The Marine grins upon picking up a new weapon, and the most emotional face is seen when the Marine suffers 20 [[hit points]] or more taken away during a single attack, showing a shocked face.\n\nHowever, whilst id Software chose a somewhat generic, male pictorial representation of the character for cosmetic as well as gameplay purposes (damage feedback, story transitions), the identity of the Doom Marine is meant to represent the player themselves and so these depictions should only be considered illustrative of the character and not a depiction of what the character looks like. John Romero has been quoted as stating, \"...the [''Doom''] marine ...it's supposed to be YOU [the player]\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe Marine in ''[[Doom 64]]'' is less muscular, with slightly modified green armor with black highlights, a black helmet with an antenna and a blue visor. In ''[[Wolfenstein RPG]]'', it is hinted that the Doom 64 Marine is a descendant of [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], to whom the Marine's helmetless look in the original games bears a striking similarity. In a reference to the Marine's confrontation with the [[Cyberdemon]], when Blazkowicz defeats the \"Harbinger of Doom\", the creature states that he will return in the future to confront his descendants.\n\n===''Doom 3''===\nIn ''[[Doom 3]]'', the Marine's appearance is similar to that of his classic ''Doom'' incarnation as he wears green armor with exposed arms, but it is unlikely the character is meant to represent either the player or the original Doom Marine. The Doom 3 Marine's facial features are not concealed, his muscular build is less exaggerated, and he has black hair. The Marine had recently arrived on Mars and is the newest member of the Marine detachment sent to the planet; his past remains a mystery other than that he holds a rank of Corporal and was sent to replace one of the marines that have mysteriously disappeared. The game begins as Sergeant Kelly briefs him to track down a missing scientist, who warns him of the UAC dabbling into Hell just a moment before the demon invasion begins.\n\nDuring the game the player can interact with several characters, most of whom, like Sergeant Kelly, give the player some briefing regarding his mission. The player character remains silent throughout and is portrayed as tough and fearless in the game's cut scenes; generally only glaring at the demons he sees. When he discovers the towering Cyberdemon for the game's final battle, however, he steps back in fear.\n\n====''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil''====\nIn ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]'', the protagonist is also a different Marine, remains nameless and silent as the other Marine protagonists. He is a [[combat engineer]] who is trained to operate a remote manipulation device known as the \"Ionized Plasma Levitator\" or \"Grabber\". He wears dark blue armor, has a shaved head, and appears to be older than his ''Doom 3'' counterpart, based on his heavily weathered facial features. This Marine is part of a detachment under the command of Dr. Elizabeth McNeil, sent to investigate the Mars UAC facility in the aftermath of the demon invasion. While investigating the ancient Martian ruins, the Marine finds and touches \"the Heart of Hell\" artifact, which released a wave of energy that disintegrated the rest of his squad and opened another portal to Hell underneath the UAC base. This Marine seems to be more of an [[anti-hero]], given that he appears to derive pleasure from using the artifact, which kills almost everyone at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_doom3roe_pc|title=Doom III: Resurrection Of Evil|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===''Doom II RPG''===\nIn [[Doom II RPG]], the marine is one of three protagonists to choose from. His name is '''Stan Blazkowicz''', suggesting he is a descendant of [[Wolfenstein]] protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz.\n\n===''Doom'' (2016)===\nIn the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 ''Doom'']], the identity of the silent protagonist referred to by Hell's forces as the Doom Slayer is ambiguous. \n\nThere are several theories of his possible origins.\nOne origin states that he is the sole surviving member of an order of paladins known as the Night Sentinels, who were tasked with protecting their home and native deities, the Wraiths, from Hell. The Doom Slayer was considered particularly special, as the [[seraphim]] had given him the ability to grow more powerful from the destruction he caused. He has been wreaking murderous havoc on Hell in retribution for a transgression they made against him that is yet to be revealed.\n\nAnother possible origin, solicited in ''Quake Champions'', states that the protagonist is the same Doom Marine from prior games. Such a story might explain why the title character still carries around the foot of his dead pet rabbit, Daisy, as a reminder of what he lost and why he fights.\n\nAccording to the \"Slayer's Testaments\" in the 2016 game, the being known as the \"Doom Slayer\" has been tormenting Hell and its armies for an eternity, and once \"wore the crown of the Night Sentinels\" in the \"first age\". He was given an Argent energy-charged exomantle of controversial design known as the ''Praetor Suit'' by a rogue demon, who was reviled by his own kind as a traitor called ''The Wretch'' for aiding the Doom Slayer's bloody cause. Additionally, at some point the \"seraphim\" further enhanced the Slayer with superhuman strength and speed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/87ua6z/all_of_the_slayers_testaments_from_doom_2016/|title=r/copypasta - All of the Slayer's Testaments from Doom 2016|website=reddit}}</ref>\n\nContrary to previous incarnations, this version is more vaguely characterized: the Doom Slayer is never seen nor heard other than from the first person, and other than gameplay at the beginning of the game that shows him having a Caucasian skin color and the muscular masculine suit seen in the introduction, practically no details are revealed. However, the Doom Slayer's eyes and nose can be made out through the visor of his helmet on the game's box art, the 3D model viewer, and his ''[[Quake Champions]]'' appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> It has been also noted for its visibly irreverent tone conveyed by its hand gestures, [[fist bump]]ing a small Doomguy [[figurine]].<ref name=\"jimquisition\"/>\n\n====''Doom Pinball''====\nThe Doom Slayer, as he appeared in the 2016  ''Doom'', is present in ''[[Doom Pinball]]'', the virtual [[pinball]] adaptation of that game developed by [[Zen Studios]] as one of the three tables of the ''Bethesda Pinball'' pack, an add-on for ''[[Zen Pinball 2]]'', ''[[Pinball FX 2]]'' and ''[[Pinball FX 3]]''.  He is a 3D animated figure placed on the left side of the table that fights the leaders of demon waves on the opposite side of the table, which are also 3D figures, when the player encounters one.  The table's dot-matrix display also occasionally shows the face of the original Doomguy from the 1993 game.\n\n===''Doom Eternal''===\nThe Doom Slayer returns in ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', the 2020 sequel to the 2016 ''Doom'', in which he sets out to continue his war against the legions of Hell as they expand their presence into various realms in the universe, including Earth, [[Heaven]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. In Doom Eternal, it is confirmed that the Doom Slayer is the Doom Marine from the original Doom games, having been brought to the world of Sentinel Prime and given unimaginable power by the servants of the Khan Maykr. Prior to the events of the previous ''Doom'', his rage for the demons becomes so great he stops speaking and only utters curses and gutteral screams, which the player can hear during combat gameplay.\n\nAs the story progresses, more of the Doom Marine's time spent as a Night Sentinel is revealed, including about how he was made one of their great warrior kings and of the betrayal his new people suffered at their own hands due to lies, deceit and misguided faith. On the ravaged Earth, alien to the hellwalker himself, his name is spoken in hushed whispers by the few surviving pockets of individuals left alive planetside.\n\nTo many amongst the ARC (Armored Response Coalition), he is often colloquialized as a fleeting myth passed around by lingering survivors being a one-man army who singlehandedly stands alone against the invading demons, while others amongst the now-corrupt UAC cult attempt to rebuff claims of his existence and prowess on the battlefield as superfluous rumors to demoralize the resistance and anyone left who hadn't yet been slaughtered by the hordes of Doom. From his personal headquarters, Doomguy receives radio wave broadcasts from ARC ground sanctions detailing his exploits as an unknown savior to mankind. Succeeding in his lone crusade against the demons where the latest in cutting-edge technologies devised by the Allied Nations could not, a great many amongst their scientists seemingly praise and worship the Slayer as a vengeful wargod who descended upon the broken world in Man's greatest hour of need.\n\nIt is decidedly vague on whether or not the Slayer has retained any humanity. While many of the analysts who've examined him from within and without his tomb determine he is human from various blood samples of the subject that were taken and studied, one such technician notices trace amounts of exotic material in his genetic makeup that makes him something else. This is confirmed in his final battle with the Khan Maykr, who admonishes him as a once-mortal man who dared to deny her people's way of life. His ascendance to a living force of nature stems from the empowerment given by a rogue Maykr known as Samur Maykr (or the Seraphim) in Doom 2016, who used his race's technology to vastly empower him.\n\n''Doom Eternal'' is more specific about its characterization relative to the previous episode: Doomguy is seen without helmet and in first person, and for the first time in the series' history, he also speaks, voiced in flashback by Matthew Waterson. He also follows the streak for irreverence: a room in his Doom Fortress is filled with [[comic book]]s, collectible [[figurine]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2020/3/20/21177111/doom-eternal-secret-found-map-location-collectible-item-cheat-code-question-mark|title=Doom Eternal secrets, maps, and locations guide|first=Dave|last=Tach|date=March 20, 2020|website=Polygon}}</ref>, [[electric guitar|guitar]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-features-a-guitar-made-of-flesh-and-b/1100-6472897/|title=Doom Eternal Features A Guitar Made Of Flesh And Bones}}</ref> and a [[gaming computer]].\n\n===Novels===\nIn the 1990s [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]], the main character is referred to as '''Flynn \"Fly\" Taggart'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/01/15/crap-shoot-doom-the-novels/ |title=Crap Shoot: Doom - The Novels &#124; Crap Shoot, Features |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref> For the ''Doom 3'' novels, the Marine's name is '''John Kane'''. His past is similar to that of the protagonist in the original ''Doom'', having been demoted after disobeying command to save some of his fellow marines. He is a combat veteran of wars raging on Earth for its remaining resources, including one between the United States and Russia. After arriving on Mars, he is resigned to his fate as a \"glorified security guard\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} While there he befriends fellow marines such as Maria Moraetes{{mdash}}a marine with a similar fate.\n\nDuring the Hellish invasion Kane is forced to take command of several of the surviving marines despite his stripped ranking. He battles the demons singlehandedly or with a few other marines. He is depicted as compassionate to his fellow survivors, working to save the child Theo, and to save the damned in Hell. After volunteering to enter Hell to retrieve the soul cube, Campbell is shown as very impressed by him. He and Maria start to feel romantic ties to each other. During the end of ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom]]'', Kane's leg is blown off and he is admired as the \"man who saved Mars City\".\n\n===Film===\nIn the [[Doom (film)|film adaptation of ''Doom'']], '''John \"Reaper\" Grimm''' ([[Karl Urban]]) is the son of UAC scientists who were killed in an accident during the early excavation of a Martian dig site. Reaper abandoned his scientific heritage and joined the military to forget about this personal tragedy, eventually becoming a member of the elite Rapid Response Tactical Squad. Grimm, his commanding officer Sarge and the other members of the RRTS are dispatched to the UAC Mars facility to investigate the disappearance of several scientists, where they confront humans who have mutated into monsters after being injected with an artificial 24th chromosome. Near the end of the film, Grimm is fatally wounded and injected with the chromosome by his sister to save his life. Instead of becoming a monster, Grimm is granted superhuman strength, reflexes, and regenerative abilities. These new abilities allow him to single-handedly mow down a small horde of monsters and zombies. After killing the now-mutating Sarge, Grimm leaves the base with his nearly-unconscious sister in his arms.\n\n==Guest appearances==\nThe Marine's corpse appears in a secret area in ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''; they are seen halfway through their ''Classic Doom'' death animation clutching their throat and gurgling, surrounded by various Satanic iconography. Upon seeing them, [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] says, \"That's one doomed space marine\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Duke Nukem 3D: Doom Guy | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZxBKPdxxw | date=September 1, 2009 | access-date=March 26, 2020 | author=Blake Morris (uploader) | via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the Saturn version of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the Marine briefly appears at the end of the bonus feature \"Dank & Scuz\".

This was included because [[Activision]], publisher of the ''Tony Hawk'' series and ''Doom 3'', wanted to promote the latter, which was still in development.\n\nIn ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', the Marine appears in three levels under the name \"Doom\".

The third Doom Marine in the game, a woman named \"Crash\", is mentioned as being Doom's training instructor before arriving at the Arena.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'', after the first cut scene, the player enters a dune buggy with a bobble head of the Marine on the dashboard. The Easter egg in the game's Gearhead vault level is the first room from the ''Doom'' game, where the player can pick up a Doom Marine bobblehead.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} \n\nThe Doom Slayer is a playable character in the game ''[[Quake Champions]]''.

As [[Renaissance magic|Renaissance occultism]] gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the [[folk religion]] of the uneducated rural population at best, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all ''maleficium''.{{efn|Early Christian theologians attributed to the Devil responsibility for persecution, heresy, witchcraft, sin, natural disasters, human calamities, and whatever else went wrong.

He did so at the request of inquisitor [[Heinrich Kramer]], who had been refused permission by the local bishops in Germany to investigate.<ref>Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'', (49)</ref> However, historians such as [[Ludwig von Pastor]] insist that the bull neither allowed anything new nor was necessarily binding on Catholic consciences.{{efn|\"The Bull contains no dogmatic decision of any sort on witchcraft. It assumes the possibility of demoniacal influences on human beings which the Church has always maintained, but claims no dogmatic authority for its pronouncement on the particular cases with which it was dealing at the moment. The form of the document, which refers only to certain occurrences which had been brought to the knowledge of the Pope, sh[o]ws that it was not intended to bind any one to believe in the things mentioned in it. The question whether the Pope himself believed in them has nothing to do with the subject. His judgment on this point has no greater importance than attaches to a Papal decree in any other undogmatic question, e.g., on a dispute about a benefice. The Bull introduced no new element into the current beliefs about witchcraft. It is absurd to accuse it of being the cause of the cruel treatment of witches, when we see in the ''Sachsenspiegel'' that burning alive was already the legal punishment for a witch. All that Innocent VIII. did was to confirm the jurisdiction of the inquisitors over these cases. The Bull simply empowered them to try all matters concerning witchcraft, without exception, before their own tribunals, by Canon-law; a process which was totally different from that of the later trials. Possibly the Bull, in so far as it admonished the inquisitors to be on the alert in regard to witchcraft may have given an impetus to the prosecution of such cases; but it affords no justification for the accusation that it introduced a new crime, or was in any way responsible for the iniquitous horrors of the witch-harrying of later times.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |author-link=Ludwig von Pastor |title=The History of the Popes, from the Close of the Middle Ages |volume=5 |pages=349\u2013350}}</ref>}} Three years later in 1487, Kramer published the notorious ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (lit., 'Hammer against the Evildoers') which, because of the newly invented printing presses, enjoyed a wide readership.

In 1538, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] cautioned its members not to believe what the ''Malleus'' said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.

The Chhotanagpur region was majorly populated by an [[adivasi]] population called the Santhals. The existence of witches was a belief central to the Santhals. Witches were feared and were supposed to be engaged in anti-social activities. They were also supposed to have the power to kill people by feeding on their entrails, and causing fevers in cattle among other evils. Therefore, according to the adivasi population the cure to their disease and sickness was the elimination of these witches who were seen as the cause.<ref name=\"Sinha 1672\u20131676\">{{cite journal |last=Sinha |first= Shashank|title= Witch hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur |jstor= 4419566 |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=42 |issue= 19|pages= 1672\u20131676|year= 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of witch-hunt among Santhals was more brutal than that in Europe.

Despite the ban, very few cases were reported as witch-hunting was not seen as a crime. The Santhals believed that the ban in fact allowed the witches to flourish. Thus, the effect of the ban was contrary to what the British had intended. During 1857\u201358, there was a surge in witch-hunting. This can be viewed as a mode of resistance to the British rule as part of the larger revolt of 1857.<ref name=\"Sinha 1672\u20131676\"/>\n\n==Modern cases==\n{{Main|Modern witch-hunts}}\n\n[[File:Bernau Hexendenkmal.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument for the victims of the witch-hunts of 16th- and 17th-century Bernau, Germany by [[Annelie Grund]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anton-praetorius.de/downloads/Denkmaeler+fuer+Opfer+Hexenprozesse+in+Europa+und+Salem+USA+2.pdf|title=Entschuldigung|website=anton-praetorius.de}}</ref>\n]]\nWitch-hunts still occur today in societies where belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] is prevalent.

Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'', relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba people]] of Zambia.<ref>''A Modern Movement of Witch Finders'' Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London.</ref> They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to \"yield up his horns\"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.\n\nThe villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.\n\nThe Bemba people believed misfortunes such as [[wart]]ings, [[haunting]]s and [[famine]]s to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa, beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nAmongst the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes of Southern Africa, the [[witch smeller]]s were responsible for detecting witches.

This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries.

As [[Renaissance magic|Renaissance occultism]] gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the [[folk religion]] of the uneducated rural population at best, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all ''maleficium''.{{efn|Early Christian theologians attributed to the Devil responsibility for persecution, heresy, witchcraft, sin, natural disasters, human calamities, and whatever else went wrong.

He did so at the request of inquisitor [[Heinrich Kramer]], who had been refused permission by the local bishops in Germany to investigate.<ref>Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'', (49)</ref> However, historians such as [[Ludwig von Pastor]] insist that the bull neither allowed anything new nor was necessarily binding on Catholic consciences.{{efn|\"The Bull contains no dogmatic decision of any sort on witchcraft. It assumes the possibility of demoniacal influences on human beings which the Church has always maintained, but claims no dogmatic authority for its pronouncement on the particular cases with which it was dealing at the moment. The form of the document, which refers only to certain occurrences which had been brought to the knowledge of the Pope, sh[o]ws that it was not intended to bind any one to believe in the things mentioned in it. The question whether the Pope himself believed in them has nothing to do with the subject. His judgment on this point has no greater importance than attaches to a Papal decree in any other undogmatic question, e.g., on a dispute about a benefice. The Bull introduced no new element into the current beliefs about witchcraft. It is absurd to accuse it of being the cause of the cruel treatment of witches, when we see in the ''Sachsenspiegel'' that burning alive was already the legal punishment for a witch. All that Innocent VIII. did was to confirm the jurisdiction of the inquisitors over these cases. The Bull simply empowered them to try all matters concerning witchcraft, without exception, before their own tribunals, by Canon-law; a process which was totally different from that of the later trials. Possibly the Bull, in so far as it admonished the inquisitors to be on the alert in regard to witchcraft may have given an impetus to the prosecution of such cases; but it affords no justification for the accusation that it introduced a new crime, or was in any way responsible for the iniquitous horrors of the witch-harrying of later times.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |author-link=Ludwig von Pastor |title=The History of the Popes, from the Close of the Middle Ages |volume=5 |pages=349\u2013350}}</ref>}} Three years later in 1487, Kramer published the notorious ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (lit., 'Hammer against the Evildoers') which, because of the newly invented printing presses, enjoyed a wide readership.

The use of magic was considered wrong, not because it failed, but because it worked effectively for the wrong reasons. Witchcraft was a normal part of everyday life. Witches were often called for, along with religious ministers, to help the ill or deliver a baby. They held positions of spiritual power in their communities. When something went wrong, no one questioned either the ministers or the power of the witchcraft. Instead, they questioned whether the witch intended to inflict harm or not.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Peter G. |title=The Long European Reformation |year=2004 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-333-64451-5 |pages=210\u2013215}}</ref>\n\nCurrent scholarly estimates of the number of people who were executed for witchcraft vary from about 40,000 to 100,000.{{efn|name=\"ReferenceA\"|[[Brian P.

Thus, the effect of the ban was contrary to what the British had intended. During 1857\u201358, there was a surge in witch-hunting.

Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'', relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba people]] of Zambia.<ref>''A Modern Movement of Witch Finders'' Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London.</ref> They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to \"yield up his horns\"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.\n\nThe villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.\n\nThe Bemba people believed misfortunes such as [[wart]]ings, [[haunting]]s and [[famine]]s to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa.
