The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Mako|2010|p=45}}</ref> The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\">{{harvnb|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}:'The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref> and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Mako|2010|p=45}}</ref> The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\">{{harvnb|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}:'The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref> and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

A type of scheme is [[polysyndeton]], the repeating of a conjunction before every element in a list, where normally the conjunction would appear only before the last element, as in \"Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!\"\u2014emphasizing the danger and number of animals more than the prosaic wording with only the second \"and\". A type of trope is [[metaphor]], describing one thing as something that it clearly is not, in order to lead the mind to compare them, as in \"All the world's a stage.\"\n\n== Four rhetorical operations ==\n{{Main|Rhetorical operations}}\n\n[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':<ref name=\"Jansen\">Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: <blockquote>Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils\u2019 own writing.</blockquote></ref>\n\n* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance\n* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack\n* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring\n* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation\n\nThese categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (pleonasmos - addition), \u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (endeia - omission), \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (metathesis - transposition) and \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (enallage - permutation).<ref>Book V, 21.29, pp.303\u20135</ref> Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.<ref>Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38\u201341.

The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:\n\n* \"Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran\" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.\n:Whereas, \"Sister Suzy\u2018s sewing socks for soldiers\" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.\n:Both are commonly used in poetry.\n* \"She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains\" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.\n* \"Painful pride\" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.\n*\"An Einstein\" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.\n* \"I had butterflies in my stomach\" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.\n:To say \"it was like having some butterflies in my stomach\" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.\n:To say \"It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach\", \"It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach\", or \"I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach\" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.\n*\"That filthy place was really dirty\" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.\n<!--\nThe following figures of speech have not been added to the visible text of this article yet.

''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|sch\u0113ma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, \"John, my best friend\" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning (\"For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men\").\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book ''Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay''<ref>Robert DiYanni, ''Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay'', Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, p. 451</ref> wrote: \"Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense.\"\n\nFor simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., \"Figures of Disorder\"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.\n\n=== Schemes ===\n* [[Accumulation (figure of speech)|accumulation]]: Accumulating arguments in a concise forceful manner.\n* [[adnomination]]: Repetition of words with the same [[root word]].\n* [[alliteration]]: a literary stylistic device, where a series of words in a row have the same first consonant sound. \n*: Example: \"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\".\n* [[adynaton]]: [[Hyperbole]]. It is an extreme exaggeration used to make a point. It is like the opposite of \"understatement\".\n*: Example: \"I've told you a million times.\" \n* [[anacoluthon]]: Transposition of clauses to achieve an unnatural order in a sentence.\n* [[anadiplosis]]: Repetition of a word at the end of a clause and then at the beginning of its succeeding clause.\n* [[anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]]: Repetition of the same word or set of words in a paragraph.\n* [[anastrophe]]: Changing the [[object (grammar)|object]], [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and verb order in a clause.\n* [[Anti-climax (figure of speech)|anti-climax]]: It is when a specific point, expectations are raised, everything is built-up and then suddenly something boring or disappointing happens.\n*: Example: \"People, pets, batteries, ... all are dead.\"\n* [[anthimeria]]: Transformation of a word of a certain word class to another word class.\n* [[antimetabole]]: A sentence consisting of the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in reverse order.\n* [[:wiktionary:antirrhesis|antirrhesis]]: Disproving an opponent's argument.\n* [[epistrophe|antistrophe]]: Repetition of the same word or group of words in a paragraph in the end of sentences.\n* [[antithesis]]: Juxtaposition of opposing or contrasting ideas.\n* [[aphorismus]]: Statement that calls into question the definition of a word.\n* [[aposiopesis]]: Breaking off or pausing speech for dramatic or emotional effect.\n* [[apposition]]: Placing of two statements side by side, in which the second defines the first.\n* [[assonance]]: Repetition of vowel sounds.\n* [[asteismus]]: Mocking answer or humorous answer that plays on a word.\n* [[:wiktionary:asterismos|asterismos]]: Beginning a segment of speech with an exclamation of a word.\n* [[asyndeton]]: Omission of conjunctions between related clauses.\n* [[cacophony]]: Words producing a harsh sound.\n* [[cataphora]]: Co-reference of one expression with another expression which follows it, in which the latter defines the first. (example: If you need one, there's a towel in the top drawer.)\n* [[classification (literature & grammar)|classification]]: Linking a proper noun and a common noun with an article\n* [[chiasmus]]: Two or more clauses are related to each other through a reversal of structures in order to make a larger point\n* [[climax (figure of speech)|climax]]: Arrangement of words in order of descending to ascending order.\n* commoratio: Repetition of an idea, re-worded\n* conduplicatio: Repetition of a key word\n* [[conversion (word formation)]]: An unaltered transformation of a word of one word class into another word class\n* [[Literary consonance|consonance]]: Repetition of consonant sounds, most commonly within a short passage of verse\n* [[correlative verse]]: Matching items in two sequences\n* [[diacope]]: Repetition of a word or phrase with one or two intervening words\n* [[:wiktionary:asterismos|dubitatio]]: Expressing doubt and uncertainty about oneself\n* [[:wiktionary:tmesis|dystmesis]]: A synonym for [[tmesis]]\n* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]]: Omission of words\n* [[elision]]: Omission of one or more letters in speech, making it colloquial\n* [[enallage]]: Wording ignoring grammatical rules or conventions\n* [[enjambment]]: Incomplete sentences at the end of lines in poetry\n* [[enthymeme]]: An informal [[syllogism]]\n* [[epanalepsis]]: Ending sentences with their beginning.\n* [[epanodos]]: Word repetition.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mWw3sbiCWtAC&pg=PT239&dq=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22 |title=The scientific and literary treasury \u2013 Samuel Maunder \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2013-05-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906005240/https://books.google.com/books?id=mWw3sbiCWtAC&pg=PT239&dq=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22&redir_esc=y |archivedate=2017-09-06 |last1=Maunder |first1=Samuel |year=1841 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jlZBAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT616&dq=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22 |title=Universal Technological Dictionary Or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used \u2026 \u2013 George Crabb \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2013-05-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906005240/https://books.google.com/books?id=jlZBAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT616&dq=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22&redir_esc=y |archivedate=2017-09-06 |last1=Crabb |first1=George |year=1823 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ztu2AAAAIAAJ&q=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22&dq=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22 |title=Naming-day in Eden: The Creation and Recreation of Language \u2013 Noah Jonathan Jacobs \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2013-05-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906005240/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ztu2AAAAIAAJ&q=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22&dq=epanodos+%22figure+of+speech%22&redir_esc=y |archivedate=2017-09-06 |last1=Jacobs |first1=Noah Jonathan |year=1969 }}</ref>\n* [[epistrophe]]: (also known as antistrophe) Repetition of the same word or group of words at the end of successive clauses.

A type of scheme is [[polysyndeton]], the repeating of a conjunction before every element in a list, where normally the conjunction would appear only before the last element, as in \"Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!\"\u2014emphasizing the danger and number of animals more than the prosaic wording with only the second \"and\".

Quote from the summary: <blockquote>Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils\u2019 own writing.</blockquote></ref>\n\n* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance\n* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack\n* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring\n* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation\n\nThese categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (pleonasmos - addition), \u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (endeia - omission), \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (metathesis - transposition) and \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ae (enallage - permutation).<ref>Book V, 21.29, pp.303\u20135</ref> Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.<ref>Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38\u201341. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]</ref> [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 - prosthesis), subtraction (\u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 - afairesis), transposition (\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 - metathesis), and transmutation (\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 - alloiosis).<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nFigures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:\n\n* \"Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran\" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.\n:Whereas, \"Sister Suzy\u2018s sewing socks for soldiers\" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.\n:Both are commonly used in poetry.\n* \"She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains\" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.\n* \"Painful pride\" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.\n*\"An Einstein\" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.\n* \"I had butterflies in my stomach\" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.\n:To say \"it was like having some butterflies in my stomach\" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.\n:To say \"It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach\", \"It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach\", or \"I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach\" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.\n*\"That filthy place was really dirty\" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.\n<!--\nThe following figures of speech have not been added to the visible text of this article yet.

''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|sch\u0113ma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, \"John, my best friend\" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning (\"For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men\").\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book ''Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay''<ref>Robert DiYanni, ''Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay'', Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, p. 451</ref> wrote: \"Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense.\"\n\nFor simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., \"Figures of Disorder\"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.\n\n=== Schemes ===\n* [[Accumulation (figure of speech)|accumulation]]: Accumulating arguments in a concise forceful manner.\n* [[adnomination]]: Repetition of words with the same [[root word]].\n* [[alliteration]]: a literary stylistic device, where a series of words in a row have the same first consonant sound. \n*: Example: \"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\".\n* [[adynaton]]: [[Hyperbole]].

Many [[repeater]]s are located on hilltops or on tall buildings as the higher location increases their coverage area, sometimes referred to as the [[radio horizon]], or \"footprint\". Amateur radio repeaters are similar in concept to those used by public safety entities (police, fire department, etc.), businesses, government, military, and more. Amateur radio repeaters may even use commercially packaged repeater systems that have been adjusted to operate within amateur radio frequency bands, but more often amateur repeaters are assembled from receivers, transmitters, controllers, power supplies, antennas, and other components, from various sources.\n\n== Introduction ==\nIn [[amateur radio]], repeaters are typically maintained by individual [[hobby]]ists or local groups of [[amateur radio operators]].  Many repeaters are provided openly to other amateur radio operators and typically not used as a [[remote base station]] by a single user or group. In some areas multiple repeaters are linked together to form a wide-coverage network, such as the linked system provided by the Independent Repeater Association<ref>http://[http://w8ira.org w8ira.org] Independent Repeater Association</ref> which covers most of western Michigan, or the Western Intertie Network System (\"WINsystem\") that now covers a great deal of California, and is in 17 other states, including Hawaii, along with parts of four other countries, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and Japan.<ref>http://www.winsystem.org A series of linked, or Intertied, UHF (440 MHz, or 70 cm) repeaters</ref>\n\n=== Frequencies ===\nRepeaters are found mainly in the [[VHF]] [[6 meters|6 meter]] (50\u201354&nbsp;MHz),  [[2 meters|2 meter]] (144\u2013148&nbsp;MHz), [[1.25-meter band]] (1{{frac|1|4}} meters) (220\u2013225&nbsp;MHz) and the [[UHF]] [[70 centimeters|70 centimeter]] (420\u2013450&nbsp;MHz) bands, but can be used on almost any frequency pair above [[10 meters|28 MHz]]. In some areas, [[33 centimeters]] (902\u2013928&nbsp;MHz) and [[23 centimeters]] (1.24\u20131.3&nbsp;GHz) are also used for repeaters.  Note that different countries have different rules; for example, in the United States, the two meter band is 144\u2013148&nbsp;MHz, while in the United Kingdom (and most of Europe) it is 144\u2013146&nbsp;MHz.\n\nRepeater frequency sets are known as \"repeater pairs\", and in the ham radio community most follow ''ad hoc'' standards for the difference between the two frequencies, commonly called the ''offset''.  In the USA two-meter band, the standard offset is 600&nbsp;kHz (0.6&nbsp;MHz), but sometimes unusual offsets, referred to as ''oddball splits'', are used. The actual frequency pair used is assigned by a local frequency coordinating council.\n\nIn the days of crystal-controlled radios, these pairs were identified by the last portion of the transmit ''(Input)'' frequency followed by the last portion of the receive ''(Output)'' frequency that the ham would put into the radio.  Thus \"three-four nine-four\" (34/94) meant that hams would transmit on 146.34&nbsp;MHz and listen on 146.94&nbsp;MHz (while the repeater would do the opposite, listening on 146.34 and transmitting on 146.94).  In areas with many repeaters, \"reverse splits\" were common (i.e., 94/34), to prevent interference between systems.\n\nSince the late 1970s, the use of synthesized, microprocessor-controlled radios, and widespread adoption of standard frequency splits have changed the way repeater pairs are described.  In 1980, a ham might have been told that a repeater was on \"22/82\"\u2014today they will most often be told \"682 down\".  The 6 refers to the last digit of 146&nbsp;MHz, so that the display will read \"146.82\" (the output frequency), and the radio is set to transmit \"down\" 600&nbsp;kHz on 146.22&nbsp;MHz. Another way of describing a repeater frequency pair is to give the repeater's output frequency, along with the direction of offset (\"+\" or \"plus\" for an input frequency above the output frequency, \"\u2212\" or \"minus\" for a lower frequency) with the assumption that the repeater uses the standard offset for the band in question. For instance, a 2-meter repeater might be described as \"147.34 with a plus offset\", meaning that the repeater transmits on 147.34&nbsp;MHz and receives on 147.94&nbsp;MHz, 600&nbsp;kHz above the output frequency.\n\n=== Services ===\nServices provided by a repeater may include an [[autopatch]] connection to a [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]/[[PSTN]] [[telephone]] line to allow users to make telephone calls from their keypad-equipped radios. These advanced services may be limited to members of the group or club that maintains the repeater.  Many amateur radio repeaters typically have a tone access control ([[CTCSS]], also called [[CTCSS#Vendor names|CG]] or [[CTCSS|PL tone]]) implemented to prevent them from being keyed-up (operated) accidentally by [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from other radio signals. A few use a digital code system called ''DCS'', '''DCG''' or ''DPL'' (a [[Motorola]] trademark). In the UK most repeaters also respond to a short burst of 1750&nbsp;Hz tone to open the repeater.\n\nIn many communities, a repeater has become a major on-the-air gathering spot for the local amateur radio community, especially during \"drive time\" (the morning or afternoon commuting time). In the evenings local public service nets may be heard on these systems and many repeaters are used by [[weather spotter]]s. In an emergency or a disaster a repeater can sometimes help to provide needed communications between areas that could not otherwise communicate. Until [[cellular telephone]]s became popular, it was common for community repeaters to have \"drive time\" monitoring stations so that mobile amateurs could call in traffic accidents via the repeater to the monitoring station who could relay it to the local police agencies via telephone. Systems with autopatches frequently had (and still have) most of the public safety agencies numbers programmed as speed-dial numbers.\n\n=== US repeater coordination ===\nRepeater coordination is not required by the Federal Communications Commission, nor does the FCC regulate, certify or otherwise regulate frequency coordination for the Amateur Radio Bands.\n\nAmateur Radio Repeater Coordinators or coordination groups are all volunteers and have no legal authority to assume jurisdictional or regional control in any area where the Federal Communications Commission regulates the Amateur Radio Service.   The United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 CFR, Part 97, which are the laws in which the Amateur Radio Service is regulated clearly states the definition of Frequency Coordinator.\n\nThe purpose of coordinating a repeater or frequency is to reduce harmful interference to other fixed operations.   Coordinating a repeater or frequency with other fixed operations demonstrates good engineering and amateur practice.\n\n=== UK repeaters ===\nIn the UK, the frequency allocations for repeaters are managed by the [[Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee (ETCC)]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrepeater.net|title=ukrepeaters|author=|date=|website=www.ukrepeater.net|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] and licensed by [[Ofcom]], the industry regulator for communications in the UK. Each repeater has a NOV (Notice of Variation) licence issued to a particular amateur radio callsign (this person is normally known as the \"repeater keeper\") thus ensuring the licensing authority has a single point of contact for that particular repeater.\n\nEach repeater in the UK is normally supported by a repeater group composed of local amateur radio enthusiasts who pay a nominal amount e.g. \u00a310\u201315 a year each to support the maintenance of each repeater and to pay for site rents, electricity costs etc. Repeater groups do not receive any central funding from other organisations.\n\nSuch groups include the [[Central Scotland FM Group]]<ref>http://www.csfmg.com Central Scotland FM Group</ref> and the [[Scottish Borders Repeater Group]].<ref>http://www.sbrg.co.uk Scottish Borders Repeater Group</ref>\n\n== Repeater equipment ==\n[[Image:K2GXT 2M Repeater.jpg|thumb|2 Meter [[GE Mastr II]] repeater]]\n\nThe most basic repeater consists of an [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] receiver on one frequency and an FM transmitter on another frequency usually in the same radio band, connected together so that when the receiver picks up a signal, the transmitter is keyed and rebroadcasts whatever is heard.\n\nIn order to run the repeater a repeater controller is necessary. A repeater controller can be a hardware solution or even be implemented in software.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/svxlink/ SVX Link - A software solution for building repeaters.</ref>\n\nRepeaters typically have a timer to cut off retransmission of a signal that goes too long.  Repeaters operated by groups with an emphasis on emergency communications often limit each transmission to 30 seconds, while others may allow three minutes or even longer.  The timer restarts after a short pause following each transmission, and many systems feature a beep or chirp tone to signal that the timeout timer has reset.\n\n== Repeater types ==\n=== Conventional repeaters ===\nConventional repeaters, also known as in-band or same-band repeaters, retransmit signals within the same frequency [[Radio spectrum|band]], and they only repeat signals using a particular [[modulation]] scheme, predominately [[Frequency modulation|FM]].\n\nStandard repeaters require either the use of two antennas (one each for transmitter and receiver) or a [[duplexer]] to isolate the transmit and receive signals over a single antenna.  The duplexer is a device which prevents the repeater's high-power transmitter (on the output frequency) from drowning out the users' signal on the repeater receiver (on the input frequency). A ''diplexer'' allows two transmitters on different frequencies to use one antenna, and is common in installations where one repeater on 2 m and a second on 440&nbsp;MHz share one feedline up the tower and one antenna.\n\nMost repeaters are remotely controlled through the use of audio tones on a control channel.\n\n=== Cross-band repeaters ===\nA [[Crossband operation|cross-band]] repeater (also sometimes called a replexer), is a repeater that retransmits a specific mode on a frequency in one [[band (radio)|band]] to a specific mode on a frequency in a different band. This technique allows for a smaller and less complex repeater system. Repeating signals across widely separated frequency bands allows for simple filters to be used to allow one antenna to be used for both transmit and receive at the same time.  This avoids the use of complex duplexers to achieve the required rejection for same band repeating.\n\nSome dual-band amateur transceivers are capable of cross-band repeat.\n\n=== Amateur television repeaters ===\n[[Amateur television]] (ATV) repeaters are used by amateur radio operators to transmit full motion video. The bands used by ATV repeaters vary by country, but in the US a typical configuration is as a cross-band system with an input on the [[33 cm band|33]] or [[23 cm band]] and output on 421.25&nbsp;MHz or, sometimes, 426.25&nbsp;MHz (within the [[70 cm band]]). These output frequencies happen to be the same as standard [[cable television]] channels 57 and 58, meaning that anyone with a cable-ready analog [[NTSC]] TV can tune them in without special equipment.\n\nThere are also digital amateur TV repeaters that retransmit [[digital television|digital video]] signals.  Frequently [[DVB-S]] modulation is used for digital ATV, due to narrow bandwidth needs and high loss tolerances.  These DATV repeaters are more prevalent in Europe currently, partially because of the availability of DVB-S equipment.\n\n=== Satellite repeaters ===\n{{main article|amateur radio satellite}}\n\nIn addition, [[amateur radio satellite|amateur radio satellites]] have been launched with the specific purpose of operating as space-borne amateur repeaters.  The worldwide amateur satellite organization [[AMSAT]] designs and builds many of the amateur satellites, which are also known as [[OSCAR]]s.  Several satellites with amateur radio equipment on board have been designed and built by universities around the world.  Also, several OSCARs have been built for experimentation.  For example, [[NASA]] and [[AMSAT]] coordinated the release of [[SuitSat]] which was an attempt to make a low cost experimental satellite from a discarded Russian spacesuit outfitted with amateur radio equipment.\n\nThe repeaters on board a satellite may be of any type; the key distinction is that they are in orbit around the Earth, rather than terrestrial in nature.  The three most common types of OSCARs are linear transponders, cross-band FM repeaters, and digipeaters (also referred to as pacsats).\n\n=== Linear transponders ===\nAmateur [[transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]] repeaters are most commonly used on [[amateur satellite]]s.  A specified band of frequencies, usually having a bandwidth of 20 to 800&nbsp;kHz is repeated from one band to another.  Transponders are not mode specific and typically no [[demodulation]] occurs.  Any signal with a bandwidth narrower than the transponder's pass-band will be repeated; however, for technical reasons, use of modes other than [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] and [[Continuous wave|CW]] are discouraged.  Transponders may be inverting or non-inverting.  An example of an inverting transponder would be a [[70 centimeters|70cm]] to [[2 meters|2m]] transponder which receives on the 432.000&nbsp;MHz to 432.100&nbsp;MHz frequencies and transmits on the 146.000&nbsp;MHz to 146.100&nbsp;MHz frequencies by inverting the frequency range within the band.  In this example, a signal received at 432.001&nbsp;MHz would be transmitted on 146.099&nbsp;MHz.  Voice signals using [[upper sideband]] modulation on the input would result in a [[lower sideband|LSB]] modulation on the output, and vice versa.{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/HTML/p3d/|title=Phase 3D Satellite Primer}}\n\n=== Store-and-forward systems ===\nAnother class of repeaters do not simultaneously retransmit a signal, on different frequency, as they receive it.  Instead, they operate in a [[store-and-forward]] manner, by receiving and then retransmitting on the same frequency after a short delay.\n\nThese systems may not be legally classified as \"repeaters\", depending on the definition set by a country's regulator.  For example, in the US, the FCC defines a repeater as an \"amateur station that simultaneously retransmits the transmission of another amateur station on a different channel or channels.\" (CFR 47 97.205(b))  Store-and-forward systems neither retransmit simultaneously, nor use a different channel.  Thus, they must be operated under different rules than more conventional repeaters.\n\n==== Simplex repeater ====\nA type of system known as a ''simplex repeater'' uses a single transceiver and a short-duration voice recorder, which records whatever the receiver picks up for a set length of time (usually 30 seconds or less), then plays back the recording over the transmitter on the same frequency. A common name is a \"parrot\" repeater.\n\n==== Digipeater ====\nAnother form of repeater used in amateur [[packet radio]], a form of digital computer-to-computer communications, is dubbed \"digipeater\" (for ''DIGItal rePEATER).''  Digipeaters are often used for activities and modes such as packet radio, [[Automatic Packet Reporting System]], and [[D-STAR]]'s digital data mode. Also commercial digital modes such as DMR, P25 and NXDN. Some modes are full duplex and internet linked.\n\n==== SSTV repeater ====\nAn '''SSTV repeater''' is an [[amateur radio]] [[radio repeater|repeater station]] that relays [[slow-scan television]] signals. A typical SSTV repeater is equipped with a [[High frequency|HF]] or [[Very high frequency|VHF]] transceiver and a computer with a [[sound card]], which serves as a demodulator/modulator of SSTV signals.\n\nSSTV repeaters are used by amateur radio operators for exchanging pictures. If two stations cannot copy each other, they can still communicate through a repeater.\n\nOne type of SSTV repeater is activated by a station sending it a 1,750&nbsp;Hz tone. The repeater sends K in [[morse code]] to confirm its activation, after which the station must start sending a picture within about 10 seconds. After reception, the received image is transmitted on the repeater's operation frequency. Another type is activated by the SSTV vertical synchronization signal (VIS code).\n\nDepending on the software it uses (MMSSTV, JVComm32, MSCAN, for example), an SSTV repeater typically operates in common SSTV modes.\n\n== Repeater networks ==\nRepeaters may be linked together in order to form what is known as a ''linked repeater system'' or ''linked repeater network''.  In such a system, when one repeater is keyed-up by receiving a signal, all the other repeaters in the network are also activated and will transmit the same signal.  The connections between the repeaters are made via radio (usually on a different frequency from the published transmitting frequency) for maximum reliability.  Some networks have a feature to allow the user being able to turn additional repeaters and links on or off on the network. This feature is typically done with [[DTMF]] tones to control the network infrastructure.  Such a system allows coverage over a wide area, enabling communication between amateurs often hundreds of miles (several hundred km) apart.  These systems are used for area or regional communications, for example in [[Skywarn]] nets, where [[storm spotters]] relay [[severe weather]] reports.  All the user has to know is which channel to use in which area.\n\n=== Voting systems ===\nIn order to get better receive coverage over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with what is known as a ''voted receiver system''.  In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on).  All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting selector panel that switches from receiver to receiver  based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central repeater transmitter.  A properly adjusted [[Diversity combining|voting system]] can switch many times a second and can actually \"assemble\" a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise would not be able to key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue.  Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.\n\n=== Internet linking ===\nRepeaters may also be connected over the [[Internet]] using voice over IP ([[VoIP]]) techniques.  VoIP links are a convenient way to connecting distant repeaters that would otherwise be unreachable by VHF/UHF radio propagation.  Popular VoIP amateur radio network protocols include [[D-STAR]], [[Echolink]], [[IRLP]], [[Wide-Coverage Internet Repeater Enhancement System|WIRES]] and [[eQSO]]. Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), D-STAR, Fusion, P25 and NXDN all have a codec in the user radio and along with the encoded audio, also send and receive user number and destination information so one can talk to another specific user or a Talk Group. Two such worldwide networks are DMR-MARC and Brandmeister.\n\nFor example, a [[simplex|''simplex gateway'']] may be used to link a simplex repeater into a repeater network via the Internet.\n\n== Operating terms ==\n* '''Timing Out''' is the situation where a person talks too long and the repeater timer shuts off the repeater transmitter.\n* '''Kerchunking''' is transmitting a momentary signal to check a [[repeater]] without identifying.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Ham's Guide to Repeaters|url=http://www.arrl.org/FandES/ead/materials/Repeater.ppt|website=Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL)|accessdate=18 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126232149/http://www.arrl.org/FandES/ead/materials/Repeater.ppt|archivedate=26 January 2009}}</ref> In many countries, such an act violates amateur radio regulations. The term \"Kerchunk\" can also apply to the sound a large FM transmitter makes when the operator switches it off and on.\n* '''Lid''' refers to a poor operator (radio methods) usually from improper training from other Amateurs or exposure to different types of operation such as [[CB radio]].\n\n== Repeater listings ==\nSeveral resources exist to list repeaters. [[RFinder]] has one such service, the World Wide Repeater Directory, which has over 50,000 repeater listings from over 170 countries.<ref name=\"RFinderARRL\">http://www.arrl.org/news/view/arrl-announces-partnership-with-rfinder-the-worldwide-repeater-directory</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Amateur radio repeaters}}\n* [http://www.repeater-builder.com Free information web site devoted to those that build repeaters of any type: amateur, commercial, GMRS, public safety, etc.]\n\n{{AmateurRadioBands-VHFUHF}}\n{{Two-way radio}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amateur Radio Repeater}}\n[[Category:Amateur radio|Repeater]]\n[[Category:Radio electronics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n[[Image:K2GXT 70cm repeater APRS IRLP.JPG|thumb|200px|An amateur radio repeater system consisting of a 70cm repeater and a 2-meter digipeater and iGate.]]\n[[Image:Tuning The Cans.jpg|thumb|200px|Coaxial cavity RF filter at 2 meter repeater]]\n\nAn '''amateur radio repeater''' is an electronic device that receives a weak or low-level [[amateur radio]] signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation.

Systems with autopatches frequently had (and still have) most of the public safety agencies numbers programmed as speed-dial numbers.\n\n=== US repeater coordination ===\nRepeater coordination is not required by the Federal Communications Commission, nor does the FCC regulate, certify or otherwise regulate frequency coordination for the Amateur Radio Bands.\n\nAmateur Radio Repeater Coordinators or coordination groups are all volunteers and have no legal authority to assume jurisdictional or regional control in any area where the Federal Communications Commission regulates the Amateur Radio Service.   The United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 CFR, Part 97, which are the laws in which the Amateur Radio Service is regulated clearly states the definition of Frequency Coordinator.\n\nThe purpose of coordinating a repeater or frequency is to reduce harmful interference to other fixed operations.   Coordinating a repeater or frequency with other fixed operations demonstrates good engineering and amateur practice.\n\n=== UK repeaters ===\nIn the UK, the frequency allocations for repeaters are managed by the [[Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee (ETCC)]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrepeater.net|title=ukrepeaters|author=|date=|website=www.ukrepeater.net|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] and licensed by [[Ofcom]], the industry regulator for communications in the UK. Each repeater has a NOV (Notice of Variation) licence issued to a particular amateur radio callsign (this person is normally known as the \"repeater keeper\") thus ensuring the licensing authority has a single point of contact for that particular repeater.\n\nEach repeater in the UK is normally supported by a repeater group composed of local amateur radio enthusiasts who pay a nominal amount e.g. \u00a310\u201315 a year each to support the maintenance of each repeater and to pay for site rents, electricity costs etc. Repeater groups do not receive any central funding from other organisations.\n\nSuch groups include the [[Central Scotland FM Group]]<ref>http://www.csfmg.com Central Scotland FM Group</ref> and the [[Scottish Borders Repeater Group]].<ref>http://www.sbrg.co.uk Scottish Borders Repeater Group</ref>\n\n== Repeater equipment ==\n[[Image:K2GXT 2M Repeater.jpg|thumb|2 Meter [[GE Mastr II]] repeater]]\n\nThe most basic repeater consists of an [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] receiver on one frequency and an FM transmitter on another frequency usually in the same radio band, connected together so that when the receiver picks up a signal, the transmitter is keyed and rebroadcasts whatever is heard.\n\nIn order to run the repeater a repeater controller is necessary. A repeater controller can be a hardware solution or even be implemented in software.<ref>http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/svxlink/ SVX Link - A software solution for building repeaters.</ref>\n\nRepeaters typically have a timer to cut off retransmission of a signal that goes too long.  Repeaters operated by groups with an emphasis on emergency communications often limit each transmission to 30 seconds, while others may allow three minutes or even longer.  The timer restarts after a short pause following each transmission, and many systems feature a beep or chirp tone to signal that the timeout timer has reset.\n\n== Repeater types ==\n=== Conventional repeaters ===\nConventional repeaters, also known as in-band or same-band repeaters, retransmit signals within the same frequency [[Radio spectrum|band]], and they only repeat signals using a particular [[modulation]] scheme, predominately [[Frequency modulation|FM]].\n\nStandard repeaters require either the use of two antennas (one each for transmitter and receiver) or a [[duplexer]] to isolate the transmit and receive signals over a single antenna.  The duplexer is a device which prevents the repeater's high-power transmitter (on the output frequency) from drowning out the users' signal on the repeater receiver (on the input frequency). A ''diplexer'' allows two transmitters on different frequencies to use one antenna, and is common in installations where one repeater on 2 m and a second on 440&nbsp;MHz share one feedline up the tower and one antenna.\n\nMost repeaters are remotely controlled through the use of audio tones on a control channel.\n\n=== Cross-band repeaters ===\nA [[Crossband operation|cross-band]] repeater (also sometimes called a replexer), is a repeater that retransmits a specific mode on a frequency in one [[band (radio)|band]] to a specific mode on a frequency in a different band. This technique allows for a smaller and less complex repeater system. Repeating signals across widely separated frequency bands allows for simple filters to be used to allow one antenna to be used for both transmit and receive at the same time.  This avoids the use of complex duplexers to achieve the required rejection for same band repeating.\n\nSome dual-band amateur transceivers are capable of cross-band repeat.\n\n=== Amateur television repeaters ===\n[[Amateur television]] (ATV) repeaters are used by amateur radio operators to transmit full motion video. The bands used by ATV repeaters vary by country, but in the US a typical configuration is as a cross-band system with an input on the [[33 cm band|33]] or [[23 cm band]] and output on 421.25&nbsp;MHz or, sometimes, 426.25&nbsp;MHz (within the [[70 cm band]]). These output frequencies happen to be the same as standard [[cable television]] channels 57 and 58, meaning that anyone with a cable-ready analog [[NTSC]] TV can tune them in without special equipment.\n\nThere are also digital amateur TV repeaters that retransmit [[digital television|digital video]] signals.  Frequently [[DVB-S]] modulation is used for digital ATV, due to narrow bandwidth needs and high loss tolerances.  These DATV repeaters are more prevalent in Europe currently, partially because of the availability of DVB-S equipment.\n\n=== Satellite repeaters ===\n{{main article|amateur radio satellite}}\n\nIn addition, amateur radio satellites have been launched with the specific purpose of operating as space-borne amateur repeaters.  The worldwide amateur satellite organization [[AMSAT]] designs and builds many of the amateur satellites, which are also known as [[OSCAR]]s.  Several satellites with amateur radio equipment on board have been designed and built by universities around the world.  Also, several OSCARs have been built for experimentation.  For example, [[NASA]] and [[AMSAT]] coordinated the release of [[SuitSat]] which was an attempt to make a low cost experimental satellite from a discarded Russian spacesuit outfitted with amateur radio equipment.\n\nThe repeaters on board a satellite may be of any type; the key distinction is that they are in orbit around the Earth, rather than terrestrial in nature.  The three most common types of OSCARs are linear transponders, cross-band FM repeaters, and digipeaters (also referred to as pacsats).\n\n=== Linear transponders ===\nAmateur [[transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]] repeaters are most commonly used on [[amateur satellite]]s.  A specified band of frequencies, usually having a bandwidth of 20 to 800&nbsp;kHz is repeated from one band to another.  Transponders are not mode specific and typically no [[demodulation]] occurs.  Any signal with a bandwidth narrower than the transponder's pass-band will be repeated; however, for technical reasons, use of modes other than [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] and [[Continuous wave|CW]] are discouraged.  Transponders may be inverting or non-inverting.  An example of an inverting transponder would be a [[70 centimeters|70cm]] to [[2 meters|2m]] transponder which receives on the 432.000&nbsp;MHz to 432.100&nbsp;MHz frequencies and transmits on the 146.000&nbsp;MHz to 146.100&nbsp;MHz frequencies by inverting the frequency range within the band.  In this example, a signal received at 432.001&nbsp;MHz would be transmitted on 146.099&nbsp;MHz.  Voice signals using [[upper sideband]] modulation on the input would result in a [[lower sideband|LSB]] modulation on the output, and vice versa.{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/HTML/p3d/|title=Phase 3D Satellite Primer}}\n\n=== Store-and-forward systems ===\nAnother class of repeaters do not simultaneously retransmit a signal, on different frequency, as they receive it.  Instead, they operate in a [[store-and-forward]] manner, by receiving and then retransmitting on the same frequency after a short delay.\n\nThese systems may not be legally classified as \"repeaters\", depending on the definition set by a country's regulator.  For example, in the US, the FCC defines a repeater as an \"amateur station that simultaneously retransmits the transmission of another amateur station on a different channel or channels.\" (CFR 47 97.205(b))  Store-and-forward systems neither retransmit simultaneously, nor use a different channel.  Thus, they must be operated under different rules than more conventional repeaters.\n\n==== Simplex repeater ====\nA type of system known as a ''simplex repeater'' uses a single transceiver and a short-duration voice recorder, which records whatever the receiver picks up for a set length of time (usually 30 seconds or less), then plays back the recording over the transmitter on the same frequency. A common name is a \"parrot\" repeater.\n\n==== Digipeater ====\nAnother form of repeater used in amateur [[packet radio]], a form of digital computer-to-computer communications, is dubbed \"digipeater\" (for ''DIGItal rePEATER).''  Digipeaters are often used for activities and modes such as packet radio, [[Automatic Packet Reporting System]], and [[D-STAR]]'s digital data mode. Also commercial digital modes such as DMR, P25 and NXDN. Some modes are full duplex and internet linked.\n\n==== SSTV repeater ====\nAn '''SSTV repeater''' is an [[amateur radio]] [[radio repeater|repeater station]] that relays [[slow-scan television]] signals. A typical SSTV repeater is equipped with a [[High frequency|HF]] or [[Very high frequency|VHF]] transceiver and a computer with a [[sound card]], which serves as a demodulator/modulator of SSTV signals.\n\nSSTV repeaters are used by amateur radio operators for exchanging pictures. If two stations cannot copy each other, they can still communicate through a repeater.\n\nOne type of SSTV repeater is activated by a station sending it a 1,750&nbsp;Hz tone. The repeater sends K in [[morse code]] to confirm its activation, after which the station must start sending a picture within about 10 seconds. After reception, the received image is transmitted on the repeater's operation frequency. Another type is activated by the SSTV vertical synchronization signal (VIS code).\n\nDepending on the software it uses (MMSSTV, JVComm32, MSCAN, for example), an SSTV repeater typically operates in common SSTV modes.\n\n== Repeater networks ==\nRepeaters may be linked together in order to form what is known as a ''linked repeater system'' or ''linked repeater network''.  In such a system, when one repeater is keyed-up by receiving a signal, all the other repeaters in the network are also activated and will transmit the same signal.  The connections between the repeaters are made via radio (usually on a different frequency from the published transmitting frequency) for maximum reliability.  Some networks have a feature to allow the user being able to turn additional repeaters and links on or off on the network. This feature is typically done with [[DTMF]] tones to control the network infrastructure.  Such a system allows coverage over a wide area, enabling communication between amateurs often hundreds of miles (several hundred km) apart.  These systems are used for area or regional communications, for example in [[Skywarn]] nets, where [[storm spotters]] relay [[severe weather]] reports.  All the user has to know is which channel to use in which area.\n\n=== Voting systems ===\nIn order to get better receive coverage over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with what is known as a ''voted receiver system''.  In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on).  All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting selector panel that switches from receiver to receiver  based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central repeater transmitter.  A properly adjusted [[Diversity combining|voting system]] can switch many times a second and can actually \"assemble\" a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise would not be able to key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue.  Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.\n\n=== Internet linking ===\nRepeaters may also be connected over the [[Internet]] using voice over IP ([[VoIP]]) techniques.  VoIP links are a convenient way to connecting distant repeaters that would otherwise be unreachable by VHF/UHF radio propagation.  Popular VoIP amateur radio network protocols include [[D-STAR]], [[Echolink]], [[IRLP]], [[Wide-Coverage Internet Repeater Enhancement System|WIRES]] and [[eQSO]]. Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), D-STAR, Fusion, P25 and NXDN all have a codec in the user radio and along with the encoded audio, also send and receive user number and destination information so one can talk to another specific user or a Talk Group. Two such worldwide networks are DMR-MARC and Brandmeister.\n\nFor example, a [[simplex|''simplex gateway'']] may be used to link a simplex repeater into a repeater network via the Internet.\n\n== Operating terms ==\n* '''Timing Out''' is the situation where a person talks too long and the repeater timer shuts off the repeater transmitter.\n* '''Kerchunking''' is transmitting a momentary signal to check a [[repeater]] without identifying.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Ham's Guide to Repeaters|url=http://www.arrl.org/FandES/ead/materials/Repeater.ppt|website=Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL)|accessdate=18 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126232149/http://www.arrl.org/FandES/ead/materials/Repeater.ppt|archivedate=26 January 2009}}</ref> In many countries, such an act violates amateur radio regulations. The term \"Kerchunk\" can also apply to the sound a large FM transmitter makes when the operator switches it off and on.\n* '''Lid''' refers to a poor operator (radio methods) usually from improper training from other Amateurs or exposure to different types of operation such as [[CB radio]].\n\n== Repeater listings ==\nSeveral resources exist to list repeaters. [[RFinder]] has one such service, the World Wide Repeater Directory, which has over 50,000 repeater listings from over 170 countries.<ref name=\"RFinderARRL\">http://www.arrl.org/news/view/arrl-announces-partnership-with-rfinder-the-worldwide-repeater-directory</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Amateur radio repeaters}}\n* [http://www.repeater-builder.com Free information web site devoted to those that build repeaters of any type: amateur, commercial, GMRS, public safety, etc.]\n\n{{AmateurRadioBands-VHFUHF}}\n{{Two-way radio}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amateur Radio Repeater}}\n[[Category:Amateur radio|Repeater]]\n[[Category:Radio electronics]]\n", "name_user": "Stickymatch", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSatellite repeaters", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_repeater"}

The patient may feel pain at this apex, which can be aggravated by physical activity and by long periods of standing or sitting. This can have a significantly detrimental effect on their lives, as their level of activity is curbed by their condition; they may feel isolated or uneasy amongst peers if they are children, depending on the level of deformity. Whereas in postural kyphosis, the vertebrae and discs appear normal, in Scheuermann\u2019s kyphosis, they are irregular, often herniated, and wedge-shaped over at least three adjacent levels. [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]] is a very common symptom, most likely because of the intense muscle work that has to be put into standing or sitting properly. The condition appears to run in families. Most patients who undergo surgery to correct their kyphosis have Scheuermann's disease.\n* '''Congenital kyphosis''' (Q76.4) can result in infants whose spinal column has not developed correctly in the womb.

Idiopathic causes, such as vertebral wedging or other abnormalities, can be confirmed through X-ray. Osteoporosis, a potential cause of kyphosis, can be confirmed with a [[bone density]] scan. Postural thoracic kyphosis can often be treated with posture reeducation and focused strengthening exercises. Idiopathic thoracic kyphosis due to vertebral wedging, fractures, or vertebral abnormalities is more difficult to manage, since assuming a correct posture may not be possible with structural changes in the vertebrae. Children who have not completed their growth may show long-lasting improvements with bracing. Exercises may be prescribed to alleviate discomfort associated with overstretched back muscles. A variety of gravity-assisted positions or gentle traction can minimize pain associated with [[nerve root]] impingement.

Scheuermann's kyphosis is considered a form of juvenile [[osteochondrosis]] of the spine, and is more commonly called Scheuermann's disease. It is found mostly in teenagers and presents a significantly worse deformity than postural kyphosis.

The patient may feel pain at this apex, which can be aggravated by physical activity and by long periods of standing or sitting. This can have a significantly detrimental effect on their lives, as their level of activity is curbed by their condition; they may feel isolated or uneasy amongst peers if they are children, depending on the level of deformity. Whereas in postural kyphosis, the vertebrae and discs appear normal, in Scheuermann\u2019s kyphosis, they are irregular, often herniated, and wedge-shaped over at least three adjacent levels. [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]] is a very common symptom, most likely because of the intense muscle work that has to be put into standing or sitting properly. The condition appears to run in families. Most patients who undergo surgery to correct their kyphosis have Scheuermann's disease.\n* '''Congenital kyphosis''' (Q76.4) can result in infants whose spinal column has not developed correctly in the womb.

However, the decision to carry out the procedure can be very difficult due to the potential risks to the child. A congenital kyphosis can also suddenly appear in teenage years, more commonly in children with cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders.\n* '''Nutritional kyphosis''' can result from [[malnutrition|nutritional deficiencies]], especially during childhood, such as [[vitamin D deficiency]] (producing [[rickets]]), which softens bones and results in curving of the spine and limbs under the child's body weight.\n* '''[[Gibbus deformity]]''' is a form of structural kyphosis, often a ''sequela'' to [[tuberculosis]].\n* '''Post-traumatic kyphosis''' (M84.0) can arise from untreated or ineffectively treated vertebral fractures.\n\n===Grading===\n[[File:Sagittal balance.png|thumb|Sagittal balance measurement.<ref name=\"Tebet2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Tebet|first1=Marcos Antonio|title=Conceitos atuais sobre equil\u00edbrio sagital e classifica\u00e7\u00e3o da espondil\u00f3lise e espondilolistese |journal=Revista Brasileira de Ortopedia |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=2014 |pages=3\u201312 |issn=0102-3616 |doi=10.1016/j.rbo.2013.04.011|pmid=26229765|pmc=4511775}}</ref>]]\nKyphosis can be graded in severity by the [[Cobb angle]]. Also, ''sagittal balance'' can be measured.

Idiopathic causes, such as vertebral wedging or other abnormalities, can be confirmed through X-ray. Osteoporosis, a potential cause of kyphosis, can be confirmed with a [[bone density]] scan. Postural thoracic kyphosis can often be treated with posture reeducation and focused strengthening exercises. Idiopathic thoracic kyphosis due to vertebral wedging, fractures, or vertebral abnormalities is more difficult to manage, since assuming a correct posture may not be possible with structural changes in the vertebrae. Children who have not completed their growth may show long-lasting improvements with bracing. Exercises may be prescribed to alleviate discomfort associated with overstretched back muscles. A variety of gravity-assisted positions or gentle traction can minimize pain associated with [[nerve root]] impingement. Surgery may be recommended for severe [[wikt:idiopathic|idiopathic]] kyphosis.\n\n===Brace===\n[[Image:kyphosis brace1.jpg|thumb|Modern brace for the treatment of a thoracic kyphosis.

is a [[Saint Lucia]]n [[cricket]]er who played international cricket for the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. He is also an honorary Pakistani citizen. He is a two time [[ICC World Twenty20|T20 World Cup]] winning captain. On making his [[One-Day International]] (ODI) debut against Bangladesh in 2004, Sammy became the first person from the island of St Lucia to play international cricket.
