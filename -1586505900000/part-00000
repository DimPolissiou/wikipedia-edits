{"title_page": "Coalition government", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of government}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2010}}\n{{politics}}\nA '''coalition government''' is a form of government in which political parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that \"coalition\". The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the [[election]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis (for example, during wartime or economic crisis) to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] or [[collective identity]], it can also play a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed all-party coalitions ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.\n\n==Practice==\n{{original research section|date=June 2009}}\nWhen a general election does not produce a clear majority for a single party, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a group of parties that command a majority in parliament tend to be more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of no confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{see also|List of countries with coalition governments}}\nCountries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kosovo]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Switzerland]] has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the \"[[Magic Formula]]\". Between 2010 and 2015, the [[United Kingdom]] also operated a formal coalition between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties, but this was unusual: the UK usually has a single-party majority government.\n\n===Coalitions composed of few parties===\n{{party politics}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n\n{{see also|National Government (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom coalition government (disambiguation)}}\nIn the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], coalition governments (sometimes known as \"national governments\") usually have only been formed at times of national crisis. The most prominent was the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both [[world war]]s. Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function: for instance the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] formed [[Lib-Lab pact|a pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] from March 1977 until July 1978, after a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labour's majority of three seats which had been gained at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]]. However, in the run-up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Labour opposition leader [[Tony Blair]] was in talks with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Paddy Ashdown]] about forming a coalition government if Labour failed to win a majority at the election; but there proved to be no need for a coalition as Labour won the election by a [[landslide victory|landslide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work:Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> The [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] (Britain's first for [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], led by [[David Cameron]], which had won the largest number of seats, formed a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to gain a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/05/lib-dems-government-deal|title=Tories and Lib Dems enter full coalition government|magazine=The New Statesman}}</ref> It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition,<ref>Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, [[David Cameron]] on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill (1949) ''Their Finest Hour''.</ref>\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have entered into a coalition twice in the [[Scottish Parliament]], as well as twice in the [[Welsh Assembly]].\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] together with their partners the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CDU/CSU), or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example, [[Helmut Kohl]]'s CDU governed for years in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s SPD was in power with the [[German Green Party|Greens]]; and from 2009 [[Angela Merkel]], CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.\n\n\"Grand coalitions\" of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare, as large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early [[2005 German federal election|elections]], the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellery]] while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts. Parties frequently make statements ahead of elections which coalitions they categorically reject, similar to election promises or shadow cabinets in other countries.\n\nIn Germany, coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties (CDU and CSU, two allies which always form a single [[caucus]], are in this regard considered a single party). However, in the 2010s coalitions on the state level increasingly included three different parties, often [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Greens and one of the major parties or \"red red green\" coalitions of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Linkspartei]] and Greens. By 2016, the Greens have joined governments on the state level in eleven coalitions in seven various constellations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://eu.boell.org/sites/default/files/greens_in_government.pdf|title=German Greens in Coalition Governments. A Political Analysis.|last=Jungjohann|first=Arne|publisher=Heinrich-B\u00f6ll-Stiftung European Union and Green European Foundation|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=19}}</ref>\n\n===Examples of coalitions===\n\n====Armenia====\n[[Armenia]] became an independent state in 1991, following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since then, many political parties were formed in it, who mainly work with each other to form coalition governments. Currently the country is governed by the [[My Step Alliance]] coalition after successfully gaining a majority in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] following the [[2018 Armenian parliamentary election]].\n\n====Australia====\nIn federal [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]], the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]], [[National Party of Australia|National]], [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] and [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] parties are united in a coalition, known simply as [[Coalition (Australia)|the Coalition]]. The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a [[two-party system|two-party]] house, with the Coalition and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] being the major parties. This coalition is also found in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] the Liberal and National parties compete separately, while in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] the two parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party, in 1978, and the Liberal National Party, in 2008, respectively.\n\nThe other federal coalition has been:\n*[[United Australia Party|United Australia]]\u2013[[National Country Party|Country]]\u2013Independents coalition in [[1940 Australian federal election|1940]]\n*In [[Tasmanian Government|Tasmania]]:\n**Liberal\u2013Greens coalition in [[1996 Tasmanian state election|1996]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions formed in [[1989 Tasmanian state election|1989]] and [[2010 Tasmanian state election|2010]].\n*In the [[ACT Government|Australian Capital Territory]]:\n**Liberal\u2013[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] coalition in [[1998 Australian Capital Territory general election|1998]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions in [[2001 Australian Capital Territory general election|2001]] and [[2008 Australian Capital Territory general election|2008]].\n\n====Belgium====\nIn [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], where there are separate [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking and [[French language|French]]-speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are common.\n\n====Canada====\nIn [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], the [[Great Coalition]] was formed in 1864 by the [[Clear Grits]], [[Parti bleu]], and [[Liberal-Conservative Party]]. During the [[First World War]], Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/precedents-from-around-the-world-1.876563|title=Coalition Government: Precedents from around the world|publisher=CBC News|date=2010-05-13|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[1919 Ontario general election|1919 Ontario election]], the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] and the [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour Party]], together with three independent MLAs, formed a coalition that governed [[Ontario]] until 1923.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], the governing Liberals formed a coalition with the opposition Conservatives in order to prevent the surging, left-wing [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] from taking power in the [[1941 British Columbia general election]]. Liberal premier [[Duff Pattullo]] refused to form a coalition with the third-place Conservatives, so his party removed him. The Liberal\u2013Conservative coalition introduced a winner-take-all preferential voting system (the \"[[Alternative Vote]]\") in the hopes that their supporters would rank the other party as their second preference; however, this strategy did not take CCF second preferences into account. In the [[1952 British Columbia general election]], to the surprise of many, the right-wing populist [[BC Social Credit Party]] won a minority. They were able to win a majority in the subsequent election as Liberal and Conservative supporters shifted their anti-CCF vote to Social Credit.\n\nManitoba has had more formal coalition governments than any other province. Following gains by the United Farmer's/Progressive movement elsewhere in the country, the [[United Farmers of Manitoba]] unexpectedly won the 1921 election. Like their counterparts in Ontario, they had not expected to win and did not have a leader. They asked [[John Bracken]], a professor in animal husbandry, to become leader and premier. Bracken changed the party's name to the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]]. During the Great Depression, Bracken survived at a time when other premiers were being defeated by forming a coalition government with the Manitoba Liberals (eventually, the two parties would merge into the [[Manitoba Liberal Party#Liberal-Progressive Party: Merger with the Progressives|Liberal-Progressive Party of Manitoba]], and decades later, the party would change its name to the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]]). In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government with almost every party in the Manitoba Legislature (the Conservatives, CCF, and Social Credit; however, the CCF broke with the coalition after a few years over policy differences). The only party not included was the small, communist [[Labor-Progressive Party]], which had a handful of seats.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, NDP premier [[Roy Romanow]] formed a formal coalition with the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party|Saskatchewan Liberals]] in 1999 after being reduced to a minority. After two years, the newly elected Liberal leader David Karwacki  ordered the coalition be disbanded, the Liberal caucus disagreed with him and left the Liberals to run as New Democrats in the upcoming election. The [[Saskatchewan NDP]] was re-elected with a majority under its new leader [[Lorne Calvert]], while the Saskatchewan Liberals lost their remaining seats and have not been competitive in the province since.\n\nAccording to historian [[Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)|Christopher Moore]], coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. Such a manner of leadership election had never been tried in any parliamentary system before. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely.<ref name=Moore-1>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Christopher|year=2011|title=Come together|journal=[[Canada's History]]|issue=June\u2013July 2011|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008\u201309 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], two of Canada's opposition parties signed an agreement to form what would become the country's second coalition government since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] if the minority Conservative government was defeated on a vote of non-confidence,<ref>{{cite news|title=Coalition Set To Topple Canada PM|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122818032317670973?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-02|author=Menon, Nirmala}}</ref> unseating [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. The [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and the coalition dispersed before parliament was reconvened.\n\n====Denmark====\nFrom the creation of the [[Folketing]] in 1849 through the introduction of [[proportional representation]] in 1918, there were only single-party governments in Denmark. [[Thorvald Stauning]] formed his [[Stauning II Cabinet|second government]] and Denmark's first coalition government in 1929. With the exception of a string of one-party governments during the 1970s, the norm since 1929 has been coalition governments. Every government from 1982 until the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 elections]] were coalitions. The most recent coalition was [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen III Cabinet|L\u00f8kke's third government]], which was replaced by the one-party [[Frederiksen Cabinet|Frederiksen government]] in 2019.\n\nWhen the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] under Stauning won 46% of the votes in the [[1935 Danish Folketing election|1935 election]], this was the closest any party has gotten to winning an outright majority in parliament. One party has thus never held a majority alone, and even one-party governments since 1918 have needed the [[Confidence and supply|support]] of at least one other party to govern. For example, the current government consists only of the Social Democrats, but also relies on the support of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], and the [[Red\u2013Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red\u2013Green Alliance]].\n\n====Finland====\nIn [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government ([[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|Lipponen I]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second cabinet|II]]) since [[Finland's declaration of independence|independence]] with a five-party governing coalition, a so-called \"rainbow government\". The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record and were unusual in the respect that both the centre-left (SDP) and radical left-wing (Left Alliance) parties sat in the government with the major centre-right party (National Coalition). The [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|Katainen cabinet]] was also a rainbow coalition of a total of five parties.\n\n====India====\nSince India's Independence on 15 August 1947, [[Indian National Congress]], the major political party instrumental in [[Indian independence movement]], ruled the nation. The first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], second PM [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and the third PM [[Indira Gandhi]], all were from the Congress party. However, [[Raj Narain]], who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of [[Rae Bareilly]] in 1971, lodged a case, alleging electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security. The [[1977 Indian general election|next election's result]] was that [[Politics of India|India]]'s first-ever coalition government was formed at the national level under the Prime Ministership of [[Morarji Desai]], which was also the first non-Congress national government, which existed from 24 March 1977 to 15 July 1979, headed by the [[Janata Party]],<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite news|title=OBITUARY: Morarji Desai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-morarji-desai-1615165.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|author=Kuldip Singh|date=1995-04-11|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> an amalgam of political parties opposed to Emergency imposed between 1975 and 1977. As the popularity of Janata Party dwindled, Morarji Desai had to resign and [[Charan Singh]], a rival of Desai became the fifth PM. However, due to lack of support, this coalition government did not complete its five-year term.\n\nCongress returned to the power in 1980 under Indira Gandhi, and later under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as the 6th PM. However, the next [[1989 Indian general election|general election of 1989]] once again brought a coalition government under [[National Front (India)|National Front]], which lasted until 1991, with two Prime Ministers, the second one being supported by Congress. The 1991 election resulted in a Congress led stable [[minority government]] for five years. The next 11th [[Lok Sabha|parliament]] produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998. The first successful coalition government in India which completed the whole 5-year term was the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] as PM from 1999 to 2004. Then another coalition, Congress led [[United Progressive Alliance]], consisting of 13 separate parties ruled India for two terms from 2004 to 2014 with [[Manmohan Singh]] as PM. However, in the [[2014 Indian general election|16th general election]] in May 2014, BJP secured majority on its own (first party to do so since 1984 election) and National Democratic Alliance came into power, with [[Narendra Modi]] as Prime Minister. In 2019, Narendra Modi got re-elected as Prime Minister for the second time as National Democratic Alliance again secured majority in the [[2019 Indian general election|17th general election]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nAs a result of the [[Fall of Suharto|toppling of Suharto]], political freedom is significantly increased. Compared to only three parties allowed to exist in the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, a total of 48 political parties participated in the [[1999 Indonesian legislative election|1999 election]], a total of 24 parties in the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|2004 election]], 38 parties in the [[2009 Indonesian legislative election|2009 election]], and 15 parties in the [[2014 Indonesian legislative election|2014 election]]. There are no majority winner of those elections and coalition governments are inevitable. The current government is a coalition of seven parties led by the [[Indonesian Democratic Party \u2013 Struggle|PDIP]] and [[Party of the Functional Groups|Golkar]].\n\n====Ireland====\nIn [[Republic of Ireland]], coalition governments are quite common; not since 1977 has a single party been able to form a majority government. Coalitions are the typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of a minority Fine Gael government, supported by a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement with Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nIreland's first coalition government was formed in [[1948 Irish general election|1948]]. Ireland has had consecutive coalition governments since the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 general election]], excluding two brief Fianna F\u00e1il minority administrations in 1994 and 2011 that followed the withdrawal of their coalition partners from government. Before 1989, Fianna F\u00e1il had opposed participation in coalition governments, preferring single-party minority government instead.\n\nIrish coalition governments have traditionally been based on one of two large blocs in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]: either Fianna F\u00e1il in coalition with smaller parties or independents, or Fine Gael and the Labour Party in coalition, sometimes with smaller parties. The only exception to these traditional alliances was the [[23rd Government of Ireland]], comprising Fianna F\u00e1il and the Labour Party, which ruled between 1993 and 1994. The [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il]], though a traditional Fine Gael\u2013Labour coalition, resembles a [[grand coalition]], due to the collapse of the Fianna F\u00e1il to third place among parties in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n====Israel====\nA similar situation exists in [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], which typically has at least 10 parties holding representation in the [[Knesset]]. The only faction to ever gain the majority of Knesset seats was [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], an alliance of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and [[Mapam]] that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968 to 1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing [[Likud]] in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties. [[Ariel Sharon]]'s formation of the centrist [[Kadima]] party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.\n\nIsrael also formed a [[national unity government]] from [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984\u20131988]]. The premiership and foreign ministry portfolio were held by the head of each party for two years, and they switched roles in 1986.\n\n====Japan====\nPost-World War II [[Politics of Japan|Japan]] has historically been dominated by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], but there was a brief coalition government formed after the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 election]] following LDP's first loss of its overall [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] majority since 1955, winning only 223 out of 511 seats. The LDP government was replaced by an eight-party coalition government, which consisted of all of the previous opposition parties excluding the [[Japanese Communist Party]], who together controlled 243 seats. Every Japanese government since then has been a coalition government in one way or another.\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{Main|Electoral system of New Zealand#MMP in New Zealand}}\n[[MMP representation|MMP]] was introduced in [[New Zealand]] in [[1996 New Zealand general election|the 1996 election]]. \nIn order to get into power, parties need to get a total of 50% of the 121 seats in parliament \u2013 61. Since no parties have ever gotten a full majority, they must form coalitions with other parties. For example, during the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] got 46 seats and [[New Zealand First]] got nine. The two formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Coalition Government]] with [[confidence and supply]] from the [[Green Party (New Zealand)|Green Party]] which got eight seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/full-video-nz-first-leader-winston-peters-announces-next-government.html |title=Full video: NZ First leader Winston Peters announces next Government |author=Chapman, Grant |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/an-historic-moment-for-the-green-party-james-shaw.html |title=An 'historic moment' for the Green Party \u2013 James Shaw |author=Hurley, Emma |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Spain ====\nSince 2015, there are coalition governments in municipalities, autonomous regions and, since 2020 (coming from the [[November 2019 Spanish general election]]), in the Spanish Government. There are two ways of conforming them: all of them based on a program and its institutional architecture, one consists on distributing the different areas of government between the parties conforming the coalition and the other one is, like in the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web |title=Generalitat Valenciana's political structure |website=gvaoberta.gva.es |url=http://www.gvaoberta.gva.es/es/estructura-organica |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> where the ministries are structured with members of all the political parties being represented, so that conflicts that may occur are regarding competences and not fights between parties.\n\n==== Uruguay ====\n\nSince the [[1989 Uruguayan general election|1989 election]], there have been 4 coalition governments, all including at least both the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] and the liberal [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]]. The first one was after the election of the blanco [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] and lasted until 1992 due to policy disagreements, the longest lasting coalition was the Colorado-led coalition under the second government of [[Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti]], in which the national leader [[Alberto Volont\u00e9]] was frequently described as a \"Prime Minister\", the next coalition (under president [[Jorge Batlle]]) was also Colorado-led, but it lasted only until after the [[2002 Uruguay banking crisis]], when the blancos abandoned the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/lacalle-herrera-batlle-gobernar-coalicion.html|title=De Lacalle Herrera a Batlle: c\u00f3mo gobernar en coalici\u00f3n|last=ElPais|website=Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|language=spanish|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> After the [[2019 Uruguayan general election]], the blanco [[Luis Lacalle Pou]] formed the [[Coalici\u00f3n Multicolor|coalici\u00f3n multicolor]], composed of his own National Party, the liberal Colorado Party, the right wing populist [[Open Cabildo (Uruguay)|Open Cabildo]] and the center left [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/es/los-desaf%C3%ADos-de-lacalle-el-nuevo-presidente-del-pa%C3%ADs-m%C3%A1s-estable-de-latinoam%C3%A9rica/a-51477669|title=Los desaf\u00edos de Lacalle, el nuevo presidente del pa\u00eds m\u00e1s estable de Latinoam\u00e9rica {{!}} DW {{!}} 29.11.2019|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nAdvocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising differing parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the [[Constituency|electorate]] within a country.<ref name=\"Moore-1\"/>\n\nThose who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moury |first1=Catherine |last2=Timmermans |first2=Arco |title=Inter-party conflict management in coalition governments: Analyzing the role of coalition agreements in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands |journal=Politics and Governance |date=25 July 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013131 |doi=10.17645/pag.v1i2.94 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/94 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in [[Flanders]] or [[Northern Ireland]]. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play \"[[kingmaker]]\" and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.\n\nCoalition governments have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2014}} for sustaining a [[consensus]] on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals \u2014 even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.\n\nPowerful parties can also act in an [[Oligocracy|oligocratic]] way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to [[two-party system]]s, which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory [[nomination rules]] regulations and [[plurality voting system]]s, and so on.\n\nA single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they would have to vote against their own party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive power. However, this is contradicted by the \"kingmaker\" factor mentioned above.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Electoral alliance]]\n* [[Electoral fusion]]\n* [[Hung parliament]]\n* [[List of democracy and election-related topics]]\n* [[List of countries with coalition governments]]\n* [[Majority government]]\n* [[Minority government]]\n* [[Plurality voting system]]\n* [[Political coalition]]\n* [[Political organisation]]\n* [[:Category:Political party alliances]]\n* [[Popular front]]\n* [[Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)|Unholy alliance]]\n* [[United front]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Coalition Spectrum navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coalition Government}}\n[[Category:Coalition governments]]\n\n[[cs:Koalice#Vl\u00e1dn\u00ed koalice]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Form of government}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2010}}\n{{politics}}\nA '''coalition government''' is a form of government in which political parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that \"coalition\". The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the [[election]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis (for example, during wartime or economic crisis) to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] or [[collective identity]], it can also play a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed all-party coalitions ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.\n\n==Practice==\n{{original research section|date=June 2009}}\nWhen a general election does not produce a clear majority for a single party, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a group of parties that command a majority in parliament tend to be more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of no confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{see also|List of countries with coalition governments}}\nCountries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kosovo]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Switzerland]] has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the \"[[Magic Formula]]\". Between 2010 and 2015, the [[United Kingdom]] also operated a formal coalition between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties, but this was unusual: the UK usually has a single-party majority government.\n\n===Coalitions composed of few parties===\n{{party politics}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n\n{{see also|National Government (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom coalition government (disambiguation)}}\nIn the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], coalition governments (sometimes known as \"national governments\") usually have only been formed at times of national crisis. The most prominent was the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both [[world war]]s. Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function: for instance the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] formed [[Lib-Lab pact|a pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] from March 1977 until July 1978, after a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labour's majority of three seats which had been gained at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]]. However, in the run-up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Labour opposition leader [[Tony Blair]] was in talks with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Paddy Ashdown]] about forming a coalition government if Labour failed to win a majority at the election; but there proved to be no need for a coalition as Labour won the election by a [[landslide victory|landslide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work:Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> The [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] (Britain's first for [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], led by [[David Cameron]], which had won the largest number of seats, formed a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to gain a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/05/lib-dems-government-deal|title=Tories and Lib Dems enter full coalition government|magazine=The New Statesman}}</ref> It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition,<ref>Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, [[David Cameron]] on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill (1949) ''Their Finest Hour''.</ref>\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have entered into a coalition twice in the [[Scottish Parliament]], as well as twice in the [[Welsh Assembly]].\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] together with their partners the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CDU/CSU), or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example, [[Helmut Kohl]]'s CDU governed for years in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s SPD was in power with the [[German Green Party|Greens]]; and from 2009 [[Angela Merkel]], CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.\n\n\"Grand coalitions\" of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare, as large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early [[2005 German federal election|elections]], the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellery]] while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts. Parties frequently make statements ahead of elections which coalitions they categorically reject, similar to election promises or shadow cabinets in other countries.\n\nIn Germany, coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties (CDU and CSU, two allies which always form a single [[caucus]], are in this regard considered a single party). However, in the 2010s coalitions on the state level increasingly included three different parties, often [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Greens and one of the major parties or \"red red green\" coalitions of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Linkspartei]] and Greens. By 2016, the Greens have joined governments on the state level in eleven coalitions in seven various constellations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://eu.boell.org/sites/default/files/greens_in_government.pdf|title=German Greens in Coalition Governments. A Political Analysis.|last=Jungjohann|first=Arne|publisher=Heinrich-B\u00f6ll-Stiftung European Union and Green European Foundation|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=19}}</ref>\n\n===Examples of coalitions===\n\n====Armenia====\n[[Armenia]] became an independent state in 1991, following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since then, many political parties were formed in it, who mainly work with each other to form coalition governments. Currently the country is governed by the [[My Step Alliance]] coalition after successfully gaining a majority in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] following the [[2018 Armenian parliamentary election]].\n\n====Australia====\nIn federal [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]], the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]], [[National Party of Australia|National]], [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] and [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] parties are united in a coalition, known simply as [[Coalition (Australia)|the Coalition]]. The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a [[two-party system|two-party]] house, with the Coalition and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] being the major parties. This coalition is also found in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] the Liberal and National parties compete separately, while in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] the two parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party, in 1978, and the Liberal National Party, in 2008, respectively.\n\nThe other federal coalition has been:\n*[[United Australia Party|United Australia]]\u2013[[National Country Party|Country]]\u2013Independents coalition in [[1940 Australian federal election|1940]]\n*In [[Tasmanian Government|Tasmania]]:\n**Liberal\u2013Greens coalition in [[1996 Tasmanian state election|1996]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions formed in [[1989 Tasmanian state election|1989]] and [[2010 Tasmanian state election|2010]].\n*In the [[ACT Government|Australian Capital Territory]]:\n**Liberal\u2013[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] coalition in [[1998 Australian Capital Territory general election|1998]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions in [[2001 Australian Capital Territory general election|2001]] and [[2008 Australian Capital Territory general election|2008]].\n\n====Belgium====\nIn [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], where there are separate [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking and [[French language|French]]-speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are common.\n\n====Canada====\nIn [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], the [[Great Coalition]] was formed in 1864 by the [[Clear Grits]], [[Parti bleu]], and [[Liberal-Conservative Party]]. During the [[First World War]], Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/precedents-from-around-the-world-1.876563|title=Coalition Government: Precedents from around the world|publisher=CBC News|date=2010-05-13|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[1919 Ontario general election|1919 Ontario election]], the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] and the [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour Party]], together with three independent MLAs, formed a coalition that governed [[Ontario]] until 1923.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], the governing Liberals formed a coalition with the opposition Conservatives in order to prevent the surging, left-wing [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] from taking power in the [[1941 British Columbia general election]]. Liberal premier [[Duff Pattullo]] refused to form a coalition with the third-place Conservatives, so his party removed him. The Liberal\u2013Conservative coalition introduced a winner-take-all preferential voting system (the \"[[Alternative Vote]]\") in the hopes that their supporters would rank the other party as their second preference; however, this strategy did not take CCF second preferences into account. In the [[1952 British Columbia general election]], to the surprise of many, the right-wing populist [[BC Social Credit Party]] won a minority. They were able to win a majority in the subsequent election as Liberal and Conservative supporters shifted their anti-CCF vote to Social Credit.\n\nManitoba has had more formal coalition governments than any other province. Following gains by the United Farmer's/Progressive movement elsewhere in the country, the [[United Farmers of Manitoba]] unexpectedly won the 1921 election. Like their counterparts in Ontario, they had not expected to win and did not have a leader. They asked [[John Bracken]], a professor in animal husbandry, to become leader and premier. Bracken changed the party's name to the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]]. During the Great Depression, Bracken survived at a time when other premiers were being defeated by forming a coalition government with the Manitoba Liberals (eventually, the two parties would merge into the [[Manitoba Liberal Party#Liberal-Progressive Party: Merger with the Progressives|Liberal-Progressive Party of Manitoba]], and decades later, the party would change its name to the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]]). In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government with almost every party in the Manitoba Legislature (the Conservatives, CCF, and Social Credit; however, the CCF broke with the coalition after a few years over policy differences). The only party not included was the small, communist [[Labor-Progressive Party]], which had a handful of seats.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, NDP premier [[Roy Romanow]] formed a formal coalition with the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party|Saskatchewan Liberals]] in 1999 after being reduced to a minority. After two years, the newly elected Liberal leader David Karwacki  ordered the coalition be disbanded, the Liberal caucus disagreed with him and left the Liberals to run as New Democrats in the upcoming election. The [[Saskatchewan NDP]] was re-elected with a majority under its new leader [[Lorne Calvert]], while the Saskatchewan Liberals lost their remaining seats and have not been competitive in the province since.\n\nAccording to historian [[Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)|Christopher Moore]], coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. Such a manner of leadership election had never been tried in any parliamentary system before. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely.<ref name=Moore-1>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Christopher|year=2011|title=Come together|journal=[[Canada's History]]|issue=June\u2013July 2011|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008\u201309 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], two of Canada's opposition parties signed an agreement to form what would become the country's second coalition government since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] if the minority Conservative government was defeated on a vote of non-confidence,<ref>{{cite news|title=Coalition Set To Topple Canada PM|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122818032317670973?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-02|author=Menon, Nirmala}}</ref> unseating [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. The [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and the coalition dispersed before parliament was reconvened.\n\n====Denmark====\nFrom the creation of the [[Folketing]] in 1849 through the introduction of [[proportional representation]] in 1918, there were only single-party governments in Denmark. [[Thorvald Stauning]] formed his [[Stauning II Cabinet|second government]] and Denmark's first coalition government in 1929. With the exception of a string of one-party governments during the 1970s, the norm since 1929 has been coalition governments. Every government from 1982 until the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 elections]] were coalitions. The most recent coalition was [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen III Cabinet|L\u00f8kke's third government]], which was replaced by the one-party [[Frederiksen Cabinet|Frederiksen government]] in 2019.\n\nWhen the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] under Stauning won 46% of the votes in the [[1935 Danish Folketing election|1935 election]], this was the closest any party has gotten to winning an outright majority in parliament. One party has thus never held a majority alone, and even one-party governments since 1918 have needed the [[Confidence and supply|support]] of at least one other party to govern. For example, the current government consists only of the Social Democrats, but also relies on the support of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], and the [[Red\u2013Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red\u2013Green Alliance]].\n\n====Finland====\nIn [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government ([[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|Lipponen I]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second cabinet|II]]) since [[Finland's declaration of independence|independence]] with a five-party governing coalition, a so-called \"rainbow government\". The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record and were unusual in the respect that both the centre-left (SDP) and radical left-wing (Left Alliance) parties sat in the government with the major centre-right party (National Coalition). The [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|Katainen cabinet]] was also a rainbow coalition of a total of five parties.\n\n====India====\nSince India's Independence on 15 August 1947, [[Indian National Congress]], the major political party instrumental in [[Indian independence movement]], ruled the nation. The first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], second PM [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and the third PM [[Indira Gandhi]], all were from the Congress party. However, [[Raj Narain]], who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of [[Rae Bareilly]] in 1971, lodged a case, alleging electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security. The [[1977 Indian general election|next election's result]] was that [[Politics of India|India]]'s first-ever coalition government was formed at the national level under the Prime Ministership of [[Morarji Desai]], which was also the first non-Congress national government, which existed from 24 March 1977 to 15 July 1979, headed by the [[Janata Party]],<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite news|title=OBITUARY: Morarji Desai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-morarji-desai-1615165.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|author=Kuldip Singh|date=1995-04-11|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> an amalgam of political parties opposed to Emergency imposed between 1975 and 1977. As the popularity of Janata Party dwindled, Morarji Desai had to resign and [[Charan Singh]], a rival of Desai became the fifth PM. However, due to lack of support, this coalition government did not complete its five-year term.\n\nCongress returned to the power in 1980 under Indira Gandhi, and later under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as the 6th PM. However, the next [[1989 Indian general election|general election of 1989]] once again brought a coalition government under [[National Front (India)|National Front]], which lasted until 1991, with two Prime Ministers, the second one being supported by Congress. The 1991 election resulted in a Congress led stable [[minority government]] for five years. The next 11th [[Lok Sabha|parliament]] produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998. The first successful coalition government in India which completed the whole 5-year term was the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] as PM from 1999 to 2004. Then another coalition, Congress led [[United Progressive Alliance]], consisting of 13 separate parties ruled India for two terms from 2004 to 2014 with [[Manmohan Singh]] as PM. However, in the [[2014 Indian general election|16th general election]] in May 2014, BJP secured majority on its own (first party to do so since 1984 election) and National Democratic Alliance came into power, with [[Narendra Modi]] as Prime Minister. In 2019, Narendra Modi got re-elected as Prime Minister for the second time as National Democratic Alliance again secured majority in the [[2019 Indian general election|17th general election]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nAs a result of the [[Fall of Suharto|toppling of Suharto]], political freedom is significantly increased. Compared to only three parties allowed to exist in the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, a total of 48 political parties participated in the [[1999 Indonesian legislative election|1999 election]], a total of 24 parties in the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|2004 election]], 38 parties in the [[2009 Indonesian legislative election|2009 election]], and 15 parties in the [[2014 Indonesian legislative election|2014 election]]. There are no majority winner of those elections and coalition governments are inevitable. The current government is a coalition of seven parties led by the [[Indonesian Democratic Party \u2013 Struggle|PDIP]] and [[Party of the Functional Groups|Golkar]].\n\n====Ireland====\nIn [[Republic of Ireland]], coalition governments are quite common; not since 1977 has a single party been able to form a majority government. Coalitions are the typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of a minority Fine Gael government, supported by a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement with Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nIreland's first coalition government was formed in [[1948 Irish general election|1948]]. Ireland has had consecutive coalition governments since the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 general election]], excluding two brief Fianna F\u00e1il minority administrations in 1994 and 2011 that followed the withdrawal of their coalition partners from government. Before 1989, Fianna F\u00e1il had opposed participation in coalition governments, preferring single-party minority government instead.\n\nIrish coalition governments have traditionally been based on one of two large blocs in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]: either Fianna F\u00e1il in coalition with smaller parties or independents, or Fine Gael and the Labour Party in coalition, sometimes with smaller parties. The only exception to these traditional alliances was the [[23rd Government of Ireland]], comprising Fianna F\u00e1il and the Labour Party, which ruled between 1993 and 1994. The [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il]], though a traditional Fine Gael\u2013Labour coalition, resembles a [[grand coalition]], due to the collapse of the Fianna F\u00e1il to third place among parties in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n====Israel====\nA similar situation exists in [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], which typically has at least 10 parties holding representation in the [[Knesset]]. The only faction to ever gain the majority of Knesset seats was [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], an alliance of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and [[Mapam]] that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968 to 1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing [[Likud]] in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties. [[Ariel Sharon]]'s formation of the centrist [[Kadima]] party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.\n\nIsrael also formed a [[national unity government]] from [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984\u20131988]]. The premiership and foreign ministry portfolio were held by the head of each party for two years, and they switched roles in 1986.\n\n====Japan====\nPost-World War II [[Politics of Japan|Japan]] has historically been dominated by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], but there was a brief coalition government formed after the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 election]] following LDP's first loss of its overall [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] majority since 1955, winning only 223 out of 511 seats. The LDP government was replaced by an eight-party coalition government, which consisted of all of the previous opposition parties excluding the [[Japanese Communist Party]], who together controlled 243 seats. Every Japanese government since then has been a coalition government in one way or another.\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{Main|Electoral system of New Zealand#MMP in New Zealand}}\n[[MMP representation|MMP]] was introduced in [[New Zealand]] in [[1996 New Zealand general election|the 1996 election]]. \nIn order to get into power, parties need to get a total of 50% of the 121 seats in parliament \u2013 61. Since no parties have ever gotten a full majority, they must form coalitions with other parties. For example, during the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] got 46 seats and [[New Zealand First]] got nine. The two formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Coalition Government]] with [[confidence and supply]] from the [[Green Party (New Zealand)|Green Party]] which got eight seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/full-video-nz-first-leader-winston-peters-announces-next-government.html |title=Full video: NZ First leader Winston Peters announces next Government |author=Chapman, Grant |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/an-historic-moment-for-the-green-party-james-shaw.html |title=An 'historic moment' for the Green Party \u2013 James Shaw |author=Hurley, Emma |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Spain ====\nSince 2015, there are coalition governments in municipalities, autonomous regions and, since 2020 (coming from the [[November 2019 Spanish general election]]), in the Spanish Government. There are two ways of conforming them: all of them based on a program and its institutional architecture, one consists on distributing the different areas of government between the parties conforming the coalition and the other one is, like in the Valencian Community<ref>{{cite web |title=Generalitat Valenciana's political structure |website=http://www.gvaoberta.gva.es/es/estructura-organica |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>, where the ministries are structured with members of all the political parties being represented, so that conflicts that may occur are regarding competences and not fights between parties.\n\n==== Uruguay ====\n\nSince the [[1989 Uruguayan general election|1989 election]], there have been 4 coalition governments, all including at least both the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] and the liberal [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]]. The first one was after the election of the blanco [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] and lasted until 1992 due to policy disagreements, the longest lasting coalition was the Colorado-led coalition under the second government of [[Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti]], in which the national leader [[Alberto Volont\u00e9]] was frequently described as a \"Prime Minister\", the next coalition (under president [[Jorge Batlle]]) was also Colorado-led, but it lasted only until after the [[2002 Uruguay banking crisis]], when the blancos abandoned the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/lacalle-herrera-batlle-gobernar-coalicion.html|title=De Lacalle Herrera a Batlle: c\u00f3mo gobernar en coalici\u00f3n|last=ElPais|website=Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|language=spanish|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> After the [[2019 Uruguayan general election]], the blanco [[Luis Lacalle Pou]] formed the [[Coalici\u00f3n Multicolor|coalici\u00f3n multicolor]], composed of his own National Party, the liberal Colorado Party, the right wing populist [[Open Cabildo (Uruguay)|Open Cabildo]] and the center left [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/es/los-desaf%C3%ADos-de-lacalle-el-nuevo-presidente-del-pa%C3%ADs-m%C3%A1s-estable-de-latinoam%C3%A9rica/a-51477669|title=Los desaf\u00edos de Lacalle, el nuevo presidente del pa\u00eds m\u00e1s estable de Latinoam\u00e9rica {{!}} DW {{!}} 29.11.2019|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nAdvocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising differing parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the [[Constituency|electorate]] within a country.<ref name=\"Moore-1\"/>\n\nThose who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moury |first1=Catherine |last2=Timmermans |first2=Arco |title=Inter-party conflict management in coalition governments: Analyzing the role of coalition agreements in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands |journal=Politics and Governance |date=25 July 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013131 |doi=10.17645/pag.v1i2.94 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/94 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in [[Flanders]] or [[Northern Ireland]]. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play \"[[kingmaker]]\" and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.\n\nCoalition governments have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2014}} for sustaining a [[consensus]] on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals \u2014 even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.\n\nPowerful parties can also act in an [[Oligocracy|oligocratic]] way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to [[two-party system]]s, which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory [[nomination rules]] regulations and [[plurality voting system]]s, and so on.\n\nA single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they would have to vote against their own party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive power. However, this is contradicted by the \"kingmaker\" factor mentioned above.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Electoral alliance]]\n* [[Electoral fusion]]\n* [[Hung parliament]]\n* [[List of democracy and election-related topics]]\n* [[List of countries with coalition governments]]\n* [[Majority government]]\n* [[Minority government]]\n* [[Plurality voting system]]\n* [[Political coalition]]\n* [[Political organisation]]\n* [[:Category:Political party alliances]]\n* [[Popular front]]\n* [[Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)|Unholy alliance]]\n* [[United front]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Coalition Spectrum navbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coalition Government}}\n[[Category:Coalition governments]]\n[[cs:Koalice#Vl\u00e1dn\u00ed koalice]]\n", "name_user": "Kahtar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Repair CS1 error(s), replaced: website=http://www. \u2192 website=", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government"}

It remains an enduring symbol of France which appears on French postage stamps, although it has never been adopted officially by any of the [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French republics]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->.

It is widely used in French city emblems as in the coat of arms of the city of Lille, Saint-Denis, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Boulogne-Billancourt, and Calais. Some cities that had been particularly faithful to the French Crown were awarded{{by whom|date=March 2018}} a heraldic augmentation of two or three fleurs-de-lis on the chief of their coat of arms; such cities include Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Reims, Le Havre, Angers, Le Mans, Aix-en-Provence, Tours, Limoges, Amiens, Orl\u00e9ans, Rouen, Argenteuil, Poitiers, Chartres, and Laon, among others. The fleur-de-lis was the symbol of [[\u00cele-de-France]], the core of the French kingdom. It has appeared on the coat-of-arms of other historical provinces of France including Burgundy, Anjou, Picardy, Berry, Orl\u00e9anais, Bourbonnais, Maine, Touraine, Artois, Dauphin\u00e9, Saintonge, and the County of La Marche. Many of the current French ''[[Departments of France |departments]]'' use the symbol on their coats-of-arms to express this heritage.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{anchor|Florentine lily|Florentine fleurs-de-lis}}\nIn [[Italy]], the fleur de lis, called ''giglio bottonato'' ([[:it:Giglio bottonato|it]]), is mainly known from the crest of the city of [[Florence]]. In the Florentine fleurs-de-lis,{{Ref label|f|f|f}} the [[stamen]]s are always posed between the [[petal]]s. Originally ''[[argent]]'' (silver or white) on ''[[gules]]'' (red) background, the emblem became the standard of the imperial party in Florence (''parte [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|ghibellina]]''), causing the town government, which maintained a staunch ''[[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]]'' stance, being strongly opposed to the imperial pretensions on city states, to reverse the color pattern to the final ''gules'' lily on ''argent'' background.<ref>Luciano Artusi, Firenze araldica, pp. 280, Polistampa, Firenze, 2006, {{ISBN|88-596-0149-5}}</ref> This heraldic charge is often known as the '''Florentine lily''' to distinguish it from the conventional (stamen-not-shown) design. As an emblem of the city, it is therefore found in icons of [[Zenobius of Florence|Zenobius]], its first bishop,<ref>Hall, James (1974). ''Dictionary of Subjects & Symbols in Art''. Harper & Row. {{ISBN|0-06-433316-7}}. p.124.</ref> and associated with Florence's patron Saint [[John the Baptist]] in the Florentine [[Florin (Italian coin)|fiorino]]. Several towns subjugated by Florence or founded within the territory of the Florentine Republic adopted a variation of the Florentine lily in their crests, often without the stamens.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe heraldic fleur-de-lis is still widespread: among the numerous cities which use it as a symbol are some whose names echo the word 'lily', for example, [[Liljendal]], Finland, and [[Lelystad]], Netherlands. This is called [[canting arms]] in heraldic terminology. Other European examples of municipal coats-of-arms bearing the fleur-de-lis include [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] in England, [[Morc\u00edn]] in Spain, [[Wiesbaden]] in Germany, [[Skierniewice]] in Poland and [[Jurbarkas]] in Lithuania.

What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named [[Lys river|Leie]] in the [[Flanders]]. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises \u2014as many plants grow for centuries in the same places\u2014: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of ''lis''. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.</blockquote>\n[[File:Fleur.iris.2.png|thumb| ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' compared with fleur-de-lis [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] in French ''<ref name= \"architecture_dictionnaire_flore\">{{cite web|url= http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_raisonn%C3%A9_de_l%E2%80%99architecture_fran%C3%A7aise_du_XIe_au_XVIe_si%C3%A8cle_-_Tome_5,_Flore |title=Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle \u2013 Tome 5, Flore \u2013 Wikisource |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nThe heraldist Fran\u00e7ois Velde is known to have expressed the same opinion:<ref name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Velde\">{{cite web\n | last = Velde\n | first = Fran\u00e7ois\n | title = The Fleur-de-lis\n | date =  | url = http://www.heraldica.org/topics/fdl.htm\n | accessdate = 2013-09-13}}</ref>\n \n<blockquote>\"However, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called 'fleur-de-lis'. This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag.

The historian [[Michel Pastoureau]] says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the [[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]'s \"lily among thorns\" (''lilium inter spinas''), understood as a reference to Mary. Other [[Religious text|scripture]] and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the fleur-de-lis represented the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].<ref name=\"heraldica1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/fdl.htm |title=The Fleur-de-Lys |publisher=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Post|first=W.

Johns, ''Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power in the Twelfth-Century Anglo-Norman Realm'' (Manchester 2003) p130</ref> Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]], starting with [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church's [[Virgin of Paris]] statue (with lily), and in the centre of the [[stained glass]] rose window (with fleur-de-lis sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be \"simple [[wiktionary:fleuron|fleurons]], sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis\".<ref name=\"Michel Pastoureau p.100\"/> As attributes of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of [[Sandro Botticelli]] and [[Filippo Lippi]]. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his ''Madonna in the Forest''.\n\nThe three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary. The tradition says that without Mary you can not understand the Trinity since it was she who bore the Son.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0766140091&id |title=Church Symbolism \u2013 F.

Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one Divine Substance ([[Godhead in Christianity|godhood]]) of the three Persons, which binds Them together.\n\n\"Flower of light\" symbolism has sometimes been understood from the archaic variant ''fleur-de-luce'' (see Latin ''lux, luc-'' = \"light\"), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] suggests this arose from the spelling, not from the [[etymology]].<ref>A \"fanciful derivation\", ''Oxford English Dictionary '' (1989)</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Fence, Buckingham Palace London April 2006 077.jpg|thumb|Fleurs-de-lis on railings at [[Buckingham Palace]]]]\nIn building and architecture, the fleur-de-lis is often placed on top of iron fence posts, as a pointed defence against intruders. It may ornament any tip, point or post with a decorative flourish, for instance, on [[finial]]s, the arms of a cross, or the point of a [[gable]]. The fleur-de-lis can be incorporated in friezes or cornices, although the distinctions between fleur-de-lis, fleuron, and other stylized flowers are not always clear,<ref name=\"architecture_dictionnaire_flore\" /><ref>[[s:fr:Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle \u2013 Tome 5, Flore|Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle \u2013 Tome 5, Flore]]</ref> or can be used as a motif in an all-over tiled pattern, perhaps on a floor.\nIt may appear in a building for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower on his coat of arms. Elsewhere the effect seems purely visual, like the [[crenellation]]s on the 14th-century Muslim [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan]].\nIt can also be seen on the doors of the 16th-century Hindu [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]].\n\n==Modern usage==\nSome modern usage of the fleur-de-lis reflects \"the continuing presence of heraldry in everyday life\", often intentionally, but also when users are not aware that they are \"prolonging the life of centuries-old insignia and emblems\".<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Heraldry: its origins and meaning'' p.93-94</ref>\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H12824.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier of the [[Manchester Regiment]] with their fleur-de-lis badge on his helmet, in 1941.]]\n\n===Military===\nFleurs-de-lis are featured on military badges.

What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named [[Lys river|Leie]] in the [[Flanders]]. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises \u2014as many plants grow for centuries in the same places\u2014: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of ''lis''. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.</blockquote>\n[[File:Fleur.iris.2.png|thumb| ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' compared with fleur-de-lis [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] in French ''<ref name= \"architecture_dictionnaire_flore\">{{cite web|url= http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_raisonn%C3%A9_de_l%E2%80%99architecture_fran%C3%A7aise_du_XIe_au_XVIe_si%C3%A8cle_-_Tome_5,_Flore |title=Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle \u2013 Tome 5, Flore \u2013 Wikisource |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nThe heraldist Fran\u00e7ois Velde is known to have expressed the same opinion:<ref name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Velde\">{{cite web\n | last = Velde\n | first = Fran\u00e7ois\n | title = The Fleur-de-lis\n | date =  | url = http://www.heraldica.org/topics/fdl.htm\n | accessdate = 2013-09-13}}</ref>\n \n<blockquote>\"However, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called 'fleur-de-lis'. This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag.

The historian [[Michel Pastoureau]] says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the [[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]]'s \"lily among thorns\" (''lilium inter spinas''), understood as a reference to Mary. Other [[Religious text|scripture]] and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the fleur-de-lis represented the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].<ref name=\"heraldica1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/fdl.htm |title=The Fleur-de-Lys |publisher=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Post|first=W.

Johns, ''Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power in the Twelfth-Century Anglo-Norman Realm'' (Manchester 2003) p130</ref> Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]], starting with [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church's [[Virgin of Paris]] statue (with lily), and in the centre of the [[stained glass]] rose window (with fleur-de-lis sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be \"simple [[wiktionary:fleuron|fleurons]], sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis\".<ref name=\"Michel Pastoureau p.100\"/> As attributes of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of [[Sandro Botticelli]] and [[Filippo Lippi]]. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his ''Madonna in the Forest''.\n\nThe three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary.

But, because the Chevrolet name is French, the manufacturer has used the fleur-de-lis emblems on their cars, most notably the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]], but also as a small detail in the badges and emblems on the front of a variety of full-size Chevys from the 1950s, and 1960s.  The fleur-de-lis has also been featured more prominently in the emblems of the [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice sedan]].\n\nA fleur-de-lis also appears in some of the logos of local [[Louisiana]] media, such as [[WGNO-TV]] and [[WVUE-TV]], the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-affiliated television stations in New Orleans respectively.\n\nThe fleur-de-lis is one of the objects to drop during the [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations in New Orleans, which was broadcast for the first time during ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve|Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve '17 with Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\nNew Orleans sludge metal band [[Crowbar (American band)|Crowbar]] use it as a logo.

John Yossarian'''  is a [[fictional character]], the [[protagonist]] of [[Joseph Heller]]'s satirical novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' and its sequel ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]''. In ''Catch-22'', Yossarian is a 28-year-old [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|captain]] in the 256th Squadron of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] where he serves as a [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] stationed on the small island of [[Pianosa]] off the [[Italy|Italian]] mainland during [[World War II]]. Yossarian's exploits have previously been thought to be based on the experiences of the author. Heller was also a [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]] in the Army Air Corps, stationed on an island off the coast of [[Italy]] during the war. Heller later documented in his autobiography \"Now & Then\" the elements of Yossarian which came from his experiences (specifically the episodes where Yossarian attends to Snowden during the Avignon mission).  Heller noted that he derived the name Yossarian from a wartime friend and fellow bombardier, Francis Yohannan. Yohannan made the military his career, continuing to serve through the Vietnam War, placing him at odds with Yossarian's feelings towards the military and as noted in his obituary \"(Yohannan) turned aside calls from reporters who asked if he was the real-life Yossarian.\"  A possible source for Yossarian's narrative adventure and efforts to be relieved of his combat duties is Lt. Julius Fish, another bombardier and wartime friend to both Francis Yohannan and Joseph Heller.\n\n== Name ==\nYossarian's first name appears to be \"John,\" since late in ''Catch-22'' Colonel Korn says to him \"Call me Blackie, John. We're pals now.\"\n''Catch-22'' introduces Yossarian as an American soldier in World War II with [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] heritage, although ''Closing Time'' clarifies this to be a joke and that his heritage and surname are in fact [[Armenian people|Armenian]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Heller|authorlink=Joseph Heller|title=[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York City|ISBN=9780743586528|pages=11\u20132, 236}}</ref>\n\nThe exotic name \"Yossarian\" was chosen by Heller to emphasize his protagonist's detachment from mainstream military culture. Yossarian's name is described as \"an odious, alien, distasteful name, that just did not inspire confidence.\" It was \"...not at all like such clean, crisp, honest, American names as Cathcart, Peckem and Dreedle.\" As to the origins of the name, \"Heller admitted in later years that the name 'Yossarian' was derived from the name of one of his Air Force buddies, Francis Yohannan \u2013 an Assyrian \u2013 but that the character of Yossarian himself was 'the incarnation of a wish' (''[[Now and Then (Joseph Heller book)|Now and Then]]'' 175-6).<ref name=Scoggins>Scoggins, Michael C.: \"Joseph Heller\u2019s Combat Experiences in Catch-22\"; ''War, Literature and the Arts'', vol. 15; pg. 223.

I enjoyed it?'|last=|first=|date=|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Character sketch ==\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThroughout the novel, Yossarian's main concern is the idea that people are trying to kill him, either directly (by attacking his plane) or indirectly (by forcing him to fly missions) and he goes to great lengths to stay alive.\n\n=== Goals ===\nYossarian's motivation is to \"live forever or die in the attempt.\" To survive the war, Yossarian employs a number of strategems\n* Postponing dangerous missions by any means possible (e.g. poisoning the squadron and moving the bomb line during the \"Great Big Siege of [[Bologna]]\").\n* Constantly checking into the hospital with contrived liver complaints (\"a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice\"), including the fictitious \"Garnett-Fleischaker syndrome\" and by exploiting the fact he always runs a temperature of 101 degrees [[fahrenheit]] (38 degrees [[celsius]]).\n* Ordering his pilot to perform harsh evasive action in the face of flak, something he will not trust anyone else to do.\n* \"Plotting an emergency heading into [[Switzerland]]\" so he can be interned for the duration of the war \"under conditions of utmost ease and luxury.\"\n\nYossarian, like many of the other soldiers, tries to escape the realities of war by getting drunk, gorging himself in the mess hall and having sex, although events in the novel make it easy to believe he would do these things anyway.\n\n=== Relationships and conflicts ===\nYossarian is in continual conflict with the military policy \"Catch-22,\" a circularly-reasoned bureaucratic trap which his superiors use to justify many of their illogical demands.\n\nThe bulk of ''Catch-22'' concerns Yossarian's relationships with the other officers in his squadron, such as the neurotic [[List of Catch-22 characters|Hungry Joe]], the [[war profiteering|war profiteer]] [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo]], the idealistic [[Nately]] and selfish [[Doc Daneeka]]. There are many characters Yossarian hates and likes. His best friends are [[Dunbar (Catch-22)|Dunbar]], [[Chaplain Tappman]], Nately, Hungry Joe, [[List of Catch-22 characters|McWatt]] and [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]]. Yossarian is greatly saddened when [[List of Catch-22 characters|Clevinger]] and Orr disappear, despite frequently arguing with these characters. He hates the majority of his superiors for putting him in harm's way, especially the sadistic [[Joseph McCarthy|Joe McCarthy]]-like careerist [[Captain Black (Catch-22)|Captain Black]] and the egomaniacal [[Colonel Cathcart]], who continually raises the number of missions required before the aircrews can rotate back home as well as volunteering his aircrews for the most dangerous missions, to make himself look good to his superiors.\n\nYossarian shows particular grief for the men that die during the novel, particularly Snowden, McWatt, Nately, [[Dobbs (Catch-22)|Dobbs]] and Hungry Joe or those who disappear: Orr, Clevinger and Dunbar. While the book tells us nothing of Yossarian's relationship with [[List of Catch-22 characters|Snowden]], it is Yossarian's doomed attempt to save Snowden and his witnessing the latter's gruesome death that forms the emotional centre of the book.\n\n=== Epiphany ===\nAt the end of the novel, Yossarian accepts a deal with [[Colonel Cathcart]] and [[Colonel Korn]] rather than face a court-martial for going [[AWOL]] in [[Rome]]. The deal allows Yossarian to go home but only if he pretends to be \"pals\" to [[Colonel Cathcart]] and [[Colonel Korn]]; to \"become one of the boys.\" Korn explains this means the Army is \"going to glorify you and send you home a hero, recalled by the Pentagon for morale and public-relations purposes.\" It allows Yossarian to get out of the war, without any more contribution to the low morale which has been spreading through the Group because of him and to make the colonels look good to their superiors. Yossarian finds this deal \"odious\" as it lets down all the others in the squadron who were relying on his dissent to force their commanders to treat them better and admits he did it \"in a moment of weakness.\" When he learns the \"official report\" had twisted the event of [[Nately's Whore|Nately's whore]] stabbing him into Yossarian taking a knife wound from a [[Nazi]] assassin to protect the colonels, Yossarian resents being manipulated as \"part of the deal.\"\n\nYossarian's epiphany comes when he hears of [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]]\u2019s escape to [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]], the culmination of Orr's many attempts to escape combat duty (constantly crashing his plane, the prostitute hitting him over the head, etc.) which Yossarian had interpreted as incompetence; Orr had offered hints of this intention in exchanges between the two. Yossarian realizes it is possible to defeat (or at least escape) the military and the Catch-22 that supports it. Yossarian justifies his desertion by stating \"I\u2019m not running away from my responsibilities. I\u2019m running to them. There\u2019s nothing negative about running away to save my life.\"\n\n==In ''Catch-22''==\n{{main|Catch-22}}\nThroughout the book, Yossarian's main concern is the idea that people are trying to kill him, either directly (by attacking his plane) or indirectly (by forcing him to fly missions). His suspicion develops into [[paranoia]] after his attempts to find answers by using logic and reason are thwarted by a combination of vague bureaucracy, transparent yet contradicting [[US Army|Army]] regulations and personality conflicts. He is unable to fly the required number of missions to be discharged from duty, because his superiors keep increasing the number of missions. He cannot obtain a [[section 8 (military)|Section 8]] by pretending to be [[insane]] because his superiors see his desire to get out of flying as a sign of perfect [[sanity]] (hence [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]). Yossarian [[boycott]]s flying missions as much as possible, either through [[Malingering|feigning illness]] or inventing an excuse to return to base (like a busted intercom.) The novel begins with Yossarian staying in the hospital due to an invented [[liver]] condition. He busies himself by arbitrarily censoring letters and signing them [[Washington Irving]], Irving Washington, or (as gets the Chaplain into trouble with authorities) A. T. Tappman, the Chaplain's name (R. O. Shipman in the original version of the book and in British Editions).\n\nWhenever on leave, Yossarian and his friends carouse, drink, and sleep around as much as they can, knowing and fearing they could be killed on the next mission. One of the [[prostitute]]s they employ becomes Nately's unofficial girlfriend (she is referred to only as \"[[Nately's Whore]]\" and \"Nately's Girl\"). Despite Nately's repeated advances, she spurns him cruelly until he, instead of sleeping with her, lets her get a good night's sleep. By the next morning she has fallen deeply in love with him. When Nately is killed, she blames Yossarian for his death; she manifests a towering rage and tries to kill Yossarian several times during the remainder of the narrative in an impossible manner (constantly tracking Yossarian down, even after he dumped her hundreds of miles behind enemy territory.)\n\n===Yossarian's tentmates===\nThe squadron houses its soldiers in large tents. At the start of the novel Yossarian is assigned to a tent with [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] and a third officer referred to as \"The Dead Man in Yossarian's Tent\"{{spnd}}Lt. Mudd{{spnd}}who was sent on a mission immediately upon his arrival and died in combat before he ever even got the official chance to check in. His belongings remain on the bed where he threw them; due to the illogical bureaucratic procedures the armed forces are shown to follow, the belongings cannot be officially removed since Mudd had never officially arrived.\n\nYossarian and Orr get along well and Orr customizes the tent making it much more comfortable. After Orr is declared [[Missing in action|M.I.A.]] and presumed dead, four new officers are assigned to the tent but Yossarian cannot tolerate them. [[Sergeant Towser]] offers Yossarian the option of being assigned to the same tent as [[Nately]] but he refuses to leave.\n\nThe new tentmates call Yossarian \"Yo-Yo\" and are afraid of him and go out of their way to help him, always offering him the warmest expressions of goodwill and generally behaving with intolerable conviviality. They are rambunctious because of their young age and lack of military experience. They tend to like those whom Yossarian hates and fears and do not mind the increasing number of missions. They do what Yossarian and the Air Force were unable to do{{spnd}}get rid of The Dead Man in Yossarian's Tent{{spnd}}by throwing his belongings into the woods.\n\n=== Snowden ===\n{{redirect|Snowden (character)|the snowman|Snowden on Ice}}\nSnowden is a member of Yossarian's flight during a mission and acts as catalyst for the fundamental change in Yossarian's mentality and outlook. After their aircraft is hit by anti-aircraft fire, Snowden is mortally wounded and Yossarian attempts to help by treating a serious leg wound with white bandages and [[sulfanilamide]] powder.\n\nEventually Yossarian notices bleeding from Snowden's armpit and realises he has another wound under his flak suit. As Yossarian rips open the flak suit, a fatal wound beneath exposes Snowden's internal organs which fall out onto the floor. A huge chunk of flak had ripped straight through his ribs from behind. Yossarian is horrified at the sight. Snowden is about to die but is able to tell Yossarian he is cold. Yossarian covers Snowden in a [[parachute]] and comforts him by saying \"there, there.\"\n\nSnowden's death embodies Yossarian's desire to evade death; by seeing Snowden's entrails spilling over the plane, he feels that \"Man was matter, that was Snowden\u2019s secret. Drop him out a window and he\u2019ll fall. Set fire to him and he\u2019ll burn. Bury him and he\u2019ll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden\u2019s secret. Ripeness was all.\"\n\nThe experience on the plane dramatically changes Yossarian's attitude towards life. He looks only to protect his life and to an extent the lives of his friends. Yossarian turns against the [[military]] and refuses to wear a [[uniform]], his justification being he simply \"doesn't want to,\" perhaps because he was traumatized and depressed by Snowden's death. The excuse Captain Korn gives to General Dreedle is that Snowden died in one uniform and his remains had soaked into Yossarian's, and all of Yossarian's other articles of clothing were in the laundry. General Dreedle says \"That sounds like a lot of crap to me.\" Yossarian replies, \"It is a lot of crap, sir.\"\n\n=== Finale ===\nBy the end of the book, just about every other member of his squadron has been killed, disappeared, gone AWOL, or otherwise removed. When Yossarian learns from [[Captain Black (Catch-22)|Captain Black]] that [[Nately's Whore's Kid Sister|Nately's Whore's kid sister]] has been evicted by the Military Police, he flies with [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo]] to Rome, [[AWOL]], to try to save her. He can't find her and ends up walking through the street observing all the horrors that come with war. He gets back to the officers' apartment, where [[Captain Aardvark|Aarfy]] has raped and murdered Michaela.  When the MPs finally come, they do not arrest Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL.\n\nYossarian is forced by [[Colonel Cathcart]] and [[Colonel Korn]] into an odious deal whereby if he acts as their \"pal\" he will be allowed to go home. The deal is designed so the rest of the squadron will not believe Yossarian will be sent home because he has \"turned into such a stubborn son of a bitch\" and refused to fly but because \u2013 being a hero from the Ferrara mission in which he went into the flak zones a second time without support \u2013 he is being sent home as a P.R. representative for the Army.\n\nOn leaving the colonels, Yossarian is badly injured when Nately's whore stabs him and he is rushed to hospital where he recovers and is visited by the [[Chaplain Tappman|Chaplain]] and [[Major Danby]]., who confirms the deal with the colonels is still on but Yossarian wishes not to take it as it lets the rest of the squadron down.\n\nWhile Yossarian is trying to work out how to escape this Catch-22, the Chaplain runs in to announce the missing [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] is alive and well and has rowed his way to neutral Sweden, escaping the war. This gives a new lease on life to the Chaplain, Major Danby and more so to Yossarian who now sees the genius of Orr's plans and makes him determined to escape the war. As Yossarian leaves, Nately's whore again tries to kill him but Yossarian jumps out of the way and runs off.\n\n''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]'' hints the idealistic escape did not occur, with Yossarian saying that when he went home, he was made a major. While Korn and Cathcart are not mentioned, there are implications that perhaps Yossarian took their deal in the end. This reflects more the character of the older Yossarian, who by his late sixties has become a part of the society he spurned in his youth.\n\n==Film portrayal==\nIn [[Mike Nichols]]' 1970 [[Catch-22 (film)|film adaptation of the novel]] Yossarian was played by [[Alan Arkin]], while in the 1973 television series pilot ''Catch-22'', based on the novel and the 1970 film, he was played by [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. [[Christopher Abbott|Christopher Abbot]] plays Yossarian in [[George Clooney]]'s 2019 [[Catch-22 (miniseries)|mini-series]] for Hulu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/news/tv-film/hulu-catch-22-release-date-cast-george-clooney/|title=When is Hulu\u2019s Catch-22 released, who\u2019s in the cast with George Clooney and what\u2019s the trailer?|last=|first=|date=|website=Radio X|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe miniseries version surprisingly portrayed Yossarian as being less sympathetic than either his book or film counterparts. While his desire to leave the war is left intact, he stoops to various lows that end up harming his fellow soldiers as well as some of his superiors. He also has no qualms meeting to Cathcart's demands when offered the chance to permanently leave the war. It is only due to Scheisskopf's intervention that forces him to stay. The ending also changes to him resigning himself to his missions, albeit with him refusing to wear any clothes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{wikiquote-inline|Catch-22}}\n{{Catch-22}}\n\n[[Category:Catch-22 characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Air Force personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War II veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Assyrian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Armenian descent]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2013}}\n:''Also covered in this article are the characters [[Yossarian#Snowden|Snowden]] and [[Yossarian#Yossarian's tentmates|Yossarian's tentmates]].''\n:\n\n'''Capt. John Yossarian'''  is a [[fictional character]], the [[protagonist]] of [[Joseph Heller]]'s satirical novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' and its sequel ''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]''. In ''Catch-22'', Yossarian is a 28-year-old [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|captain]] in the 256th Squadron of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] where he serves as a [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] stationed on the small island of [[Pianosa]] off the [[Italy|Italian]] mainland during [[World War II]]. Yossarian's exploits have previously been thought to be based on the experiences of the author. Heller was also a [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]] in the Army Air Corps, stationed on an island off the coast of [[Italy]] during the war. Heller later documented in his autobiography \"Now & Then\" the elements of Yossarian which came from his experiences (specifically the episodes where Yossarian attends to Snowden during the Avignon mission).  Heller noted that he derived the name Yossarian from a wartime friend and fellow bombardier, Francis Yohannan. Yohannan made the military his career, continuing to serve through the Vietnam War, placing him at odds with Yossarian's feelings towards the military and as noted in his obituary \"(Yohannan) turned aside calls from reporters who asked if he was the real-life Yossarian.\"  A possible source for Yossarian's narrative adventure and efforts to be relieved of his combat duties is Lt. Julius Fish, another bombardier and wartime friend to both Francis Yohannan and Joseph Heller.\n\n== Name ==\nYossarian's first name appears to be \"John,\" since late in ''Catch-22'' Colonel Korn says to him \"Call me Blackie, John. We're pals now.\"\n''Catch-22'' introduces Yossarian as an American soldier in World War II with [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] heritage, although ''Closing Time'' clarifies this to be a joke and that his heritage and surname are in fact [[Armenian people|Armenian]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Heller|authorlink=Joseph Heller|title=[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York City|ISBN=9780743586528|pages=11\u20132, 236}}</ref>\n\nThe exotic name \"Yossarian\" was chosen by Heller to emphasize his protagonist's detachment from mainstream military culture. Yossarian's name is described as \"an odious, alien, distasteful name, that just did not inspire confidence.\" It was \"...not at all like such clean, crisp, honest, American names as Cathcart, Peckem and Dreedle.\" As to the origins of the name, \"Heller admitted in later years that the name 'Yossarian' was derived from the name of one of his Air Force buddies, Francis Yohannan \u2013 an Assyrian \u2013 but that the character of Yossarian himself was 'the incarnation of a wish' (''[[Now and Then (Joseph Heller book)|Now and Then]]'' 175-6).<ref name=Scoggins>Scoggins, Michael C.: \"Joseph Heller\u2019s Combat Experiences in Catch-22\"; ''War, Literature and the Arts'', vol. 15; pg. 223.

I enjoyed it?'|last=|first=|date=|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Character sketch ==\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThroughout the novel, Yossarian's main concern is the idea that people are trying to kill him, either directly (by attacking his plane) or indirectly (by forcing him to fly missions) and he goes to great lengths to stay alive.\n\n=== Goals ===\nYossarian's motivation is to \"live forever or die in the attempt.\" To survive the war, Yossarian employs a number of strategems\n* Postponing dangerous missions by any means possible (e.g. poisoning the squadron and moving the bomb line during the \"Great Big Siege of [[Bologna]]\").\n* Constantly checking into the hospital with contrived liver complaints (\"a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice\"), including the fictitious \"Garnett-Fleischaker syndrome\" and by exploiting the fact he always runs a temperature of 101 degrees [[fahrenheit]] (38 degrees [[celsius]]).\n* Ordering his pilot to perform harsh evasive action in the face of flak, something he will not trust anyone else to do.\n* \"Plotting an emergency heading into [[Switzerland]]\" so he can be interned for the duration of the war \"under conditions of utmost ease and luxury.\"\n\nYossarian, like many of the other soldiers, tries to escape the realities of war by getting drunk, gorging himself in the mess hall and having sex, although events in the novel make it easy to believe he would do these things anyway.\n\n=== Relationships and conflicts ===\nYossarian is in continual conflict with the military policy \"Catch-22,\" a circularly-reasoned bureaucratic trap which his superiors use to justify many of their illogical demands.\n\nThe bulk of ''Catch-22'' concerns Yossarian's relationships with the other officers in his squadron, such as the neurotic [[List of Catch-22 characters|Hungry Joe]], the [[war profiteering|war profiteer]] [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo]], the idealistic [[Nately]] and selfish [[Doc Daneeka]]. There are many characters Yossarian hates and likes. His best friends are [[Dunbar (Catch-22)|Dunbar]], [[Chaplain Tappman]], Nately, Hungry Joe, [[List of Catch-22 characters|McWatt]] and [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]]. Yossarian is greatly saddened when [[List of Catch-22 characters|Clevinger]] and Orr disappear, despite frequently arguing with these characters. He hates the majority of his superiors for putting him in harm's way, especially the sadistic [[Joseph McCarthy|Joe McCarthy]]-like careerist [[Captain Black (Catch-22)|Captain Black]] and the egomaniacal [[Colonel Cathcart]], who continually raises the number of missions required before the aircrews can rotate back home as well as volunteering his aircrews for the most dangerous missions, to make himself look good to his superiors.\n\nYossarian shows particular grief for the men that die during the novel, particularly Snowden, McWatt, Nately, [[Dobbs (Catch-22)|Dobbs]] and Hungry Joe or those who disappear; Orr, Clevinger and Dunbar. While the book tells us nothing of Yossarian's relationship with [[List of Catch-22 characters|Snowden]], it is Yossarian's doomed attempt to save Snowden and his witnessing the latter's gruesome death that forms the emotional centre of the book.\n\n=== Epiphany ===\nAt the end of the novel, Yossarian accepts a deal with [[Colonel Cathcart]] and [[Colonel Korn]] rather than face a court-martial for going [[AWOL]] in [[Rome]]. The deal allows Yossarian to go home but only if he pretends to be \"pals\" to [[Colonel Cathcart]] and [[Colonel Korn]]; to \"become one of the boys.\" Korn explains this means the Army is \"going to glorify you and send you home a hero, recalled by the Pentagon for morale and public-relations purposes.\" It allows Yossarian to get out of the war, without any more contribution to the low morale which has been spreading through the Group because of him and to make the colonels look good to their superiors. Yossarian finds this deal \"odious\" as it lets down all the others in the squadron who were relying on his dissent to force their commanders to treat them better and admits he did it \"in a moment of weakness.\" When he learns the \"official report\" had twisted the event of [[Nately's Whore|Nately's whore]] stabbing him into Yossarian taking a knife wound from a [[Nazi]] assassin to protect the colonels, Yossarian resents being manipulated as \"part of the deal.\"\n\nYossarian's epiphany comes when he hears of [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]]\u2019s escape to [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]], the culmination of Orr's many attempts to escape combat duty (constantly crashing his plane, the prostitute hitting him over the head, etc.) which Yossarian had interpreted as incompetence; Orr had offered hints of this intention in exchanges between the two. Yossarian realizes it is possible to defeat (or at least escape) the military and the Catch-22 that supports it. Yossarian justifies his desertion by stating \"I\u2019m not running away from my responsibilities. I\u2019m running to them. There\u2019s nothing negative about running away to save my life.\"\n\n==In ''Catch-22''==\n{{main|Catch-22}}\nThroughout the book, Yossarian's main concern is the idea that people are trying to kill him, either directly (by attacking his plane) or indirectly (by forcing him to fly missions). His suspicion develops into [[paranoia]] after his attempts to find answers by using logic and reason are thwarted by a combination of vague bureaucracy, transparent yet contradicting [[US Army|Army]] regulations and personality conflicts. He is unable to fly the required number of missions to be discharged from duty, because his superiors keep increasing the number of missions. He cannot obtain a [[section 8 (military)|Section 8]] by pretending to be [[insane]] because his superiors see his desire to get out of flying as a sign of perfect [[sanity]] (hence [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]). Yossarian [[boycott]]s flying missions as much as possible, either through [[Malingering|feigning illness]] or inventing an excuse to return to base (like a busted intercom.) The novel begins with Yossarian staying in the hospital due to an invented [[liver]] condition. He busies himself by arbitrarily censoring letters and signing them [[Washington Irving]], Irving Washington, or (as gets the Chaplain into trouble with authorities) A. T. Tappman, the Chaplain's name (R. O. Shipman in the original version of the book and in British Editions).\n\nWhenever on leave, Yossarian and his friends carouse, drink, and sleep around as much as they can, knowing and fearing they could be killed on the next mission. One of the [[prostitute]]s they employ becomes Nately's unofficial girlfriend (she is referred to only as \"[[Nately's Whore]]\" and \"Nately's Girl\"). Despite Nately's repeated advances, she spurns him cruelly until he, instead of sleeping with her, lets her get a good night's sleep. By the next morning she has fallen deeply in love with him. When Nately is killed, she blames Yossarian for his death; she manifests a towering rage and tries to kill Yossarian several times during the remainder of the narrative in an impossible manner (constantly tracking Yossarian down, even after he dumped her hundreds of miles behind enemy territory.)\n\n===Yossarian's tentmates===\nThe squadron houses its soldiers in large tents. At the start of the novel Yossarian is assigned to a tent with [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] and a third officer referred to as \"The Dead Man in Yossarian's Tent\"{{spnd}}Lt. Mudd{{spnd}}who was sent on a mission immediately upon his arrival and died in combat before he ever even got the official chance to check in. His belongings remain on the bed where he threw them; due to the illogical bureaucratic procedures the armed forces are shown to follow, the belongings cannot be officially removed since Mudd had never officially arrived.\n\nYossarian and Orr get along well and Orr customizes the tent making it much more comfortable. After Orr is declared [[Missing in action|M.I.A.]] and presumed dead, four new officers are assigned to the tent but Yossarian cannot tolerate them. [[Sergeant Towser]] offers Yossarian the option of being assigned to the same tent as [[Nately]] but he refuses to leave.\n\nThe new tentmates call Yossarian \"Yo-Yo\" and are afraid of him and go out of their way to help him, always offering him the warmest expressions of goodwill and generally behaving with intolerable conviviality. They are rambunctious because of their young age and lack of military experience. They tend to like those whom Yossarian hates and fears and do not mind the increasing number of missions. They do what Yossarian and the Air Force were unable to do{{spnd}}get rid of The Dead Man in Yossarian's Tent{{spnd}}by throwing his belongings into the woods.\n\n=== Snowden ===\n{{redirect|Snowden (character)|the snowman|Snowden on Ice}}\nSnowden is a member of Yossarian's flight during a mission and acts as catalyst for the fundamental change in Yossarian's mentality and outlook. After their aircraft is hit by anti-aircraft fire, Snowden is mortally wounded and Yossarian attempts to help by treating a serious leg wound with white bandages and [[sulfanilamide]] powder.\n\nEventually Yossarian notices bleeding from Snowden's armpit and realises he has another wound under his flak suit. As Yossarian rips open the flak suit, a fatal wound beneath exposes Snowden's internal organs which fall out onto the floor. A huge chunk of flak had ripped straight through his ribs from behind. Yossarian is horrified at the sight. Snowden is about to die but is able to tell Yossarian he is cold. Yossarian covers Snowden in a [[parachute]] and comforts him by saying \"there, there.\"\n\nSnowden's death embodies Yossarian's desire to evade death; by seeing Snowden's entrails spilling over the plane, he feels that \"Man was matter, that was Snowden\u2019s secret. Drop him out a window and he\u2019ll fall. Set fire to him and he\u2019ll burn. Bury him and he\u2019ll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden\u2019s secret. Ripeness was all.\"\n\nThe experience on the plane dramatically changes Yossarian's attitude towards life. He looks only to protect his life and to an extent the lives of his friends. Yossarian turns against the [[military]] and refuses to wear a [[uniform]], his justification being he simply \"doesn't want to,\" perhaps because he was traumatized and depressed by Snowden's death. The excuse Captain Korn gives to General Dreedle is that Snowden died in one uniform,and his remains were soaked into Yossarian's and all of Yossarian's other articles of clothing were in the laundry. General Dreedle says \"That sounds like a lot of crap to me.\" Yossarian replies, \"It is a lot of crap, sir.\"\n\n=== Finale ===\nBy the end of the book, just about every other member of his squadron has been killed, disappeared, gone AWOL, or otherwise removed. When Yossarian learns from [[Captain Black (Catch-22)|Captain Black]] that [[Nately's Whore's Kid Sister|Nately's Whore's kid sister]] has been evicted by the Military Police, he flies with [[Milo Minderbinder|Milo]] to Rome, [[AWOL]], to try to save her. He can't find her and ends up walking through the street observing all the horrors that come with war. He gets back to the officers' apartment, where [[Captain Aardvark|Aarfy]] has raped and murdered Michaela.  When the MPs finally come, they do not arrest Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL.\n\nYossarian is forced by [[Colonel Cathcart]] and [[Colonel Korn]] into an odious deal whereby if he acts as their \"pal\" he will be allowed to go home. The deal is designed so the rest of the squadron will not believe Yossarian will be sent home because he has \"turned into such a stubborn son of a bitch\" and refused to fly but because \u2013 being a hero from the Ferrara mission in which he went into the flak zones a second time without support \u2013 he is being sent home as a P.R. representative for the Army.\n\nOn leaving the colonels, Yossarian is badly injured when Nately's whore stabs him and he is rushed to hospital where he recovers and is visited by the [[Chaplain Tappman|Chaplain]] and [[Major Danby]]., who confirms the deal with the colonels is still on but Yossarian wishes not to take it as it lets the rest of the squadron down.\n\nWhile Yossarian is trying to work out how to escape this Catch-22, the Chaplain runs in to announce the missing [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] is alive and well and has rowed his way to neutral Sweden, escaping the war. This gives a new lease on life to the Chaplain, Major Danby and more so to Yossarian who now sees the genius of Orr's plans and makes him determined to escape the war. As Yossarian leaves, Nately's whore again tries to kill him but Yossarian jumps out of the way and runs off.\n\n''[[Closing Time (novel)|Closing Time]]'' hints the idealistic escape did not occur, with Yossarian saying that when he went home, he was made a major. While Korn and Cathcart are not mentioned, there are implications that perhaps Yossarian took their deal in the end. This reflects more the character of the older Yossarian, who by his late sixties has become a part of the society he spurned in his youth.\n\n==Film portrayal==\nIn [[Mike Nichols]]' 1970 [[Catch-22 (film)|film adaptation of the novel]] Yossarian was played by [[Alan Arkin]], while in the 1973 television series pilot ''Catch-22'', based on the novel and the 1970 film, he was played by [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. [[Christopher Abbott|Christopher Abbot]] plays Yossarian in [[George Clooney]]'s 2019 [[Catch-22 (miniseries)|mini-series]] for Hulu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/news/tv-film/hulu-catch-22-release-date-cast-george-clooney/|title=When is Hulu\u2019s Catch-22 released, who\u2019s in the cast with George Clooney and what\u2019s the trailer?|last=|first=|date=|website=Radio X|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe miniseries version surprisingly portrayed Yossarian as being less sympathetic than either his book or film counterparts. While his desire to leave the war is left intact, he stoops to various lows that end up harming his fellow soldiers as well as some of his superiors. He also has no qualms meeting to Cathcart's demands when offered the chance to permanently leave the war. It is only due to Scheisskopf's intervention that forces him to stay. The ending also changes to him resigning himself to his missions, albeit with him refusing to wear any clothes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{wikiquote-inline|Catch-22}}\n{{Catch-22}}\n\n[[Category:Catch-22 characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Air Force personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War II veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Assyrian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Armenian descent]]\n", "name_user": "Fayenatic london", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor copy edits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossarian"}

[[Nikki Wilson]], [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] and Paul Frift served as producers. The series is the eighth to air following the programme's revival in 2005, and is the thirty-fourth season overall. It is also the first series since [[Doctor Who (series 5)|series five]] not to be split into two parts.\n\nThe series is the first to star [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]], an alien [[Time Lord]] who travels through time and space in his [[TARDIS]], which appears to be a British [[police box]] on the outside. It also stars [[Jenna Coleman]] as his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], [[Clara Oswald]]. Also playing a major recurring role in the series is [[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]] as [[Danny Pink]], Clara's boyfriend. The main story arc revolves around a mysterious woman called Missy (portrayed by [[Michelle Gomez]]), who is often seen welcoming people who have died throughout the series to the \"Promised Land\", a place that serves as an apparent afterlife to deceased characters. Missy's true identity is later revealed to be the Doctor's arch-enemy, [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], who has hatched a plan using the help of the [[Cybermen]] and through manipulation of the Doctor and Clara's relationship.\n\nSteven Moffat was directly involved with the writing of seven episodes, with sole credit going to him on four, and the other three where he was credited as a \"co-writer\". Other writers who worked on this series included [[Phil Ford (writer)|Phil Ford]], [[Mark Gatiss]], [[Stephen Thompson (writer)|Stephen Thompson]], [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], [[Peter Harness]], [[Jamie Mathieson]] (who wrote two), and novelist [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]]. Directors of the series included ones who had previously worked with Moffat on the show, and brand new ones. Filming began on 6 January 2014 and lasted exactly seven months, ending on 6 August 2014.\n\nThe series premiere was watched by 9.17 million viewers, the highest ratings for a premiere since [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith's]] [[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|first episode]] as the Doctor back in 2010. Ratings remained consistent throughout the course of the series, seeing a low of 6.71 million viewers with the episode \"[[Flatline (Doctor Who)|Flatline]]\", and ended with 7.60 million people watching the finale (up 150,000 viewers from the [[The Name of the Doctor|previous season finale]]).

Upon Clara's prompting, the robots' cyborg control node, the Half-Face Man, reveals that he is trying to reach the \"promised land\" and killed the dinosaur to use her as parts for his computer. The Doctor confronts the Half-Face Man, claiming the Half-Face Man does not want to continue his existence because of how many times his body was replaced.

[[Nikki Wilson]], [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] and Paul Frift served as producers. The series is the eighth to air following the programme's revival in 2005, and is the thirty-fourth season overall. It is also the first series since [[Doctor Who (series 5)|series five]] not to be split into two parts.\n\nThe series is the first to star [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]], an alien [[Time Lord]] who travels through time and space in his [[TARDIS]], which appears to be a British [[police box]] on the outside. It also stars [[Jenna Coleman]] as his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], [[Clara Oswald]]. Also playing a major recurring role in the series is [[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]] as [[Danny Pink]], Clara's boyfriend. The main story arc revolves around a mysterious woman called Missy (portrayed by [[Michelle Gomez]]), who is often seen welcoming people who have died throughout the series to the \"Promised Land\", a place that serves as an apparent afterlife to deceased characters. Missy's true identity is later revealed to be the Doctor's arch-enemy, [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], who has hatched a plan using the help of the [[Cybermen]] and through manipulation of the Doctor and Clara's relationship.\n\nSteven Moffat was directly involved with the writing of seven episodes, with sole credit going to him on four, and the other three where he was credited as a \"co-writer\".

Filming began on 6 January 2014 and lasted exactly seven months, ending on 6 August 2014.\n\nThe series premiere was watched by 9.17 million viewers, the highest ratings for a premiere since [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith's]] [[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|first episode]] as the Doctor back in 2010. Ratings remained consistent throughout the course of the series, seeing a low of 6.71 million viewers with the episode \"[[Flatline (Doctor Who)|Flatline]]\", and ended with 7.60 million people watching the finale (up 150,000 viewers from the [[The Name of the Doctor|previous season finale]]).

The Doctor and Clara are called to a restaurant, only to find it is part of a spaceship that crashed in the past and is filled with humanoid robots. Upon Clara's prompting, the robots' cyborg control node, the Half-Face Man, reveals that he is trying to reach the \"promised land\" and killed the dinosaur to use her as parts for his computer. The Doctor confronts the Half-Face Man, claiming the Half-Face Man does not want to continue his existence because of how many times his body was replaced. The Half-Face Man falls to his death from an hot-air balloon, and the other robots go lifeless. Unsure about continuing to travel with the new Doctor, Clara is convinced by a phone call from the [[Eleventh Doctor]].

The Doctor brings Clara to the human rebel ship ''Aristotle'' to help the \"good\" [[Dalek]] Rusty, despite the Doctor's contention that Daleks cannot be turned good. The Doctor, Clara, and a team of rebels from the ''Aristotle'' are miniaturised and sent into Rusty. The Doctor repairs Rusty's power cell, but it reverts to its old way of thinking and forgets the memory of seeing the beauty of a star being born that had made it want to destroy the other Daleks.

Ambulatory passageways for circumambulation are present through which worshipers move  in a clockwise direction, starting at the sanctuary doorway and moving inward toward the [[sanctum sanctorum|inner sanctum]] where the deity is enshrined. This is a translation of the spiritual concept of transition through levels in life into bodily movements  by the worshipers as they move inwardly through ambulatory halls to the most sacred centre of spiritual energy of the deity.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Michell | first =George  | title =The Hindu Temple  | publisher =University of Chicago Press  | year =1988  | location =Chicago, Illinois  | isbn = 1477470573  | page = 66 }}</ref> Circumambulation is done in a clockwise direction and in an odd rather than even number of times. Circumambulatory walking around the shrine, by keeping time, is a common form of Hindu prayer. The circumambulatory pathway made of stone around the shrine is called the [[Pradakshina]] path.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent  - glossary|publisher=indoarch.org|accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref>\n\n==Christianity==\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], a [[Catholic priest|priest]] sometimes circumambulates an altar while incensing it with a [[thurible]]. Also, at some Catholic shrines, it is a tradition to circumambulate around the cult object of the place, usually relics of a saint or an image of [[Jesus]] or the [[Virgin Mary]]. Often this is performed three times, as a reference to the [[Trinity]].\n\nIn [[Romania]], there is an [[Easter]] custom to circumambulate the church three times by singing priests leading the people, just before finishing Easter Mass. It symbolizes the funerary procession of the burial of Jesus Christ.<ref>http://www.crestinortodox.ro/paste/saptamana-patimilor/slujba-prohodului-88660.html</ref>\n\nCircumambulation is common in many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] services. In the [[Copts|Coptic]] tradition, during the [[liturgy]], the priest circumambulates while an [[acolyte]] ([[altar boy]]) holds a cross high on the opposite side of the altar.\n\nThis is also a common practice in Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches during [[Lent]] when [[Stations of the Cross|stations of the cross]] services are celebrated.  The priest along with altar servers process around the circumambulate around the interior of the church visiting each of the 14 stations.\n\nOn [[Palm Sunday]] in the churches of many [[Christian denominations]], members of the congregation, oftentimes children, are given palms that they carry as they walk in a procession around the inside of the church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/palm-sunday-marks-start-of-holy-week.html|title=Palm Sunday Marks Start of Holy Week|website=christianpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womansday.com/life/a26557005/when-is-palm-sunday/|title=When Is Palm Sunday?

During the [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]], [[Muslims]] are to circumambulate the [[Kaaba]] ([[Most holy place#Islam|most sacred site]] in [[Islam]]) seven times, in a [[Clockwise|counter-clockwise]] direction.<ref name=\"Bowker\"/><ref>World Faiths, teach yourself - Islam by Ruqaiyyah Maqsood. {{ISBN|0-340-60901-X}} page 76</ref> The circling is believed to demonstrate the unity of the believers in the worship of the One God, as they move in harmony together around the Kaaba, while supplicating to Allah.\n\n==Judaism==\nJudaism uses circumambulation in the [[Hakafot]] ritual during the Festival of [[Sukkot]] culminating in seven [[Hakafot]] on [[Hoshanah Rabbah]], the end of the Festival. The circumambulations are also performed during Hakafot on [[Simchat Torah]], where Jews dance often by circumambulating the Torah Scrolls. Traditionally, Jewish brides circumambulate their grooms during the wedding ceremony under the [[chuppah]] and much Jewish dancing at weddings and Bar Mitzvahs is done by moving in a circle.\n\n==Buddhism==\n{{main|Parikrama}}\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Ground plan of [[Borobudur]] showing the 9 platforms, each of which can be circumambulated, and the large central stupa]]\n\nAlso called ''pradak\u1e63ina'' or ''ca\u1e45krama\u1e47a'' in [[Sanskrit]].\n\nIn [[Zen Buddhism]], ''jund\u014d'' (\u5de1\u5802) can mean any ritual circuit or circumambulation. At Tassajara each morning, the officiating priest (\u5c0e\u5e2b ''d\u014dshi'') visits four different altars on their way to the [[zend\u014d]], to make bows and offerings of incense. This jund\u014d begins with the first rolldown of the han{{clarify|date=July 2019}}, and ends as the d\u014dshi enters the zend\u014d with the third rolldown. After offering incense and bowing at the altar, the ''d\u014dshi'' walks around the zend\u014d behind the meditators, in what is called the ''kentan'' (\u691c\u5358), ''inspection of the sitting platform''.

Ambulatory passageways for circumambulation are present through which worshipers move  in a clockwise direction, starting at the sanctuary doorway and moving inward toward the [[sanctum sanctorum|inner sanctum]] where the deity is enshrined. This is a translation of the spiritual concept of transition through levels in life into bodily movements  by the worshipers as they move inwardly through ambulatory halls to the most sacred centre of spiritual energy of the deity.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Michell | first =George  | title =The Hindu Temple  | publisher =University of Chicago Press  | year =1988  | location =Chicago, Illinois  | isbn = 1477470573  | page = 66 }}</ref> Circumambulation is done in a clockwise direction and in an odd rather than even number of times. Circumambulatory walking around the shrine, by keeping time, is a common form of Hindu prayer. The circumambulatory pathway made of stone around the shrine is called the [[Pradakshina]] path.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php|title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent  - glossary|publisher=indoarch.org|accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref>\n\n==Christianity==\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], a [[Catholic priest|priest]] sometimes circumambulates an altar while incensing it with a [[thurible]]. Also, at some Catholic shrines, it is a tradition to circumambulate around the cult object of the place, usually relics of a saint or an image of [[Jesus]] or the [[Virgin Mary]]. Often this is performed three times, as a reference to the [[Trinity]].\n\nIn [[Romania]], there is an [[Easter]] custom to circumambulate the church three times by singing priests leading the people, just before finishing Easter Mass. It symbolizes the funerary procession of the burial of Jesus Christ.<ref>http://www.crestinortodox.ro/paste/saptamana-patimilor/slujba-prohodului-88660.html</ref>\n\nCircumambulation is common in many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] services. In the [[Copts|Coptic]] tradition, during the [[liturgy]], the priest circumambulates while an [[acolyte]] ([[altar boy]]) holds a cross high on the opposite side of the altar.\n\nThis is also a common practice in Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches during [[Lent]] when [[Stations of the Cross|stations of the cross]] services are celebrated.  The priest along with altar servers process around the circumambulate around the interior of the church visiting each of the 14 stations.\n\nOn [[Palm Sunday]] in the churches of many [[Christian denominations]], members of the congregation, oftentimes children, are given palms that they carry as they walk in a procession around the inside of the church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/palm-sunday-marks-start-of-holy-week.html|title=Palm Sunday Marks Start of Holy Week|website=www.christianpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womansday.com/life/a26557005/when-is-palm-sunday/|title=When Is Palm Sunday?

The circumambulations are also performed during Hakafot on [[Simchat Torah]], where Jews dance often by circumambulating the Torah Scrolls. Traditionally, Jewish brides circumambulate their grooms during the wedding ceremony under the [[chuppah]] and much Jewish dancing at weddings and Bar Mitzvahs is done by moving in a circle.\n\n==Buddhism==\n{{main|Parikrama}}\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Ground plan of [[Borobudur]] showing the 9 platforms, each of which can be circumambulated, and the large central stupa]]\n\nAlso called ''pradak\u1e63ina'' or ''ca\u1e45krama\u1e47a'' in [[Sanskrit]].\n\nIn [[Zen Buddhism]], ''jund\u014d'' (\u5de1\u5802) can mean any ritual circuit or circumambulation. At Tassajara each morning, the officiating priest (\u5c0e\u5e2b ''d\u014dshi'') visits four different altars on their way to the [[zend\u014d]], to make bows and offerings of incense. This jund\u014d begins with the first rolldown of the han{{clarification needed|date=July 2019}}, and ends as the d\u014dshi enters the zend\u014d with the third rolldown. After offering incense and bowing at the altar, the ''d\u014dshi'' walks around the zend\u014d behind the meditators, in what is called the ''kentan'' (\u691c\u5358), ''inspection of the sitting platform''. As the d\u014dshi passes, each resident raises their hands in [[A\u00f1jali Mudr\u0101|gassh\u014d]] (\u5408\u638c) without bowing.
