The focus is on [[Player versus player|player vs. player]] gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle.\n\n''World of Tanks'' has been ported to multiple gaming consoles. The [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] version, called '''''World of Tanks Mercenaries''''', was developed by studio [[Wargaming West]]. ''World of Tanks'' has also expanded to mobile platforms under the title '''''World of Tanks Blitz''''', in addition to a board game titled '''''World of Tanks Rush''''' and a [[collectible card game]] titled '''''World of Tanks: Generals'''''. ''World of Tanks'' was followed by ''[[World of Warplanes]]'' and ''[[World of Warships]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe player takes control of a single armored vehicle of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle's movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team's base. There are other game modes that change the rules of the battle, but gameplay mechanics remain the same. ''World of Tanks'' contains multiple game mechanics such as camouflage, shell ricochets, and module damage.\n\nThe players in ''World of Tanks'' can choose six primary types of battles: random battles, team-training battles, tank-company battles, team battles, stronghold battles and special battles. Historical Battle and Rampage are former options but have since been taken down for improvement upon its poor reception following its release. Within random battles, players can also participate in platoons, groups of two to three players who are put into the same team. There are also missions to be completed in the game modes for varying amounts of rewards.\n\n=== Vehicles ===\nThe vehicles are modeled to closely resemble their counterparts in real life;<ref>{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Seraphina |date=18 February 2010 |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/18/world-of-tanks-rolls-onto-the-mmo-battlefield/ |title=World of Tanks rolls onto the MMO battlefield |website=[[Engadget]] ([[Joystiq]]) |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> however, certain parameters have been simplified or modified to fit game mechanics, and better gameplay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://worldoftanks.com/en/content/guide/general/frequently_asked_questions/ |title=World of Tanks FAQ |website=World of Tanks |publisher=Wargaming |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> ''World of Tanks'' has five different types of vehicles: [[light tank]]s, [[medium tank]]s, [[heavy tank]]s, [[tank destroyer]]s, and [[self-propelled gun]]s, as well as a few [[main battle tank]]s. The game currently includes over 600 armored vehicles from Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States. Each nation has at least one line of vehicles starting at tier I to tier X, players progress by playing games in vehicles in that line.\n\nAll vehicles can be customized to a certain degree, either visually or in terms of performance, with the majority of parts (such as tracks, guns, turrets, and engines) being modular parts purchased from the game's tech tree. Various two-tone and three-tone camouflage schemes are available for all tanks as well, including both historically accurate patterns and game-specific, custom variants. [[Camouflage]] is available for temporary use by paying with freely earned in-game credits, or for permanent use by paying with gold purchased in the ''World of Tanks'' store or won in an in-game event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/general-news/prepare-yourselves-some-stealthy-tanks/|title=Prepare yourselves for some stealthy tanks|date=1 November 2011|website=World of Tanks|publisher=Wargaming|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> Players can apply national flags, pre-designed slogans, and camouflage (that will slightly increase the chance of remaining undetected).\n\nAll vehicles can mount three pieces of additional equipment, which varies from vehicle to vehicle, and offers various advantages. Some equipment allow the gun to fire faster, some increase the durability of certain parts of the vehicle, and some help keep the vehicle hidden while stationary. Each vehicle can carry three consumables. Examples of these include repair kits, medical kits, and extra rations that boost the tank's crew for the duration of a single battle.\n\n===Clan Wars===\nClan Wars in ''World of Tanks'' has two main components: Strongholds and the Global Map. Each clan can have its own stronghold, if the clan's commander wishes to construct one. Each stronghold begins with one zone and can grow to up to four zones as the clan's membership increases. Many different types of structures exist; however, only one of each can be built. By consuming industrial resources, some structures generate special missions or reserves that can be used to temporarily boost clan members' experience or credits, or enable artillery or airstrikes during a battle for a stronghold. To build structures, industrial resources are required, which can be won by attacking another stronghold or through skirmishes.\n\nThe Global Map is a collection of fronts on a map based on the real world. There are three fronts, one each for tiers 6, 8, and 10. Each front has provinces that generate gold for the clan that currently owns it. A clan may enter the global map by entering a tournament for a specific province, in which they compete against other clans and ultimately the current landowner.\n\n==History==\n{{update section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Wikia-Gamescom-2017-Wednesday-014 (35929619014).jpg|thumb|''World of Tanks'' play area at [[gamescom]] 2017|alt=]]\n\nThe developers thought of the concept of ''World of Tanks'' in December 2008.<ref name=\"gamestar.ru\">{{cite web |url=http://gamestar.ru/article/1199.html |title=\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0441 Wargaming \u043e World of Tanks |language=Russian |website=[[GameStar]] |date=31 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68TGB1pnW?url=http://gamestar.ru/article/1199.html |archivedate=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> The game was officially announced by [[Wargaming (company)|Wargaming]] on 24 April 2009.

The focus is on [[Player versus player|player vs. player]] gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle.\n\n''World of Tanks'' has been ported to multiple gaming consoles. The [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] version, called '''''World of Tanks Mercenaries''''', was developed by studio [[Wargaming West]]. ''World of Tanks'' has also expanded to mobile platforms under the title '''''World of Tanks Blitz''''', in addition to a board game titled '''''World of Tanks Rush''''' and a [[collectible card game]] titled '''''World of Tanks: Generals'''''. ''World of Tanks'' was followed by ''[[World of Warplanes]]'' and ''[[World of Warships]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe player takes control of a single armored vehicle of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle's movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team's base. There are other game modes that change the rules of the battle, but gameplay mechanics remain the same. ''World of Tanks'' contains multiple game mechanics such as camouflage, shell ricochets, and module damage.\n\nThe players in ''World of Tanks'' can choose six primary types of battles: random battles, team-training battles, tank-company battles, team battles, stronghold battles and special battles. Historical Battle and Rampage are former options but have since been taken down for improvement upon its poor reception following its release. Within random battles, players can also participate in platoons, groups of two to three players who are put into the same team. There are also missions to be completed in the game modes for varying amounts of rewards.\n\n=== Vehicles ===\nThe vehicles are modeled to closely resemble their counterparts in real life;<ref>{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Seraphina |date=18 February 2010 |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/18/world-of-tanks-rolls-onto-the-mmo-battlefield/ |title=World of Tanks rolls onto the MMO battlefield |website=[[Engadget]] ([[Joystiq]]) |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> however, certain parameters have been simplified or modified to fit game mechanics, and better gameplay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://worldoftanks.com/en/content/guide/general/frequently_asked_questions/ |title=World of Tanks FAQ |website=World of Tanks |publisher=Wargaming |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> ''World of Tanks'' has five different types of vehicles: [[light tank]]s, [[medium tank]]s, [[heavy tank]]s, [[tank destroyer]]s, and [[self-propelled gun]]s, as well as a few [[main battle tank]]s. The game currently includes over 600 armored vehicles from Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States. Each nation has at least one line of vehicles starting at tier I to tier X, players progress by playing games in vehicles in that line.\n\nAll vehicles can be customized to a certain degree, either visually or in terms of performance, with the majority of parts (such as tracks, guns, turrets, and engines) being modular parts purchased from the game's tech tree. Various two-tone and three-tone camouflage schemes are available for all tanks as well, including both historically accurate patterns and game-specific, custom variants. [[Camouflage]] is available for temporary use by paying with freely earned in-game credits, or for permanent use by paying with gold purchased in the ''World of Tanks'' store or won in an in-game event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/general-news/prepare-yourselves-some-stealthy-tanks/|title=Prepare yourselves for some stealthy tanks|date=1 November 2011|website=World of Tanks|publisher=Wargaming|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> Players can apply national flags, pre-designed slogans, and camouflage (that will slightly increase the chance of remaining undetected).\n\nAll vehicles can mount three pieces of additional equipment, which varies from vehicle to vehicle, and offers various advantages. Some equipment allow the gun to fire faster, some increase the durability of certain parts of the vehicle, and some help keep the vehicle hidden while stationary. Each vehicle can carry three consumables. Examples of these include repair kits, medical kits, and extra rations that boost the tank's crew for the duration of a single battle.\n\n===Clan Wars===\nClan Wars in ''World of Tanks'' has two main components: Strongholds and the Global Map. Each clan can have its own stronghold, if the clan's commander wishes to construct one. Each stronghold begins with one zone and can grow to up to four zones as the clan's membership increases. Many different types of structures exist; however, only one of each can be built. By consuming industrial resources, some structures generate special missions or reserves that can be used to temporarily boost clan members' experience or credits, or enable artillery or airstrikes during a battle for a stronghold. To build structures, industrial resources are required, which can be won by attacking another stronghold or through skirmishes.\n\nThe Global Map is a collection of fronts on a map based on the real world. There are three fronts, one each for tiers 6, 8, and 10. Each front has provinces that generate gold for the clan that currently owns it. A clan may enter the global map by entering a tournament for a specific province, in which they compete against other clans and ultimately the current landowner.\n\n==History==\n{{update section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Wikia-Gamescom-2017-Wednesday-014 (35929619014).jpg|thumb|''World of Tanks'' play area at [[gamescom]] 2017|alt=]]\n\nThe developers thought of the concept of ''World of Tanks'' in December 2008.<ref name=\"gamestar.ru\">{{cite web |url=http://gamestar.ru/article/1199.html |title=\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0441 Wargaming \u043e World of Tanks |language=Russian |website=[[GameStar]] |date=31 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68TGB1pnW?url=http://gamestar.ru/article/1199.html |archivedate=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> The game was officially announced by [[Wargaming (company)|Wargaming]] on 24 April 2009.

It began with the [[The Lego Movie|2014 film of the same name]], which was directed and written by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]]. The success of the film led it to receiving two licensed video games, a [[The Lego Movie: 4D \u2013 A New Adventure|theme park film ride attraction]], two spin-off films which were released in 2017, an [[Unikitty!|animated series]] that also came out in the same year as well as a [[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part|sequel]] in 2019 among other pieces of media. A third spin-off film as well as a sequel to ''The Lego Batman Movie'' are in development. The films in the franchise have received generally positive critical reception, with the exception of ''Ninjago'' which acquired mixed reviews, and has grossed $1 billion at the worldwide box office. It is produced and owned by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Film\n! U.S. <br />release date\n!

The shirt was mainly red with a large yellow stripe down both sleeves with blue being used for the short colour and the stripe running down each side of the top. The badge also uses the state colours in a stylised swoosh, above what appears to be a football made with the [[Southern Cross]], as opposed to the traditional hexagonal panels of a football.

United's kit has moved towards a predominately all-red kit, both top and shorts, with black trim. Originally, the away strip was predominantly white, with red sleeves and yellow trim however in 2009 the club launched a predominantly black 'clash' strip.\n\nThe launch of the new national league also saw Adelaide launch a new badge; while keeping a similar look and feel as its predecessor the new badge takes the form of more traditional football badge with its shield like border.\n\nAdelaide United is most commonly referred to as \"The Reds\" because of their predominantly red playing kit. In February 2009 the club's head coach, Aurelio Vidmar referred to the City of Adelaide as a \"Pissant Town\" after suffering a heartbreaking loss. The club's supporters eventually utilised the name \"Pissants\" as a term of endearment and it became an unofficial nickname of the club between its supporters.\n\n===Kit suppliers and shirt

The NSL came to an end at the completion of the 2003\u201304 season after 28 seasons with The Reds only competing in the final season as governing body [[Football Federation Australia|Australian Soccer Association]] (later Football Federation Australia) shut down the league in preparation for the launch of the fully professional [[A-League]] almost 12 months later, on 26 August 2005.\n\n===2005\u20132010===\nAdelaide United were announced as one of eight teams to compete in the first season of the A-League, and are, along with the Perth Glory and [[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]], one of only three teams to survive from the National Soccer League's last season. United began preparation earlier than most of the other clubs and had announced two thirds of the 20 man squad before February 2005.\n\nThe club focused on bringing several Adelaide born players back to South Australia, such as [[Angelo Costanzo]], [[Travis Dodd]] and [[Lucas Pantelis]], who had previously played for Adelaide City SC in the NSL. [[Shengqing Qu]] was signed from [[China|Chinese]] club [[Shanghai Shenhua]] as the clubs \"marquee\" signing (a ruling allowing each club one player to be paid outside the salary cap) in March 2005.\n\n[[Aurelio Vidmar]] announced his retirement before the A-League had even started. He was replaced before the fifth round by striker [[Fernando Rech|Fernando]] from Brazil, a former 'player of the year' in the old NSL. By moving to Adelaide, he was reunited with former coach [[John Kosmina]] who introduced him to Australian audiences at the Brisbane Strikers.\n\nAdelaide United Director Mel Patzwald established links with American club [[Miami FC (2006)|Miami FC]], setting up a 'sister club' relationship, with whom they played a number of friendlies and leading to signing [[Diego Walsh|Diego]] from them. The team also signed Brazilian legend [[Rom\u00e1rio]] for a 5-game guest stint in November/December 2006. Furthermore, through Mel's connections established a sister club relationship with Chinese club and reigning Asian champions at the time Shandong Luneng.\n\nContinuing their good form from the final season of the NSL, Adelaide United finished as Premiers in the inaugural season of the Hyundai A-League.

The shirt was mainly red with a large yellow stripe down both sleeves with blue being used for the short colour and the stripe running down each side of the top. The badge also uses the state colours in a stylised swoosh, above what appears to be a football made with the [[Southern Cross]], as opposed to the traditional hexagonal panels of a football.

United's kit has moved towards a predominately all-red kit, both top and shorts, with black trim. Originally, the away strip was predominantly white, with red sleeves and yellow trim however in 2009 the club launched a predominantly black 'clash' strip.\n\nThe launch of the new national league also saw Adelaide launch a new badge; while keeping a similar look and feel as its predecessor the new badge takes the form of more traditional football badge with its shield like border.\n\nAdelaide United is most commonly referred to as \"The Reds\" because of their predominantly red playing kit. In February 2009 the club's head coach, Aurelio Vidmar referred to the City of Adelaide as a \"Pissant Town\" after suffering a heartbreaking loss. The club's supporters eventually utilised the name \"Pissants\" as a term of endearment and it became an unofficial nickname of the club between its supporters.\n\n===Kit suppliers and shirt
