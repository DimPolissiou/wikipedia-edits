The town was founded during Roman times and the Catholic church in the town center is built on the ruins of the Roman founded temple. During the 1525-1665 period the area was occupied by the invading Turks. This mainly agricultural town has the ruins of a castle torn mostly down after the 1848-1849 revolution by the conquering Austrians. There is a look-out tower on the top of the \"Varhegy\"- castle hill next to the thermal bath and the town, the  vineyards and their wine cellars can be see well from this point. The Soviet Army controlled the town from 1945-1989 until the Soviet eastern bloc fell. Since that time the country and the area have been governed by a Western style parliamentary democracy. Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe main tourist attraction of Tam\u00e1si is the spa and open-air bath. It is one of the well attended country spas of Hungary. The excellent natural environment, the health-providing quality of the water and the superb surrounding has made Tam\u00e1si a known internationally attended curing spa. The thermal water is 52 Celsius warm and very healthy. The special health-improving quality of the water is due to its high sodium, calcium and potassium concentration. The 7 hectare wood-land of the bath is open all year round, where open-air pools, stretched-surfaced water-pools, separate children's pool are located. 6&nbsp;km long cycle path connects Tam\u00e1si and a small village (P\u00e1ri) and crosses the wonderful landscape.\n\nMost renowned among the natural beauties of the area is the Gyulaj Forest wild animal preserve, formerly owned by the famous Estherh\u00e1zy family for hunting. During the Communist period of 1945-1989 party officials from Budapest came down in organized large hunting parties and held great eating and drinking feasts after the hunt photos of which can be seen in the host lodge. On its territory of 7.8 hectares (oak and elm varieties), lives one of the world's largest population of fallow deer called d\u00e1m vad. Water-birds (ferruginous duck, Nyroca n.nyroca, herons Egretta) and predatory birds (hawks, Accipiter sp., bald eagle, Heliaeetus leucocephalus) are seen at the nearby Pacsmag lake area. Bird watching camps are organised here, guided by specialised ornithologists.\n\n== Notable current and former residents ==\n* [[Andrea Osv\u00e1rt]], Hungarian actress\n* [[Ernie Konnyu]], retired American Congressman and California State Assemblyman of San Jose, CA USA was born here in 1937.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barone |first1=Michael |author-link1=Michael Barone (pundit) |last2=Ujifusa |first2=Grant |title=[[The Almanac of American Politics]] 1988|publisher=[[National Journal]] |year=1987 |page=107}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.tamasi.hu/}} in Hungarian, English and German\n* [http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=24563 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n* [http://nava.hu/id/1814014/ Tamasi 20 minute video] {{in lang|hu}}\n\n{{Tam\u00e1si District}}\n{{Tolna}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tamasi}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Tolna County]]\n\n\n{{Tolna-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{for|the commune in [[Bac\u0103u County]], [[Romania]]|Tama\u0219i}}\n{{advert|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|settlement_type = [[List of cities and towns of Hungary|Town]]\n|image_skyline = Tam\u00e1si l\u00e9gifot\u00f33.jpg\n|image_caption = Tam\u00e1si from bird's eye view\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = {{HUN}}\n|timezone=[[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset=+1\n|timezone_DST=[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+2\n|official_name=Tam\u00e1si\n|image_shield=HUN Tam\u00e1si C\u00edmer.svg\n|image_flag = Flag of Tam\u00e1si.svg\n|map=[[Image:TolnaMegye.png|center|thumb|275px|Location of Tolna county in Hungary]]\n|subdivision_type1=[[Counties of Hungary|County]]\n|subdivision_name1=[[Tolna County|Tolna]]\n|subdivision_type2=[[Districts of Hungary|District]]\n|subdivision_name2=[[Tam\u00e1si District|Tam\u00e1si]]\n|area_total_km2=125.01\n|population_total=9626\n|population_footnotes=\n|population_as_of=2004\n|population_density_km2=77\n|postal_code_type=[[Postal codes in Hungary|Postal code]]\n|postal_code=7090\n|area_code_type=[[Telephone numbers in Hungary|Area code]]\n|area_code=(+36) 74\n|website={{URL|http://www.tamasi.hu/}}\n|pushpin_map            =Hungary \n|pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location of Tam\u00e1si\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|coordinates            = {{coord|46.62319|18.30474|region:HU|display=inline,title}}\n}}\n'''Tam\u00e1si''' is a town in [[Tolna County]], [[Hungary]].\n\nTam\u00e1si, named after St. Thomas, with a population of approximately 9200 is located just 30 kilometers East of Lake Balaton.
