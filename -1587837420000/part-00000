Few could have imagined the effect it would have on Colombian history. After the battle, the war took a 180-degree-turn, and became one of the most brutal conflicts in early 20th century South America.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the victory of Peralonso (December 15, 1899), the Liberals could have finished the war, completing the Conservative defeat by marching unopposed on the capital. General Vargas Santos,  commander of a Liberal army, believed it was dishonorable to attack the dispersed government army, and ordered that his troops move to C\u00facuta, many kilometers from the site of the battle.\n\nWhen finally in February, fighting off mosquitoes and fever, the General decided to begin small skirmishes, a new Conservative army, fresh and well supplied, under the command of the general Pr\u00f3spero Pinz\u00f3n, had cut off all routes of escape.\n\n==In the darkness==\nOn May 11, 1900, the Liberal advance arrived at the outposts in the Canta mountains, in between [[Bucaramanga]] and Lebrija, and there began the most prolonged battle of the war. Fifteen days of combat on a front of 26 kilometers of trenches occurred in the rustic topography of the hills of Palonegro. There, the victory swung with every meter lost or gained, and where [[machete]]s and [[yatagan]]es created a slaughter between both sides.\n\nThe burning sun overhead, the suffocating heat, the lack of equipment, the deficiency of efficient \"ambulances\" and the canteens full of a mixture of brandy with powder all combined with the brutality of a combat where the cutting weapon amputated members and cleaved flesh, condemning its victims to a slow death between the ditches. Long before the end of the battle, the stench of the dead, who shared the trenches with the living, poisoned the air of the region, and darkened the sky with carrion birds, many became anchored to earth because the weight of their banquets was greater than the force of their wings.\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:2-palonegro-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Soldiers during the battle of Palonegro]] -->\n\nAfter the battle, the doctors who took care of the wounded and buried the dead told chilling stories of the brutal viciousness of the battle. Dead fathers lying next to their deceased adolescent sons, inhabitants of the region looting the corpses of the dead, thousands of corpses covered with flies that laid eggs and ate to multiply their species. They told of women gathering, like in a puzzle, the pieces of their relatives to bury them complete, or those who tried to imagine, between the bodies disfigured by the swelling, some characteristic that identified them with their loved ones.\n\nMany sources put the dead at 2,500(1,500 Liberals and 1,000 Conservatives). This is the result of the battle that reached its end on May 26 when the Liberals began to abandon their positions in order to retreat.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOf all the routes of escape, general Vargas Santos opted for the least expected: the jungle of Teorama. There the Liberals left the fury and the fever that it had when it defeated the Conservative army at the battle of Peralonso.\n\nThat day, May 26, 1900, the situation deteriorated even further. The future of the war had been sealed, the defeat of the Liberals was only a matter of time. It began a devastating war that only existed to prolong the confrontation and to look for the conditions for an honorable peace, that became less and less feasible because the Liberal armies were forces in permanent defeat.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/historia/manusancle.htm {{in lang|es}} http://www.presidencia.gov.co (Page contains information on number of participants in battle)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050319102346/http://www.colombialink.com/01_INDEX/index_historia/07_otros_hechos_historicos/0110_batalla_palonegro.html {{in lang|es}} http://www.colombialink.com (LA BATALLA DE PALONEGRO)]\n\n{{coord missing|Colombia}}\n\n[[Category:Thousand Days' War|Palonegro]]\n[[Category:1900 in Colombia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Tone|date=December 2007}}\n\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Battle of Palonegro\n| image= Visperas batalla palonegro.jpg\n| image_size = 275\n|caption=Conservative soldiers before the battle\n|partof=[[Thousand Days War]]\n|date=11-26 May 1900\n|place=[[Santander Department]], [[Colombia]]\n|result=Conservative victory\n|combatant1=[[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberals]]\n|combatant2=[[Image:Colconservparty.png|20px]] [[Colombian Conservative Party]]\n|commander1=Gabriel Vergas Santos\n|commander2= Nelly Guerra alias Bronquitirofijo (cabecilla de las FARC)\n|strength1=8,000\n|strength2=15,000\n|casualties1=1,500\n|casualties2=1,000\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Thousand Days War}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Palonegro''' started on May 11 and ended on May 26, 1900, in the early days of the [[Thousand Days War]], the commanding general of the Liberal armies, Gabriel Vargas Santos, ordered his troops to retire to Palonegro, near the city of [[Bucaramanga]] in the [[Santander Department]] of Colombia.

Known for achieving a polished radio friendly sound, many of the acts he has worked with have enjoyed a moderate amount of commercial success.\n\n==Life and career==\nSteve Kravac was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, a suburb of the City of Vancouver. He attended [[Burnaby North Secondary School]] and while in high school began playing drums and founded his first band, Social Outcasts who played locally in support of punk acts [[D.O.A. (band)|DOA]] and the [[Angelic Upstarts]]. He graduated in 1982, and shortly thereafter moved across Canada to the city [[Montreal]] where he resided for twelve years.\n\nWhile in Montreal he attended [[Concordia University]] for two years studying photography and film before leaving the school to pursue music as a full-time career. At this time he began working on his first commercial productions including records from Canadian bands [[Doughboys]], [[Asexuals (band)|Asexuals]] and [[Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra]]. He also joined the punk band My Dog Popper, and played drums on two records as well as performing live with the group and in their side project Johnny Neon Beef. Later he would join forces with noted Canadian songwriter [[Alex Soria]] of the band [[The Nils]]. to form Los Patos,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnpaulcampbell.wordpress.com/2005/03/22/the-post-memorial-week/ |title=The Post-Memorial Week \" From the Margins |publisher=Johnpaulcampbell.wordpress.com |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> a pop rock music vehicle for Soria's songs. The line up consisted of Soria on guitar and vocals, Stephan (Hams) Hamel on bass and Kravac on drums and background vocals. The project was short lived, but one commercial track was released, a cover of Donovan's \"Changes\" which was on Island of Circles, a tribute album to Donovan released on the [[Vancouver]], B.C.-based [[Nettwerk Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/island-of-circles-a-nettwork-compilation-r179308 |title=Island of Circles: A Nettwork Compilation \u2013 Donovan |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994 shortly after the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, a recording engineer position became available at [[Westbeach Recorders]]. Well known in the punk rock community, Westbeach was located in Hollywood and co-owned by [[Brett Gurewitz]] of [[Epitaph Records]] and his business partner, noted recording engineer [[Donnell Cameron]]. With a little prompting from Youth Brigade drummer Mark Stern, Donnell asked Kravac to forward him a demo reel of his work. Cameron was impressed enough with the contents of the demo to offer Kravac a position at Westbeach and three months later in March 1994 Kravac moved to Los Angeles to take the job.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevekravac.com/BIO.html |title=BIO |publisher=Stevekravac.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nKravac would remain at Westbeach for the next five years and during that time began recording some of the acts that he would eventually be best known for working with. One of the first sessions he engineered upon arrival in L.A. was the album \"Cheshire Cat\" by [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veerob.com/blink182.com/discog/cheshire.html |title=Blink-182 \u2013 Discography \u2013 Cheshire Cat |publisher=Veerob.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> The record released on Cargo Records went on to be a successful release for the band and provided a springboard to other production and engineering opportunities.\n\nOne of those opportunities was with the record label Tooth and Nail, a Christian music label based in Seattle Washington. Kravac produced a number of bands for the label including [[The O.C. Supertones]] album \"Supertones Strike Back\" which was nominated for a Dove award for Modern Rock/Alternative record of the year, in 1998 by the Gospel Music Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/o-c-supertones-reference/o-c-supertones |title=The O.C.

Known for achieving a polished radio friendly sound, many of the acts he has worked with have enjoyed a moderate amount of commercial success.\n\n==Life and career==\nSteve Kravac was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, a suburb of the City of Vancouver. He attended [[Burnaby North Secondary School]] and while in high school began playing drums and founded his first band, Social Outcasts who played locally in support of punk acts [[D.O.A. (band)|DOA]] and the [[Angelic Upstarts]]. He graduated in 1982, and shortly thereafter moved across Canada to the city [[Montreal]] where he resided for twelve years.\n\nWhile in Montreal he attended [[Concordia University]] for two years studying photography and film before leaving the school to pursue music as a full-time career. At this time he began working on his first commercial productions including records from Canadian bands [[Doughboys]], [[Asexuals (band)|Asexuals]] and [[Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra]]. He also joined the punk band My Dog Popper, and played drums on two records as well as performing live with the group and in their side project Johnny Neon Beef. Later he would join forces with noted Canadian songwriter [[Alex Soria]] of the band [[The Nils]]. to form Los Patos,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnpaulcampbell.wordpress.com/2005/03/22/the-post-memorial-week/ |title=The Post-Memorial Week \" From the Margins |publisher=Johnpaulcampbell.wordpress.com |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> a pop rock music vehicle for Soria's songs. The line up consisted of Soria on guitar and vocals, Stephan (Hams) Hamel on bass and Kravac on drums and background vocals. The project was short lived, but one commercial track was released, a cover of Donovan's \"Changes\" which was on Island of Circles, a tribute album to Donovan released on the [[Vancouver]], B.C.-based [[Nettwerk Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/island-of-circles-a-nettwork-compilation-r179308 |title=Island of Circles: A Nettwork Compilation \u2013 Donovan |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994 shortly after the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, a recording engineer position became available at [[Westbeach Recorders]]. Well known in the punk rock community, Westbeach was located in Hollywood and co-owned by [[Brett Gurewitz]] of [[Epitaph Records]] and his business partner, noted recording engineer [[Donnell Cameron]]. With a little prompting from Youth Brigade drummer Mark Stern, Donnell asked Kravac to forward him a demo reel of his work. Cameron was impressed enough with the contents of the demo to offer Kravac a position at Westbeach and three months later in March 1994 Kravac moved to Los Angeles to take the job.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevekravac.com/BIO.html |title=BIO |publisher=Stevekravac.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nKravac would remain at Westbeach for the next five years and during that time began recording some of the acts that he would eventually be best known for working with.

{"title_page": "Climate change in New Mexico", "text_new": "[[File:New Mexico K\u00f6ppen.png|thumb|right|K\u00f6ppen climate types in New Mexico.]]\n[[File:EPA CO-NM snowpack map w text.png|thumb|right|EPA map of changing snowpack levels in Colorado and New Mexico.]]\n'''Climate change in New Mexico''' encompasses the effects of [[climate change]], attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], in the U.S. state of [[New Mexico]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], \"New Mexico's climate is changing. Most of the state has warmed at least one degree (F) in the last century. Throughout the southwestern United States, heat waves are becoming more common, and snow is melting earlier in spring. In the coming decades, our changing climate is likely to decrease the flow of water in the Colorado, Rio Grande, and other rivers; threaten the health of livestock; increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires; and convert some rangelands to desert\".<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web|url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-nm.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for New Mexico|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Snowpack==\n\n\"As the climate warms, less precipitation falls as snow, and more snow melts during the winter. That decreases snowpack\u2014the amount of snow that accumulates over the winter. Since the 1950s, the snowpack has been decreasing in New Mexico, as well as in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, which matters because the headwaters of the Rio Grande, San Juan, Colorado, and Navajo rivers are in those states. Diminishing snowpack in northern New Mexico will shorten the season for skiing and other forms of winter tourism and recreation. The tree line may shift, as subalpine fir and other high-altitude trees become able to grow at higher elevations. A higher tree line would decrease the extent of alpine tundra ecosystems, which could threaten some species\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Water availability==\n\n\"The changing climate is likely to increase the need for water but reduce the supply. Warmer temperatures increase the rate at which water evaporates (or transpires) into the air from soils, plants, and surface waters. Irrigated farmland would thus need more water. But less water is likely to be available, because precipitation is unlikely to increase enough to make up for the additional water lost to evaporation. Annual rainfall is more likely to decrease than increase. So soils are likely to be drier, and periods without rain are likely to become longer, making droughts more severe. The decline in snowpack could further limit the supply of water for some purposes. Mountain snowpacks are natural reservoirs. They collect the snow that falls during winter and release water when the snow melts during spring and summer. Over the past 50 years, snowpack has been melting earlier in the year (see map on back page). Dams capture most meltwater and retain it for use later in the year. But upstream of these reservoirs, less water is available during droughts for ecosystems, fish, water-based recreation, and landowners who draw water directly from a flowing river\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\nIn 2019, the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] named New Mexico's [[Gila River]] as the nation's most endangered river, due to climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/gila-river-04-16-20189.php|title=New Mexico's Gila River Named America's Most Endangered River of 2019|publisher=[[Center for Biological Diversity]]|date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Agriculture==\n\n\"Increasing droughts and higher temperatures are likely to interfere with New Mexico\u2019s farms and cattle ranches. Hot weather can threaten cows\u2019 health and cause them to eat less, grow more slowly, and produce less milk. Livestock operations could also be impaired by fire and changes in the landscape from grassland to woody shrubs more typical of a desert. Reduced water availability would create challenges for ranchers, as well as farmers who irrigate fruits, vegetables, pecans, and other nut trees\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Wildfires and changing landscapes==\n\n\"Higher temperatures and drought are likely to increase the severity, frequency, and extent of wildfires, which could harm property, livelihoods, and human health. On average, more than 2 percent of the land in New Mexico has burned per decade since 1984. Wildfire smoke can reduce air quality and increase medical visits for chest pains, respiratory problems, and heart problems\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n\"The combination of more fires and drier conditions may expand deserts and otherwise change parts of New Mexico\u2019s landscape. Many plants and animals living in arid lands are already near the limits of what they can tolerate. A warmer and a drier climate would generally extend the Chihuahuan desert to higher elevations and expand its geographic range. In some cases, native vegetation may persist and delay or prevent expansion of the desert. In other cases, fires or livestock grazing may accelerate the conversion of grassland to desert in response to the changing climate. For similar reasons, some forests may change to desert or grassland\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Pests==\n\n\"Warmer, drier conditions make forests more susceptible to pests. Drought reduces the ability of trees to mount a defense against attacks from pests such as bark beetles, which have infested 200,000 acres in New Mexico.

Most of the state has warmed at least one degree (F) in the last century. Throughout the southwestern United States, heat waves are becoming more common, and snow is melting earlier in spring. In the coming decades, our changing climate is likely to decrease the flow of water in the Colorado, Rio Grande, and other rivers; threaten the health of livestock; increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires; and convert some rangelands to desert\".<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web|url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-nm.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for New Mexico|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Snowpack==\n\n\"As the climate warms, less precipitation falls as snow, and more snow melts during the winter. That decreases snowpack\u2014the amount of snow that accumulates over the winter. Since the 1950s, the snowpack has been decreasing in New Mexico, as well as in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, which matters because the headwaters of the Rio Grande, San Juan, Colorado, and Navajo rivers are in those states. Diminishing snowpack in northern New Mexico will shorten the season for skiing and other forms of winter tourism and recreation. The tree line may shift, as subalpine fir and other high-altitude trees become able to grow at higher elevations. A higher tree line would decrease the extent of alpine tundra ecosystems, which could threaten some species\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Water availability==\n\n\"The changing climate is likely to increase the need for water but reduce the supply. Warmer temperatures increase the rate at which water evaporates (or transpires) into the air from soils, plants, and surface waters. Irrigated farmland would thus need more water. But less water is likely to be available, because precipitation is unlikely to increase enough to make up for the additional water lost to evaporation. Annual rainfall is more likely to decrease than increase. So soils are likely to be drier, and periods without rain are likely to become longer, making droughts more severe. The decline in snowpack could further limit the supply of water for some purposes. Mountain snowpacks are natural reservoirs. They collect the snow that falls during winter and release water when the snow melts during spring and summer. Over the past 50 years, snowpack has been melting earlier in the year (see map on back page). Dams capture most meltwater and retain it for use later in the year. But upstream of these reservoirs, less water is available during droughts for ecosystems, fish, water-based recreation, and landowners who draw water directly from a flowing river\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\nIn 2019, the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] named New Mexico's [[Gila River]] as the nation's most endangered river, due to climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/gila-river-04-16-20189.php|title=New Mexico's Gila River Named America's Most Endangered River of 2019|publisher=[[Center for Biological Diversity]]|date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Agriculture==\n\n\"Increasing droughts and higher temperatures are likely to interfere with New Mexico\u2019s farms and cattle ranches. Hot weather can threaten cows\u2019 health and cause them to eat less, grow more slowly, and produce less milk. Livestock operations could also be impaired by fire and changes in the landscape from grassland to woody shrubs more typical of a desert. Reduced water availability would create challenges for ranchers, as well as farmers who irrigate fruits, vegetables, pecans, and other nut trees\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Wildfires and changing landscapes==\n\n\"Higher temperatures and drought are likely to increase the severity, frequency, and extent of wildfires, which could harm property, livelihoods, and human health. On average, more than 2 percent of the land in New Mexico has burned per decade since 1984. Wildfire smoke can reduce air quality and increase medical visits for chest pains, respiratory problems, and heart problems\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n\"The combination of more fires and drier conditions may expand deserts and otherwise change parts of New Mexico\u2019s landscape. Many plants and animals living in arid lands are already near the limits of what they can tolerate. A warmer and a drier climate would generally extend the Chihuahuan desert to higher elevations and expand its geographic range. In some cases, native vegetation may persist and delay or prevent expansion of the desert. In other cases, fires or livestock grazing may accelerate the conversion of grassland to desert in response to the changing climate. For similar reasons, some forests may change to desert or grassland\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Pests==\n\n\"Warmer, drier conditions make forests more susceptible to pests. Drought reduces the ability of trees to mount a defense against attacks from pests such as bark beetles, which have infested 200,000 acres in New Mexico. Temperature controls the life cycle and winter mortality rates of many pests. With higher winter temperatures, some pests can persist year-round, and new pests and diseases may become established\".<ref name=\"EPA\"/>\n\n==Extreme heat==\n\n\"Hot days can be unhealthy\u2014even dangerous.
