After an accident, Keith is forced to see the world in a new way when his wife, his friends, and especially his agent don't make life easy for the incapacitated. What results is a series of visits with the floura and fauna of the Hollywood comedy world, with most of the actors playing parodies of themselves. The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout. Powell has described the show as contemplative with \"earned\" jokes.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/behind-the-video-keith-powell-on-truth-race-and-ea|title=Behind the video: Keith Powell on truth, race & earned jokes|work=Vimeo}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Keith Powell]] as Keith\u2014the eponymous character.

Most guest actors who appear in the show play a parody version of themselves, including [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Fiona Gubelmann]], [[Malcolm Barrett (actor)|Malcolm Barrett]], [[Leonard Robinson]], and [[Alexandra Krosney]].  Powell writes, directs, and produces all episodes in addition to starring.\n\nUpon its release, the show received much publicity due to Powell blogging for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', which highlighted each episode of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-powell/|title=Keith Powell|publisher=}}</ref>  The blogs discussed race, politics, relationships, friendship, marriage, and other current events as it relates to specific moments in the web series.

After an accident, Keith is forced to see the world in a new way when his wife, his friends, and especially his agent don't make life easy for the incapacitated. What results is a series of visits with the floura and fauna of the Hollywood comedy world, with most of the actors playing parodies of themselves. The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout. Powell has described the show as contemplative with \"earned\" jokes.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/behind-the-video-keith-powell-on-truth-race-and-ea|title=Behind the video: Keith Powell on truth, race & earned jokes|work=Vimeo}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Keith Powell]] as Keith\u2014the eponymous character.

The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's second-latest start on record (behind only the [[1986\u201387 Australian region cyclone season|1986\u201387 season]]), with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020. As of 11 April, a total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since 2016\u201317. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]].

Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans between [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]] and [[160th meridian east|160\u00b0E]]. The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's second-latest start on record (behind only the [[1986\u201387 Australian region cyclone season|1986\u201387 season]]), with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020. As of 11 April, a total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since 2016\u201317. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

However, as the number of genes reduces the likelihood of choosing a correct candidate gene, [[Type I and type II errors|Type I errors (false positives)]] are highly likely.  Candidate genes studies frequently possess a number of flaws, including frequent genotyping errors and being statistically underpowered.  These effects are compounded by the usual assessment of genes without regard for gene-gene interactions.

The observation of this efficacy led to the ''monoamine hypothesis of depression'', which postulates that the deficit of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for depression, and even that certain neurotransmitters are linked to specific symptoms. Normal serotonin levels have been linked to mood and behaviour regulation, sleep, and digestion; norepinephrine to the [[fight-or-flight response]]; and dopamine to movement, pleasure, and motivation. Some have also proposed the relationship between monoamines and phenotypes such as serotonin in sleep and suicide, norepinephrine in dysphoria, fatigue, apathy, cognitive dysfunction, and dopamine in loss of motivation and psychomotor symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marchand|last2=Valentina|last3=Jensen|title=Neurobiology of Mood disorders|journal=Hospital Physician|pages=17\u201326}}</ref> The main limitation for the monoamine hypothesis of depression is the therapeutic lag between initiation of antidepressant treatment and perceived improvement of symptoms. One explanation for this therapeutic lag is that the initial increase in synaptic serotonin is only temporary, as firing of serotonergic neurons in the [[dorsal raphe]] adapt via the activity of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> [[autoreceptor]]s.  The therapeutic effect of antidepressants is thought to arise from autoreceptor desensitization over a period of time, eventually elevating firing of serotonergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hjorth|first1=S|last2=Bengtsson|first2=HJ|last3=Kullberg|first3=A|last4=Carlzon|first4=D|last5=Peilot|first5=H|last6=Auerbach|first6=SB|title=Serotonin autoreceptor function and antidepressant drug action|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=June 2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=177\u201385|doi=10.1177/026988110001400208|pmid=10890313}}</ref>\n[[File:Monoamine receptor effects.png|thumb|Monoamine receptors affect [[phospholipase C]] and [[adenylyl cyclase]] inside of the cell.

The model attempts to relate specific symptoms of depression to neurological abnormalities.  Elevated resting amygdala activity was proposed to underlie rumination, as stimulation of the amygdala has been reported to be associated with the intrusive recall of negative memories. The ACC was divided into [[Brodmann area 24|pregenual (pgACC)]] and [[Brodmann area 24|subgenual regions (sgACC)]], with the former being electrophysiologically associated with fear, and the latter being metabolically implicated in sadness in healthy subjects.  Hyperactivity of the lateral orbitofrontal and insular regions, along with abnormalities in lateral prefrontal regions was suggested to underlie maladaptive emotional responses, given the regions roles in reward learning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drevets|first1=WC|title=Neuroimaging and neuropathological studies of depression: implications for the cognitive-emotional features of mood disorders.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=April 2001|volume=11|issue=2|pages=240\u20139|pmid=11301246|doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(00)00203-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mayberg|first1=Helen|title=Limbic-cortical dysregulation: a proposed model of depression|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=1 August 1997|volume=9|issue=3|pages=471\u2013481|doi=10.1176/jnp.9.3.471|issn=0895-0172|pmid=9276848}}</ref>  This model and another termed \"the cortical striatal model\", which focused more on abnormalities in the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]], have been supported by recent literature.

However, amygdala activity was reported to be decreased, contrary to the limbic-cortical model.

Several areas of the brain are implicated in studies seeking to more fully understand the biology of depression:\n\n==== Subgenual cingulate ====\nStudies have shown that [[Subgenual cingulate|Brodmann area 25]], also known as subgenual cingulate, is metabolically overactive in [[treatment-resistant depression]].  This region is extremely rich in [[serotonin transporter]]s and is considered as a governor for a vast network involving areas like [[hypothalamus]] and [[brain stem]], which influences changes in appetite and sleep; the [[amygdala]] and [[Insular cortex|insula]], which affect the mood and anxiety; the [[hippocampus]], which plays an important role in memory formation; and some parts of the [[frontal cortex]] responsible for self-esteem.

The observation of this efficacy led to the ''monoamine hypothesis of depression'', which postulates that the deficit of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for depression, and even that certain neurotransmitters are linked to specific symptoms. Normal serotonin levels have been linked to mood and behaviour regulation, sleep, and digestion; norepinephrine to the [[fight-or-flight response]]; and dopamine to movement, pleasure, and motivation. Some have also proposed the relationship between monoamines and phenotypes such as serotonin in sleep and suicide, norepinephrine in dysphoria, fatigue, apathy, cognitive dysfunction, and dopamine in loss of motivation and psychomotor symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marchand|last2=Valentina|last3=Jensen|title=Neurobiology of Mood disorders|journal=Hospital Physician|pages=17\u201326}}</ref> The main limitation for the monoamine hypothesis of depression is the therapeutic lag between initiation of antidepressant treatment and perceived improvement of symptoms. One explanation for this therapeutic lag is that the initial increase in synaptic serotonin is only temporary, as firing of serotonergic neurons in the [[dorsal raphe]] adapt via the activity of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> [[autoreceptor]]s.  The therapeutic effect of antidepressants is thought to arise from autoreceptor desensitization over a period of time, eventually elevating firing of serotonergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hjorth|first1=S|last2=Bengtsson|first2=HJ|last3=Kullberg|first3=A|last4=Carlzon|first4=D|last5=Peilot|first5=H|last6=Auerbach|first6=SB|title=Serotonin autoreceptor function and antidepressant drug action|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=June 2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=177\u201385|doi=10.1177/026988110001400208|pmid=10890313}}</ref>\n[[File:Monoamine receptor effects.png|thumb|Monoamine receptors affect [[phospholipase C]] and [[adenylyl cyclase]] inside of the cell.

Optogenetic excitation of D1-MSNs alleviates depressive symptoms and is rewarding, while the same with D2-MSNs enhances depressive symptoms.  Excitation of glutaminergic inputs from the ventral hippocampus reduces social interactions, and enhancing these projections produces susceptibility to stress-induced depression.<ref name=\"Knowland\"/>  Manipulations of different regions of the mPFC can produce and attenuate depressive behaviors.  For example, inhibiting mPFC neurons specifically in the intralimbic cortex attenuates depressive behaviors.  The conflicting findings associated with mPFC stimulation, when compared to the relatively specific findings in the infralimbic cortex, suggest that the prelimbic cortex and infralimbic cortex may mediate opposing effects.<ref name=\"Lammel\"/>  mPFC projections to the raphe nuclei are largely GABAergic and inhibit the firing of serotonergic neurons.

To support the [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship) to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southhampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned.

In this field he is best known as an author and broadcaster although he is also a magazine editor, lecturer and after dinner speaker as well as being an adviser to various outdoor organisations.\n\n==Early days==\nMcNeish was brought up in the [[Glasgow]] area in [[Scotland]] and did much of his early walking as a youth in the [[Campsie Fells]]. As his confidence grew, he moved further afield to bigger mountains and his first [[Munro]] was [[Ben Lomond]]. For a number of years McNeish worked for the [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]] as a warden and for a period ran the busy hostel at [[Aviemore]], in his early years he also worked as a ski and climbing instructor. 1978 saw the publication of his first book, \"Highland Ways\" which was about backpacking in Scotland. In 1982 he started a weekly outdoor column in his local newspaper the ''Strathspey and Badenoch Herald'' called \"McNeish at Large\" and in the same year co-founded the outdoor magazine ''[[Footloose (magazine)|Footloose]]'' with two colleagues.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 1985, he became editor of ''Climber and Rambler'' magazine, leaving in 1991 to become editor of [[TGO Magazine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/ |title=The Great Outdoors magazine &#124; The UK's leading monthly hillwalking magazine |publisher=Tgomagazine.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> (formerly The Great Outdoors).

Throughout the late 1980s, McNeish contributed and wrote regularly for outdoor programmes on [[BBC Radio Scotland]], in 1991 he scripted and hosted ''The Munro Challenge'' for [[BBC Radio 4]] to celebrate 100 years of the Munro Tables. During this time Cameron was still writing books and the immensely popular ''The Munros Almanac'' and ''The Munros: Scotland\u2019s Highest Mountains'' were released in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1994, McNeish moved into television, presenting the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]]-winning ''The Edge: One Hundred Years of Scottish Mountaineering'' and in the same year ''The Great Outdoors'', a six-part series for [[Channel 4]]. His best known television work is the ''Wilderness Walks'' programmes that he made for [[BBC Two]]: the first series was broadcast in 1997 and the second in 1998. McNeish was a consultant and guest on the 2007 series ''[[Mountain (TV series)|Mountain]]''. In the first programme he guides series presenter [[Griff Rhys Jones]] to the summit of Scotland's most northerly Munro, [[Ben Hope]], in a snowstorm. He is also a regular contributor to the [[BBC Scotland]] series, ''[[The Adventure Show]]''. After a break of a number of years from book writing, McNeish released ''\"The Sutherland Trail: A Journey Through Scotland's North-west\"'' in August 2009 in conjunction with award-winning photographer and film maker Richard Else. The book is a description of a week-long walking route through [[Sutherland]], in the far north-west of Scotland. That book was followed by others co-authored with Richard Else - The Skye Trail and Scotland End to End. In 2018 Cameron produced an autobiography, There's Always the Hills, published by Sandstone Press. That book became the Great Outdoor Magazine Book of the Year.\n\n==Travels==\nCameron McNeish has travelled in many of the remote places in the world having hiked, backpacked, skied and climbed in the Alps, the Pyrenees, Spain, Iceland, North America, Norway, Sweden, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Central America, Slovenia, Russia, Guatemala, Corsica, Jordan and Turkey. Despite this most of his walking is done in the [[Scottish Highlands]] collecting data for his newspaper columns and creating podcasts for his personal website [<ref>[http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/biography/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225192031/http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/biography/ |date=25 December 2007 }}</ref>].

In this field he is best known as an author and broadcaster although he is also a magazine editor, lecturer and after dinner speaker as well as being an adviser to various outdoor organisations.\n\n==Early days==\nMcNeish was brought up in the [[Glasgow]] area in [[Scotland]] and did much of his early walking as a youth in the [[Campsie Fells]]. As his confidence grew, he moved further afield to bigger mountains and his first [[Munro]] was [[Ben Lomond]]. For a number of years McNeish worked for the [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]] as a warden and for a period ran the busy hostel at [[Aviemore]], in his early years he also worked as a ski and climbing instructor. 1978 saw the publication of his first book, \"Highland Ways\" which was about backpacking in Scotland. In 1982 he started a weekly outdoor column in his local newspaper the ''Strathspey and Badenoch Herald'' called \"McNeish at Large\" and in the same year co-founded the outdoor magazine ''[[Footloose (magazine)|Footloose]]'' with two colleagues.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 1985, he became editor of ''Climber and Rambler'' magazine, leaving in 1991 to become editor of [[TGO Magazine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/ |title=The Great Outdoors magazine &#124; The UK's leading monthly hillwalking magazine |publisher=Tgomagazine.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> (formerly The Great Outdoors).  Since 2010, he has been editor-at-large of TGO Magazine giving him more time to work on other projects.<ref>[http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/tgo/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501082739/http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/tgo/ |date=1 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1999 he became outdoor correspondent of the [[Sunday Herald]] writing the weekly ''Peak Practice'' column. Throughout the late 1980s, McNeish contributed and wrote regularly for outdoor programmes on [[BBC Radio Scotland]], in 1991 he scripted and hosted ''The Munro Challenge'' for [[BBC Radio 4]] to celebrate 100 years of the Munro Tables. During this time Cameron was still writing books and the immensely popular ''The Munros Almanac'' and ''The Munros: Scotland\u2019s Highest Mountains'' were released in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1994, McNeish moved into television, presenting the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]]-winning ''The Edge: One Hundred Years of Scottish Mountaineering'' and in the same year ''The Great Outdoors'', a six-part series for [[Channel 4]]. His best known television work is the ''Wilderness Walks'' programmes that he made for [[BBC Two]]: the first series was broadcast in 1997 and the second in 1998. McNeish was a consultant and guest on the 2007 series ''[[Mountain (TV series)|Mountain]]''. In the first programme he guides series presenter [[Griff Rhys Jones]] to the summit of Scotland's most northerly Munro, [[Ben Hope]], in a snowstorm. He is also a regular contributor to the [[BBC Scotland]] series, ''[[The Adventure Show]]''. After a break of a number of years from book writing, McNeish released ''\"The Sutherland Trail: A Journey Through Scotland's North-west\"'' in August 2009 in conjunction with award-winning photographer and film maker Richard Else. The book is a description of a week-long walking route through [[Sutherland]], in the far north-west of Scotland. That book was followed by others co-authored with Richard Else - The Skye Trail and Scotland End to End. In 2018 Cameron produced an autobiography, There's Always the Hills, published by Sandstone Press. That book became the Great Outdoor Magazine Book of the Year.\n\n==Travels==\nCameron McNeish has travelled in many of the remote places in the world having hiked, backpacked, skied and climbed in the Alps, the Pyrenees, Spain, Iceland, North America, Norway, Sweden, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Central America, Slovenia, Russia, Guatemala, Corsica, Jordan and Turkey. Despite this most of his walking is done in the [[Scottish Highlands]] collecting data for his newspaper columns and creating podcasts for his personal website [<ref>[http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/biography/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225192031/http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/biography/ |date=25 December 2007 }}</ref>].

Some [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battles were fought near the village. Los Lunas became the county seat in 1876 and became an incorporated village in 1928.

With around 10,000 inhabitants, it is the biggest borough of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe ''Str\u00fcmpfelbach'' divides Bettringen into an upper part (''Oberbettringen'') and a lower part (''Unterbettringen''). Oberbettringen lies mainly on the North side of the river, while Unterbettringen is placed on the South side. The ''Str\u00fcmpfelbach'' flows into the [[Rems (river)|Rems]]. Adjacent boroughs of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd are Weiler in den Bergen, Hussenhofen, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd proper and Bargau. Bettringen also borders on the municipality [[Waldstetten]].\n\nBettringen lies 50&nbsp;km east of Stuttgart and on the foot of the [[Swabian Alps]].\n\n== History ==\n\nBettringen was first mentioned in 1218 in the ''red book of the cloister Lorch''. In the 15th century there was the first mention of Oberbettringen and Unterbettringen.\n\nThe ''Bettringen Lords'' (''Herren von Bettringen'') are mentioned in a few certifications in the 13th and 14th century.\n\nSince 1870 ''Unterbettringen'' was part of Oberbettringen. In 1934 the municipality was renamed to Bettringen.\n\nIn 1934 the city council of Oberbettringen decided to change its name into '''Bettringen'''.\n\nSince April 1, 1959 Bettringen is part of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe ''[[Mayor|Ortsvorsteherin]]'' (representative) of Bettringen is Brigitte Wei\u00df ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]). The local council has 16 seats: 8 CDU, 4 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], 3 [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], 1 [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Four members of the local council are also member of the city council of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]].\n\nAlso some of the members of the city youth council are from Bettringen or the schools of Bettringen (including the School of Education).\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:St Cyriakus Kirche.jpg|thumb|St. Cyriakus]]\nFor a long time Bettringen was mainly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Since the migrations after World War II also Protestant people came to Bettringen. Today over 5000 catholic people live in Bettringen in the St. Cyriakus parish. There are three Catholic churches and a chapel:\n\n* ''[[Cyriacus|St. Cyriakus church]]'', main church\n* ''St. Ottilia church'', oldest church\n* ''Auferstehung-Christi-Church'' (Resurrection of Christ church)\n* ''Felix chapel''\n\nCatholic services are held at least once a day from Tuesday to Sunday.

With around 10,000 inhabitants, it is the biggest borough of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe ''Str\u00fcmpfelbach'' divides Bettringen into an upper part (''Oberbettringen'') and a lower part (''Unterbettringen''). Oberbettringen lies mainly on the North side of the river, while Unterbettringen is placed on the South side. The ''Str\u00fcmpfelbach'' flows into the [[Rems (river)|Rems]]. Adjacent boroughs of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd are Weiler in den Bergen, Hussenhofen, Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd proper and Bargau. Bettringen also borders on the municipality [[Waldstetten]].\n\nBettringen lies 50&nbsp;km east of Stuttgart and on the foot of the [[Swabian Alps]].\n\n== History ==\n\nBettringen was first mentioned in 1218 in the ''red book of the cloister Lorch''. In the 15th century there was the first mention of Oberbettringen and Unterbettringen.\n\nThe ''Bettringen Lords'' (''Herren von Bettringen'') are mentioned in a few certifications in the 13th and 14th century.\n\nSince 1870 ''Unterbettringen'' was part of Oberbettringen. In 1934 the municipality was renamed to Bettringen.\n\nIn 1934 the city council of Oberbettringen decided to change its name into '''Bettringen'''.\n\nSince April 1, 1959 Bettringen is part of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe ''[[Mayor|Ortsvorsteherin]]'' (representative) of Bettringen is Brigitte Wei\u00df ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]). The local council has 16 seats: 8 CDU, 4 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], 3 [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], 1 [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Four members of the local council are also member of the city council of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]].\n\nAlso some of the members of the city youth council are from Bettringen or the schools of Bettringen (including the School of Education).\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:St Cyriakus Kirche.jpg|thumb|St. Cyriakus]]\nFor a long time Bettringen was mainly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Since the migrations after World War II also Protestant people came to Bettringen. Today over 5000 catholic people live in Bettringen in the St. Cyriakus parish. There are three Catholic churches and a chapel:\n\n* ''[[Cyriacus|St. Cyriakus church]]'', main church\n* ''St. Ottilia church'', oldest church\n* ''Auferstehung-Christi-Church'' (Resurrection of Christ church)\n* ''Felix chapel''\n\nCatholic services are held at least once a day from Tuesday to Sunday. All catholic churches have their own pipe organ. A highlight of the ecumene is the annual ecumene service, which is every Pentecost in one of the both parishes.\n\n=== The Organ of the St. Cyriakus church ===\n\n'''The pipes, stops and rows:'''\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Hauptwerk''' C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Helltrompete || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Mixtur V-VI|| 2\u2032\n|-\n|Octave || 4\u2032\n|-\n|Principal || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Pommer || 16'\n|-\n|Rohrfl\u00f6te || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Gemshorn|| 4\u2032\n|-\n|Nasatquinte || 2<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>\u2032\n|-\n|Blockfl\u00f6te || 2\u2019\n|-\n|Tremulant || \n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Schwellwerk''' C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Dulcian|| 16\u2032\n|-\n|Scharffzimbel IV|| <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>\u2032\n|-\n|Italienisch Principal || 4\u2032\n|-\n|Rohrfl\u00f6te || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Quintade || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Schwegel || 2\u2032\n|-\n|Terz || 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>\u2032\n|-\n|Siffl\u00f6te || 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>\u2032\n|-\n|Tremulant \n|-\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III R\u00fcckpositiv''' C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Largiot || 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>\u2032 + 1'\n|-\n|Kleingedackt || 4\u2032\n|-\n|Gedackt || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Principal || 4\u2032\n|-\n|Oktave || 2\u2032\n|-\n|Scharff III || 1\u2032\n|-\n|Oboe || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Tremulant || \n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013f<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Tromba || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Posaune|| 16\u2032\n|-\n|Hintersatz IV || <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>\u2032\n|-\n|Choralbass || 4\u2032 + 2'\n|-\n|Oktavbass || 8\u2032\n|-\n|Subbass || 16\u2032\n|-\n|Zartbass || 16\u2032\n|-\n|Spitzgambe || 8\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBettringen has a rich cultural life, with many clubs.
