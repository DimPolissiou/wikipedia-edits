In the song, the parents of the fictional ''[[South Park]]'', led by [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila Broflovski]] ([[Mary Kay Bergman]]), decided to blame Canada for the trouble their children have been getting into since watching the Canadian-made movie ''[[Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire]]'' and imitating what they saw and heard in the movie. \"Blame Canada\" satirizes [[scapegoating]] and parents that do not control \"their children's consumption of [[popular culture]]\". The song also appears as an 8-bit remix in the 2014 game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', in which it appears as one of the overworld themes for the Canada level.<ref name=\"Weinstock2008\">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock|title=Taking South Park Seriously|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7OEFij0QkgC&pg=PA61|date=11 September 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7566-9|pages=61\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe song was [[72nd Academy Awards|nominated]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (1999).  This created controversy because all nominated songs are traditionally performed during the Oscar broadcast, but the song contained the word ''[[fuck]]'', which the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] prohibits using in prime time broadcasts. At the [[72nd Academy Awards]], comedian [[Robin Williams]] performed the song with a [[choir|chorus]] that gasped when the word was to be sung (Williams turned around at the crucial moment and did not actually sing it). He included digs at [[Margaret Trudeau]] and [[Bryan Adams]], partially taken from lyrics of [[Sheila Broflovski]]'s reprise of the song in \"[[La Resistance (South Park song)|La Resistance]]\". He referenced [[Celine Dion]] as well. [[Mary Kay Bergman]], the voice actress who sang the female parts in the song, committed [[suicide]] months before the performance, forcing the organizers to search for a replacement for her and [[Trey Parker]], who did the male voices. Williams introduced the song by speaking with [[duct tape]] over his mouth so that his speech resembled that of [[Kenny McCormick]], then tearing it off and finally saying [[Stan Marsh]]'s trademark line, \"[[Kenny's deaths|Oh my god! They killed Kenny!]]\"\n\nThere was also some concern about the fact the song referred to well-known Canadian singer [[Anne Murray]] as a \"bitch\", but Murray indicated that she was not offended by the tongue-in-cheek lyric (Murray was invited to sing the song herself on the Oscar telecast but had to decline due to a prior commitment). When asked, the Canadian [[Consul General]] (and former [[Prime Minister]]) [[Kim Campbell]] said that she was not offended by the song since it was clearly a silly satirical piece and not intended to insult her country. This is made clear in the final line of the song:\n<blockquote>We must blame them and cause a fuss.<br />Before somebody thinks of blaming us!</blockquote>\n\nCoincidentally, the Canadian Oscar telecast in which Robin Williams sang the song included the premiere of the \"[[I Am Canadian]]\" rant advertisement, which counters many perceived Canadian stereotypes.\n\nThe Oscar was instead awarded to [[Phil Collins]]' song \"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\" from [[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]], which was parodied on an episode of ''South Park'' released the following year, \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", as \"You'll Be in Me\". In the episode, Collins acts as the episode's antagonist, and is always seen holding an Oscar statuette.

In the song, the parents of the fictional ''[[South Park]]'', led by [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila Broflovski]] ([[Mary Kay Bergman]]), decided to blame Canada for the trouble their children have been getting into since watching the Canadian-made movie ''[[Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire]]'' and imitating what they saw and heard in the movie. \"Blame Canada\" satirizes [[scapegoating]] and parents that do not control \"their children's consumption of [[popular culture]]\". The song also appears as an 8-bit remix in the 2014 game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', in which it appears as one of the overworld themes for the Canada level.<ref name=\"Weinstock2008\">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock|title=Taking South Park Seriously|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7OEFij0QkgC&pg=PA61|date=11 September 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7566-9|pages=61\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe song was [[72nd Academy Awards|nominated]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (1999).  This created controversy because all nominated songs are traditionally performed during the Oscar broadcast, but the song contained the word ''[[fuck]]'', which the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] prohibits using in prime time broadcasts. At the [[72nd Academy Awards]], comedian [[Robin Williams]] performed the song with a [[choir|chorus]] that gasped when the word was to be sung (Williams turned around at the crucial moment and did not actually sing it). He included digs at [[Margaret Trudeau]] and [[Bryan Adams]], partially taken from lyrics of [[Sheila Broflovski]]'s reprise of the song in \"[[La Resistance (South Park song)|La Resistance]]\". He referenced [[Celine Dion]] as well. [[Mary Kay Bergman]], the voice actress who sang the female parts in the song, committed [[suicide]] months before the performance, forcing the organizers to search for a replacement for her and [[Trey Parker]], who did the male voices. Williams introduced the song by speaking with [[duct tape]] over his mouth so that his speech resembled that of [[Kenny McCormick]], then tearing it off and finally saying [[Stan Marsh]]'s trademark line, \"[[Kenny's deaths|Oh my god! They killed Kenny!]]\"\n\nThere was also some concern about the fact the song referred to well-known Canadian singer [[Anne Murray]] as a \"bitch\", but Murray indicated that she was not offended by the tongue-in-cheek lyric (Murray was invited to sing the song herself on the Oscar telecast but had to decline due to a prior commitment). When asked, the Canadian [[Consul General]] (and former [[Prime Minister]]) [[Kim Campbell]] said that she was not offended by the song since it was clearly a silly satirical piece and not intended to insult her country. This is made clear in the final line of the song:\n<blockquote>We must blame them and cause a fuss.<br />Before somebody thinks of blaming us!</blockquote>\n\nCoincidentally, the Canadian Oscar telecast in which Robin Williams sang the song included the premiere of the \"[[I Am Canadian]]\" rant advertisement, which counters many perceived Canadian stereotypes.\n\nThe Oscar was instead awarded to [[Phil Collins]]' song \"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\" from [[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]], which was parodied on an episode of ''South Park'' released the following year, \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", as \"You'll Be in Me\".
