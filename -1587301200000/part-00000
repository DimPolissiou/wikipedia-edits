He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.</ref>\n\n==Easter tables==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of [[Easter]] (AD 532-626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation ([[computus]]).<ref>Declercq (2000) 99</ref> This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W. Burke-Gaffney.</ref> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] noted that Christ was born during the reign of King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Matthew 2:1|2:1]]\u2013[[Matthew 2:18|18]]), whose death he placed in 4&nbsp;BC. Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter.

He was a member of a community of [[Scythian monks]] concentrated in [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] (present day Constanta), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the (Christianised) [[Julian calendar]]. Almost all churches adopted his [[computus]] (calculation) for the dates of [[Easter]].\n\nFrom about 500, he lived in [[Rome]], where, as a learned member of the [[Roman Curia]], he translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the [[Canons of the Apostles|apostolical canons]]; the decrees of the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and Sardis; and a collection of the [[decretal]]s of the popes from [[Pope Siricius|Siricius]] to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. These ''[[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae]]'' had great authority in the West, and continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.\n\nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's ''Computus'', writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] accorded him the honorific ''abbas'', which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend [[Cassiodorus]] stated in ''Institutiones'' that he was still a monk late in life.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, [[Cassiodorus]], Dionysius although by birth a \"[[Scythian]]\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).<ref>''Dionysius Monachus, Scytha natione, sed moribus omnino Romanus, in utraque lingua valde doctissimus''. {{cite book|title=De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum|author=Cassiodorus|language=Latin|chapter-url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/02m/0485-0585,_Cassiodorus_Vivariensis_Abbas,_De_Institutione_Divinarum_Litterarum,_MLT.pdf|chapter=Chapter XXIII}} At the ''[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/ Documenta Catholica Omnia]'' online library.</ref> He was also a thorough Catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05010b.htm Dionysius Exiguus in the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</ref> The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, [[Scythia Minor]].<ref name=Amory>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489\u2013554'', Cambridge University Press, 2003.</ref>{{rp|127}} By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}} Even for the \"Scythian monk\" [[Joannes Maxentius]], friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just like [[Faustus of Riez]] is a \"[[Gallia|Gaul]]\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|127}}\n\nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of [[Goths|Gothic]] extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the [[Scythian monks]], Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|128}} In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"[[Bessi]]an\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130}} Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised [[Thracians|Thracian]] stock, born in Scythia Minor or in [[Moesia]]; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|129}} By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local [[Thraco-Roman]] origin, like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era ([[Justin I]], [[Justinian]], [[Flavius Aetius]], etc.).<ref name=Amory/>{{rp|130\u2013131}}\n\n==Works and translations==\nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist. The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.\n\nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His [[Collectiones canonum Dionysianae|several collections]] embrace:\n\n:1. A collection of synodal decrees, of which he has left two editions:\n::a. ''Codex canonum Ecclesi\u00e6 Univers\u00e6''. This contains canons of Oriental synods and councils only in Greek and Latin, including those of the four \u0153cumenical councils from Nic\u00e6a (325) to Chalcedon (451).\n::b. ''Codex canonum ecclesiasticarum''. This is in Latin only; its contents agree generally with the other, but the Council of Ephesus (431) is omitted, while the so-called \"Canons of the Apostles\" and those of Sardica are included, as well as 138 canons of the African Council of Carthage (419).\n::c. Another bilingual version of Greek canons, undertaken at the instance of [[Pope Hormisdas]], only the preface has been preserved.\n\n:2. A collection of papal Constitutions (''Collectio decretorum Pontificum Romanorum'') from Siricius to Anastasius II (384\u2013498).\n\n==Anno Domini==\nDionysius is best known as the inventor of the [[Anno Domini]] era, which is used to number the years of both the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]]. He used it to identify the several Easters in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]], but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian years]] that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable [[Bede]] to date the events in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731.\n\nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the [[Second Coming]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek [[Septuagint]].  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000.</ref>\n\n==Easter tables==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of [[Easter]] (AD 532-626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation ([[computus]]).<ref>Declercq (2000) 99</ref> This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 1999, 793\u2013794.</ref> Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before [[Bede]]. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' also include a letter from Bishop [[Proterius of Alexandria]] to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]] (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his ''Liber de Paschate'' (''Book on Easter'') by Audette.  \n\nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by [[Victorius of Aquitaine]], complaining that it did not obey [[Alexandria]]n principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian Era]], whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle {{nowrap|(1&ndash;19).}}\n\nUltimately, [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]], meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 152.</ref> must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,<ref>G Declercq, ''Anno Domini: The Origins of the Christian Era'', Turnhout (2000), p 153.</ref> where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,<ref>L Holford-Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), p 50.</ref> [[Victorius of Aquitaine]]\u2019s lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.\n\nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The [[epact]] thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in their calendar, simple arithmetic because all their months had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.<ref>L Holford - Strevens, ''The History of Time: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford (2005), pp 49\u201351.</ref>\n   \nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table thanks its strong structure to his distant predecessor [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], who invented the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle, which is an application of the [[Metonic cycle]] in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Declercq (2000) 65-66</ref> Its lunar cycle is the Metonic 19-yera lunar cycle proposed by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] and adopted by bishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]] in the first half of the fifth century.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> The Metonic structure of this so called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of [[Epact|epacts]].<ref>Zuidhoek (2017) 87</ref>\n\nThe [[Epact|epact]], since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word ''nulla'' meaning ''no/none'' was used because no [[Roman numeral]] for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word ''nvlla'',<ref>Declercq (2000) 102</ref> also meaning ''nothing''. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Easter cycle]] all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in [[India]].\n\nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered ''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' (''Years of our Lord [[Jesus]] Christ'') because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did ''not'' realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years,<ref>Declercq (2000) 140</ref> otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact{{cn|date=January 2019}}.\n\nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the ''insular latercus'') should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of [[Bede]]'s ''The Reckoning of Time'' was published (by AD 771),<ref>Declercq (2000) 163</ref> the Church of the Franks ([[France]]) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of [[Alcuin]], after he arrived from Britain.\n\nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|lk=no|190}}) and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] ({{circa|lk=no|320}}) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD&nbsp;1 and 1&nbsp;BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1&nbsp;BC (historians do not use a [[year zero]]), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1&nbsp;BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1&nbsp;BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in AD&nbsp;1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2&nbsp;BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]] was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,<ref>Marking Time, by Duncan Steel.</ref> deriving this from the chronology of [[Herod the Great]], his son [[Philip the Tetrarch]], and the daughter of [[Augustus]], [[Julia the Elder|Julia]].<ref>Worlds Made by Words: Scholarship and Community in the Modern West, by Anthony Grafton.</ref> Having read Suslyga's work,<ref>Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem by W.

Kepler chose this year because [[Josephus]] stated that a [[lunar eclipse]] occurred shortly before Herod's death.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&pageno=558 Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, Paragraph 4.]</ref> John Pratt of the [[International Planetarium Society]] proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.<ref name=\"j\">John P.

Both 37&nbsp;BC minus 34 and 40&nbsp;BC minus 37 yield 4 or 3&nbsp;BC. See [[List of Republican Roman Consuls]] for the modern year numbers.</ref>\n\nAlthough Dionysius stated that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council was working with Canon 1 of the Council of Arles (AD 314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated ''uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem'' (on one day and at one time through all the world) and had charged the bishop of Rome with fixing the date. A circular letter from the Emperor Constantine to bishops who did not attend records:\n\n<blockquote>It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.</blockquote>\n\nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria confirms:\n\n<blockquote>All our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.</blockquote>                  \n\nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the [[Alexandrian calendar]].<ref name=Neugebauer>{{citation |last=Neugebauer |first=Otto |author-link=Otto Neugebauer |title=Ethiopic Astronomy and Computus |year=2016 |origyear=1979 |edition=2nd |publisher=Red Sea Press |pages=93, 95\u2013100 |isbn=978-1-56902-440-9}}, The pages of this 2nd edition have numbers that are six less than the same pages in the 1st (Austrian) edition.</ref> Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the [[Julian calendar]]. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the ''XII Kalendas Aprilis'' (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], was the date that [[Korban Pesach|paschal lambs]] were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|23:5}}). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the [[Gospel of John]] (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|26:17}}, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], his [[Last Supper]]. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ab urbe condita]]\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, \"Calendars and chronology\", ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 1999), 659\u2013937.\n* Bonnie Blackburn, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford, 2003, a corrected reprinting of the 1999 original edition).\n* Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (The Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout ({{ISBN|9782503510507}})\n* Declercq, G.

It was an offshoot of the ''Catholic Social Folk Movement'' (KSzN), a civil organization. At the beginning of 1945 they elected Barankovics as principal secretary.\n\nThe new KDNP enjoyed just four or five months of semi-legality towards the end of World War II. At the end of the war, the communist-dominated post-war authorities refused to legalize it or permit it to operate further. Despite attempts by Varga and Barankovics, they were refused official permission to operate and take part in elections. Some of the party's founders, including Varga, were imprisoned for some days by detachments of the [[Arrow Cross Party]].\n\nMeanwhile, some party members were saying that Barankovics conceded too much to the communist-influenced authorities in return for too little, and there was growing friction between two factions: the Christian socialist left wing led by Barankovics and the conservative-clerical right wing led by [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]'s confidant, J\u00f3zsef P\u00e1lffy. The left wing gained increasing ascendancy in the party, and on 8 May 1945, Barankovics replaced P\u00e1lffy as president. The party changed its name to the '''Democratic People's Party''' (DNP), while a group led by P\u00e1lffy founded a new party called KDNP, which, however, failed to remain legal in an atmosphere of increasing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence. The [[1947 Hungarian parliamentary election|1947 elections]] saw the DNP finish second in the popular vote, winning 60 of the 411 seats.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & St\u00f6ver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p931 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref>\n\nDNP was a democratic and anticommunist organisation. In 1949, [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] asked Barankovics for the party's leaders to help him in the [[show trial]] against Cardinal Mindszenty, who was already ill in prison. Barankovics refused and, abandoning his party, escaped to Austria in an American diplomat's car. Many people followed his example; others were imprisoned by communists. The party was subsequently dissolved in January 1949.<ref>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, p911</ref>\n\n== Refoundation and present ==\n\nThe party was refounded in 1989 with its present name. The link between the historical party and the present one is disputed, although prominent members of the original party, like [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Varga (politician, 1936)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Varga]], took part in its refoundation. It was part of the [[Hungarian National Assembly]] between 1990 and 1998. From 1998 on, it has been closely associated with the Hungarian party [[Fidesz]]. In 2005 Fidesz and the KDNP signed an agreement for election cooperation, a result of which the KDNP obtained seats in the National Assembly. In the 2006 elections this alliance gained strength, winning 42.0% of the list votes and 164 representatives out of 386 in the National Assembly. The party decided to form a self-contained parliamentary faction with 23 representatives.

It was an offshoot of the ''Catholic Social Folk Movement'' (KSzN), a civil organization. At the beginning of 1945 they elected Barankovics as principal secretary.\n\nThe new KDNP enjoyed just four or five months of semi-legality towards the end of World War II. At the end of the war, the communist-dominated post-war authorities refused to legalize it or permit it to operate further. Despite attempts by Varga and Barankovics, they were refused official permission to operate and take part in elections. Some of the party's founders, including Varga, were imprisoned for some days by detachments of the [[Arrow Cross Party]].\n\nMeanwhile, some party members were saying that Barankovics conceded too much to the communist-influenced authorities in return for too little, and there was growing friction between two factions: the Christian socialist left wing led by Barankovics and the conservative-clerical right wing led by [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]'s confidant, J\u00f3zsef P\u00e1lffy. The left wing gained increasing ascendancy in the party, and on 8 May 1945, Barankovics replaced P\u00e1lffy as president. The party changed its name to the '''Democratic People's Party''' (DNP), while a group led by P\u00e1lffy founded a new party called KDNP, which, however, failed to remain legal in an atmosphere of increasing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence. The [[1947 Hungarian parliamentary election|1947 elections]] saw the DNP finish second in the popular vote, winning 60 of the 411 seats.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & St\u00f6ver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p931 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref>\n\nDNP was a democratic and anticommunist organisation. In 1949, [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] asked Barankovics for the party's leaders to help him in the [[show trial]] against Cardinal Mindszenty, who was already ill in prison. Barankovics refused and, abandoning his party, escaped to Austria in an American diplomat's car. Many people followed his example; others were imprisoned by communists. The party was subsequently dissolved in January 1949.<ref>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, p911</ref>\n\n== Refoundation and present ==\n\nThe party was refounded in 1989 with its present name. The link between the historical party and the present one is disputed, although prominent members of the original party, like [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Varga (politician, 1936)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Varga]], took part in its refoundation. It was part of the [[Hungarian National Assembly]] between 1990 and 1998. From 1998 on, it has been closely associated with the Hungarian party [[Fidesz]]. In 2005 Fidesz and the KDNP signed an agreement for election cooperation, a result of which the KDNP obtained seats in the National Assembly. In the 2006 elections this alliance gained strength, winning 42.0% of the list votes and 164 representatives out of 386 in the National Assembly. The party decided to form a self-contained parliamentary faction with 23 representatives. It is the third largest faction in the National Assembly and co-operates closely with the Fidesz faction. {{As of|2019}}, the party leader is [[Zsolt Semj\u00e9n]], deputy prime minister.\n\n==Ideology==\nKDNP is a right-wing, conservative Christian party.

It is also the name of the [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. [[PostScript]]. Metafont was devised by [[Donald Knuth]] as a companion to his [[TeX]] typesetting system.\n\nOne of the characteristics of Metafont is that the points defining the shapes of the [[glyph]]s\u2014for example top of a [[Stem (typography)|stem]], or intersection of a stem and crossbar\u2014are defined with geometrical equations; the intent that the three stems of an \u2018m\u2019 are equally spaced horizontally might be expressed as <math> x_2-x_1 = x_3-x_2 </math> if points 1, 2, and 3 are at the bottom ends of the three stems, whereas the intent that they all end on the same vertical position would be <math> y_1 = y_2 = y_3 </math>.  Another characteristic is that Metafont is a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] language, where operations such as \"draw a lower case top of stem serif at point 4\" might appear as one macro instruction (with the point as argument) in the program for a letter.  For describing shapes, Metafont has a rich set of [[B\u00e9zier cubic|path]] construction operations that mostly relieves the user of having to calculate control points.  Finally, many families of Metafont fonts are set up so that the main source file for a font only defines a small number of design parameters ([[x-height]], em width, slant, vertical stroke width, etc.), then calling a separate source file common for a whole range of fonts to actually draw the individual glyphs; this is the [[meta]] aspect of the system.\n\n==Modes of operation==\nMetafont is most often run as a helper to output device (printer, screen) drivers; in those cases, its job is to generate bitmaps for a font for a specific combination of output device (called a ''mode'' in Metafont) and [[Dots per inch|resolution]] (visible in the name of the output file, see below). These bitmaps are typically stored for later reuse, so that Metafont does not have to be run every time a document is displayed, but on the other hand TeX distributions with a Metafont component have typically not included any prebuilt bitmap fonts, since they would be rather large in comparison to the sources from which they could be generated. Since Metafont fonts were traditionally the TeX default from which other font formats were exceptions, an incomplete installation of a non-Metafont font can sometimes result in Metafont being called and emitting a confusing \"''somefont''.mf not found\" error message.\n\nEqually important, but not as common, is running Metafont to generate a font metric (TFM) file; a TFM file is only generated if the ''fontmaking'' variable is positive. Traditionally TeX distributions have often come with all TFM files pregenerated (since they are pretty small), but someone installing a Metafont font from sources will have to generate its TFM file before TeX can use it.\n\nA third way of operating Metafont is ''proof mode'': if the ''proofing'' variable is positive then the bitmap font file also contains additional information provided via <code>special</code> commands, in particular the positions and names of points the font designer considered important for the design. If using the separate <code>gftodvi</code> utility to generate enlarged images of the font glyphs, this  information from specials is included; point positions are not limited to pixel resolution.\n\nMetafont can also be run interactively, and has commands for displaying on the screen the images it produces. Knuth has said that he uses Metafont as a kind of desk calculator for solving complicated equations, though he now uses MetaPost for mathematical illustrations.\n<!-- could say something here about alternatives \u2013 e.g. vector versions such as pdftex uses -->\n\nMetafont can render any kind of graphical output, not just glyphs. However, [[MetaPost]] and [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] are preferred for mathematical illustrations. Metafont is most commonly invoked without a direct request from the user. [[DVI file format|DVI files]] can only contain references to typefaces, rather than the sets of raster or vector glyphs that other formats like PostScript allow. Consequently, the glyphs in the typefaces need to be accessed whenever a request is made to view, print or convert a DVI file.\n\n===Output files===\nMetafont outputs several kinds of files: for a file called NAME.mf, it can output:\n\n* NAME.NNNNgf \u2013 File with raster output at resolution NNNN (2602 by default). \n* NAME.tfm \u2013 File with [[TeX font metric]] information, which is the information TeX needs. Usually metafont has to be told to generate this file.\n* NAME.log \u2013 Log file output from processing\n\nAfter running Metafont, typically one uses the gftopk program to convert the NNNNgf files to pk (packed) format (.NNNNpk). The pk format was primarily introduced to reduce file size (to about half), but expected to also speed up processing since less data would have to be [[input/output]]. The GF and PK formats both employ [[run-length encoding]] of bitmaps, but make different binary encodings of the run-lengths. The PK format also does some preprocessing of the bitmaps (bounding box, eliding repeated rows) and encodes all rows of a character as one long bit-sequence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rokicki |first1=Tomas |title=Packed (PK) Font File Format |journal=TUGboat |date=1985 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013120 |url=https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb06-3/tb13pk.pdf |accessdate=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''TeX Directory Structure'' standard, filenames are limited to 8+3 characters, so GF and PK files would only have extensions <code>.gf</code> and <code>.pk</code>. Files for different resolutions are kept apart by placing them in separate directories, named <code>dpi</code>NNNN, e.g. <code>dpi300/cmr10.pk</code>.\n\n==Language==\nThe Metafont language is an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language for programs that are ''essentially [[declarative programming|declarative]] rather than [[imperative programming|imperative]]''.<ref name=\"METAFONTbook\">{{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald |title=The METAFONTbook |date=1986 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=0-201-13445-4}}</ref>\n\n===Variables and equations===\nVariables in Metafont can be of eight different types:\n* Numeric: [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] signed numbers with an [[machine epsilon|epsilon]] of <math>2^{-16}</math>, capped to be less than 4096 ([[Q (number format)|Q12.16]]). This is the default for variables not declared to be of another type.\n* Pair: a pair of numerics, used primarily for representing points in the plane.\n* Path: as in [[PostScript]]/[[PDF]]/[[SVG]], a [[parametric curve]] in the plane whose coordinate functions are [[piecewise]] cubic polynomials. As in those other systems, path segments are encoded as [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s in terms of knots and control points.\n* Transform: an [[affine transformation]] of the plane, equivalent to a \"(transformation) matrix\" in PostScript/PDF.\n* Pen: a convex polygon, representing the shape of a \"pen\" used for drawing.\n* Picture: a [[raster graphics|raster image]] with a signed integer value for each pixel.\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]\n* String (of 8-bit characters)\n[[Metapost]] adds color (a triple of numerics) as a ninth type and has a completely different (non-raster) model for pictures; the latter is the main point of divergence between the two programs. Metafont vardef macros also live in the same namespace as variables and may in some ways be regarded as a ninth type of variable, although macros do not exist as [[first-class citizen|first-class]] values in Metafont.\n\nUnusually, the names of variables are not simple tokens, but sequences of symbolic tokens and numeric indices; the variable name <code>x2r</code> is thus not one [[alphanumeric]] token, but a sequence of the three tokens <code>x</code> (symbolic), <code>2</code> (numeric), and <code>r</code> (symbolic). [[Record (computer science)|Record]] and [[Array data type|array]] types may be simulated through collections of variables that share a common name prefix, an idiom supported by the type declaration system giving all variables whose names which differ only in numeric indices the same type (as expected for arrays) while keeping variables whole name differ in some symbolic token separate (as expected for records).\n\nA very distinctive feature of Metafont is the use of [[equation]]s to define variables. A numeric variable (or component of a pair or transformation variable) may be in the three states ''known'' (set), ''unknown independent'' (not set), and ''unknown dependent'' (not set, but given by a [[Linear function (calculus)|linear expression]] of one or several independents). When Metafont executes an equation statement, it turns one of the independents involved into a dependent and eliminates it from the expressions for all other dependents; when no independents remain in the expression for a dependent variable, that variable becomes known. Solving [[system of linear equations|''linear'' equation systems]] thus is a built-in feature of the Metafont language, and the recommended method of assigning most variables (especially those whose values have geometric significance) is to state equations determining their values. Equation systems frequently mix numeric (scalar) equations with pair (vector) equations.\n\nAn exception to the above is the class of ''internal quantity'' variables. These have names consisting of just one symbolic token, are always numeric, and are always known. They have a more direct internal representation than ordinary variables, making it convenient for primitive operations in Metafont (or extentions thereof) to use them implicitly.\n\n===Syntax===\nMetafont has numeric and string constant tokens with mainstream syntaxes; strings are delimited by <code>\"</code> quotes, numeric constants can have decimals but not an [[scientific notation|exponent part]]. All other tokens are classified as ''symbolic'', and can be redefined arbitrarily; there is no restriction that tokens with certain meanings must have names consisting of certain characters. At runtime, there can additionally be ''capsule'' tokens, which are effectively constant value tokens of arbitrary type; in the source code those appear as symbolic tokens.\n\nExcept where characters are involved in numeric or string constants, the extent of the token containing a particular character depends on to which class the character belongs; unlike [[TeX]], Metafont has fixed character classes. The characters <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code> are \"loners\" and only form single character tokens. For the character classes <code><=>:|</code>, <code>\u2018\u2019</code> (single quotes), <code>+-</code>, <code>/*\\</code>, <code>!?</code>, <code>#&@$</code>, <code>^~</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>{}</code>, and <code>.</code>, as well as the class of underscore together with upper and lower case A\u2013Z, the token consists of the longest consecutive sequence of characters from the same class. Whitespace characters don't contribute tokens. <code>%</code> starts a comment lasting until end of line.\n\nA notable application of these rules is that <code>#</code> is frequently appearing as part of variable names in Metafont code, e.g. <code>em#</code> and <code>pt#</code>.\n\nDelimiters (such as parentheses) do not have built-in meanings, instead there is a command that turns two symbolic tokens into a pair of matching delimiters, but normally Metafont programs use only the ordinary parentheses.

Thus, rather than describing the outline of the glyph directly, a Metafont file describes the pen paths. Some simpler Metafont fonts, such as the calligraphic mathematics fonts in the [[Computer Modern]] family, use a single pen stroke with a relatively large pen to define each visual \"stroke\" of the glyphs. More complex fonts such as the [[Roman type|Roman]] text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual \"strokes\", which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners defined by the pen shape.\n\nSince the font shapes are defined by equations rather than directly coded numbers, it is possible to treat parameters such as aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width, [[serif]] size, and so forth as input parameters in each glyph definition (which then define not a single font, but a [[meta]]-font). Thus, by changing the value of one of these parameters at one location in the Metafont file, one can produce a consistent change throughout the entire font. Computer Modern Roman illustrates many uses of this feature; a typical TeX installation includes a number of versions of the font in sizes from 5pt to 17pt, with the stroke widths the same in all sizes (rather than increasing as the font is scaled up) and aspect ratios widening in the smaller sizes for increased legibility. In addition, the Computer Modern typewriter and [[sans-serif]] fonts are defined using essentially the same Metafont file as the Roman font, but with different global parameters.\n\n==Use==\nWhile well-known type designers, such as [[Hermann Zapf]], have collaborated with Knuth to create new fonts using Metafont, the system has not been widely adopted by professional type designers. Knuth attributes this to the fact that\n\"asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too much.\"<ref>CSTUG, Charles University, Prague, March 1996, Questions and Answers with Prof. Donald E.

Due to shortcomings in the original Metafont language, Knuth developed an entirely new Metafont system in 1984, and it is this revised system that is used today; Metafont has a versioning system similar to that of [[TeX]], where the number [[asymptotically]] approaches ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' with each revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/abcde.html#bugs|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe following example creates a closed beanlike shape for the character \"B\" of a font:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n%file name: beta.mf\n%mode_setup;\n% Define a beanlike shape for the character B\nbeginchar(\"B\",11pt#,11pt#,0);\n  % Setup coordinates as an equation system\n  y1=y2=y3=0;\n  y4=y5=y6=h;\n  x1=x4=0;\n  x2=x5=w;\n  x3=x6=2*w;\n\n  % Define pen\n  pickup pencircle xscaled 0.2w yscaled 0.04w rotated 45;\n\n  % Draw the character curve\n  % z1 is the same as (x1, y1)\n  draw z1..z3..z6{z2-z6}..z5..{z4-z2}z4..cycle;\nendchar;\n\nend\n</source>\nThis yields the following glyph:\n\n[[File:metafont-example-output.svg|284px]]\n\nThe above example will be processed with a command line such as:<ref name=grandsir>{{cite web|url=http://metafont.tutorial.free.fr/|title=METAFONT Tutorial|author=Christophe Grandsir}}</ref>\n\n<pre>mf '\\mode=ljfour; mode_setup; input beta.mf'; gftopk beta.600gf beta.600pk</pre>\n\nThen it can be used in a LaTeX file such as<ref name=grandsir/> (all files should dwell in the same directory or the TeX system should be informed about them using appropriate methods):\n<source lang=\"latex\">\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newfont{\\letterbeta}{beta}\n\\newcommand{\\otherbeta}{{\\letterbeta B}}\n\n\\begin{document}\nLet's try having a strange \\otherbeta\\ here.\n\\end{document}\n</source>\nThe resulting PDF file should look like this:\n[[File:Tex mf beta.pdf|187px]]\n\n==Producing PostScript Type 1 fonts==\nThere are several tools for converting Metafont programs to [[PostScript Type 1]] fonts. Most make use of [[MetaPost]]'s ability to convert a subset of Metafont's language into [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] outlines, which can subsequently be converted to PostScript Type 1 fonts. Generating vector outlines of Metafont pen strokes is nontrivial, as the Metafont model of a glyph is a raster image and the exact outlines of most strokes are not [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s.{{NoteTag|Technically, Metafont ''does'' generate vector outlines as an intermediate step of rasterising a stroke, but those intermediate outlines are tailored to the current raster resolution and non-simple as curves, so they are very far from being usable as Type 1 outlines. An effect of the non-simplicity is spurious pixels on the concave side of a stroke that get a value of 2 rather than 1, however the automatic culling of pictures being shipped out as glyphs in a font normally prevents this from showing up in the final bitmap.}}\n\n* The Polish [[JNS team]] developed [[METATYPE1]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1/|title=CTAN: tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1|publisher=}}</ref> (based on MetaPost) for creating PostScript Type 1 fonts. Its big disadvantage is that no pens may be used which highly reduces the power of Metafont language. Initially, tool has been used by the Polish [[TeX|GUST]] typeface foundry to produce a modernized and extended variant of [[Computer Modern]], called [[Latin Modern]].\n* [[mf2pt1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/mf2pt1/|title=CTAN: tex-archive/support/mf2pt1|publisher=}}</ref> which is also based on Metapost, was developed by Scott Pakin with some contributions from [[Werner Lemberg]]. It also has several limitations detailed in its manual, the most significant one being the restriction that each glyph must be drawn entirely from closed paths. In order to overcome the limitations of mf2pt1, the EPS output by Metapost can be post-processed with [[FontForge]], which is capable of interpreting complex PostScript paths generated by Metapost from Metafont's elliptic pens, and also capable of removing contour overlaps. Since FontForge supports scripting, this post-processing step can also be automated. This approach was used to produce Type 1 outlines for the [[MnSymbol]] mathematical font developed by Achim Blumensath; MnSymbol was designed as a companion to [[Minion (typeface)|Minion Pro]].\n* [[MetaFog]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-3/tb48kinc.pdf|title=R.

It is also the name of the [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. [[PostScript]]. Metafont was devised by [[Donald Knuth]] as a companion to his [[TeX]] typesetting system.\n\nOne of the characteristics of Metafont is that the points defining the shapes of the [[glyph]]s\u2014for example top of a [[Stem (typography)|stem]], or intersection of a stem and crossbar\u2014are defined with geometrical equations; the intent that the three stems of an \u2018m\u2019 are equally spaced horizontally might be expressed as <math> x_2-x_1 = x_3-x_2 </math> if points 1, 2, and 3 are at the bottom ends of the three stems, whereas the intent that they all end on the same vertical position would be <math> y_1 = y_2 = y_3 </math>.  Another characteristic is that Metafont is a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] language, where operations such as \"draw a lower case top of stem serif at point 4\" might appear as one macro instruction (with the point as argument) in the program for a letter.  For describing shapes, Metafont has a rich set of [[B\u00e9zier cubic|path]] construction operations that mostly relieves the user of having to calculate control points.  Finally, many families of Metafont fonts are set up so that the main source file for a font only defines a small number of design parameters ([[x-height]], em width, slant, vertical stroke width, etc.), then calling a separate source file common for a whole range of fonts to actually draw the individual glyphs; this is the [[meta]] aspect of the system.\n\n==Modes of operation==\nMetafont is most often run as a helper to output device (printer, screen) drivers; in those cases, its job is to generate bitmaps for a font for a specific combination of output device (called a ''mode'' in Metafont) and [[Dots per inch|resolution]] (visible in the name of the output file, see below). These bitmaps are typically stored for later reuse, so that Metafont does not have to be run every time a document is displayed, but on the other hand TeX distributions with a Metafont component have typically not included any prebuilt bitmap fonts, since they would be rather large in comparison to the sources from which they could be generated. Since Metafont fonts were traditionally the TeX default from which other font formats were exceptions, an incomplete installation of a non-Metafont font can sometimes result in Metafont being called and emitting a confusing \"''somefont''.mf not found\" error message.\n\nEqually important, but not as common, is running Metafont to generate a font metric (TFM) file; a TFM file is only generated if the ''fontmaking'' variable is positive. Traditionally TeX distributions have often come with all TFM files pregenerated (since they are pretty small), but someone installing a Metafont font from sources will have to generate its TFM file before TeX can use it.\n\nA third way of operating Metafont is ''proof mode'': if the ''proofing'' variable is positive then the bitmap font file also contains additional information provided via <code>special</code> commands, in particular the positions and names of points the font designer considered important for the design. If using the separate <code>gftodvi</code> utility to generate enlarged images of the font glyphs, this  information from specials is included; point positions are not limited to pixel resolution.\n\nMetafont can also be run interactively, and has commands for displaying on the screen the images it produces. Knuth has said that he uses Metafont as a kind of desk calculator for solving complicated equations, though he now uses MetaPost for mathematical illustrations.\n<!-- could say something here about alternatives \u2013 e.g. vector versions such as pdftex uses -->\n\nMetafont can render any kind of graphical output, not just glyphs. However, [[MetaPost]] and [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] are preferred for mathematical illustrations. Metafont is most commonly invoked without a direct request from the user. [[DVI file format|DVI files]] can only contain references to typefaces, rather than the sets of raster or vector glyphs that other formats like PostScript allow. Consequently, the glyphs in the typefaces need to be accessed whenever a request is made to view, print or convert a DVI file.\n\n===Output files===\nMetafont outputs several kinds of files: for a file called NAME.mf, it can output:\n\n* NAME.NNNNgf \u2013 File with raster output at resolution NNNN (2602 by default). \n* NAME.tfm \u2013 File with [[TeX font metric]] information, which is the information TeX needs. Usually metafont has to be told to generate this file.\n* NAME.log \u2013 Log file output from processing\n\nAfter running Metafont, typically one uses the gftopk program to convert the NNNNgf files to pk (packed) format (.NNNNpk). The pk format was primarily introduced to reduce file size (to about half), but expected to also speed up processing since less data would have to be [[input/output]]. The GF and PK formats both employ [[run-length encoding]] of bitmaps, but make different binary encodings of the run-lengths. The PK format also does some preprocessing of the bitmaps (bounding box, eliding repeated rows) and encodes all rows of a character as one long bit-sequence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rokicki |first1=Tomas |title=Packed (PK) Font File Format |journal=TUGboat |date=1985 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013120 |url=https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb06-3/tb13pk.pdf |accessdate=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''TeX Directory Structure'' standard, filenames are limited to 8+3 characters, so GF and PK files would only have extensions <code>.gf</code> and <code>.pk</code>. Files for different resolutions are kept apart by placing them in separate directories, named <code>dpi</code>NNNN, e.g. <code>dpi300/cmr10.pk</code>.\n\n==Language==\nThe Metafont language is an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language for programs that are ''essentially [[declarative programming|declarative]] rather than [[imperative programming|imperative]]''.<ref name=\"METAFONTbook\">{{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald |title=The METAFONTbook |date=1986 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=0-201-13445-4}}</ref>\n\n===Variables and equations===\nVariables in Metafont can be of eight different types:\n* Numeric: [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] signed numbers with an [[machine epsilon|epsilon]] of <math>2^{-16}</math>, capped to be less than 4096 ([[Q (number format)|Q12.16]]). This is the default for variables not declared to be of another type.\n* Pair: a pair of numerics, used primarily for representing points in the plane.\n* Path: as in [[PostScript]]/[[PDF]]/[[SVG]], a [[parametric curve]] in the plane whose coordinate functions are [[piecewise]] cubic polynomials. As in those other systems, path segments are encoded as [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s in terms of knots and control points.\n* Transform: an [[affine transformation]] of the plane, equivalent to a \"(transformation) matrix\" in PostScript/PDF.\n* Pen: a convex polygon, representing the shape of a \"pen\" used for drawing.\n* Picture: a [[raster graphics|raster image]] with a signed integer value for each pixel.\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]\n* String (of 8-bit characters)\n[[Metapost]] adds color (a triple of numerics) as a ninth type and has a completely different (non-raster) model for pictures; the latter is the main point of divergence between the two programs. Metafont vardef macros also live in the same namespace as variables and may in some ways be regarded as a ninth type of variable, although macros do not exist as [[first-class citizen|first-class]] values in Metafont.\n\nUnusually, the names of variables are not simple tokens, but sequences of symbolic tokens and numeric indices; the variable name <code>x2r</code> is thus not one [[alphanumeric]] token, but a sequence of the three tokens <code>x</code> (symbolic), <code>2</code> (numeric), and <code>r</code> (symbolic). [[Record (computer science)|Record]] and [[Array data type|array]] types may be simulated through collections of variables that share a common name prefix, an idiom supported by the type declaration system giving all variables whose names which differ only in numeric indices the same type (as expected for arrays) while keeping variables whole name differ in some symbolic token separate (as expected for records).\n\nA very distinctive feature of Metafont is the use of [[equation]]s to define variables. A numeric variable (or component of a pair or transformation variable) may be in the three states ''known'' (set), ''unknown independent'' (not set), and ''unknown dependent'' (not set, but given by a [[Linear function (calculus)|linear expression]] of one or several independents). When Metafont executes an equation statement, it turns one of the independents involved into a dependent and eliminates it from the expressions for all other dependents; when no independents remain in the expression for a dependent variable, that variable becomes known. Solving [[system of linear equations|''linear'' equation systems]] thus is a built-in feature of the Metafont language, and the recommended method of assigning most variables (especially those whose values have geometric significance) is to state equations determining their values. Equation systems frequently mix numeric (scalar) equations with pair (vector) equations.\n\nAn exception to the above is the class of ''internal quantity'' variables. These have names consisting of just one symbolic token, are always numeric, and are always known. They have a more direct internal representation than ordinary variables, making it convenient for primitive operations in Metafont (or extentions thereof) to use them implicitly.\n\n===Syntax===\nMetafont has numeric and string constant tokens with mainstream syntaxes; strings are delimited by <code>\"</code> quotes, numeric constants can have decimals but not an [[scientific notation|exponent part]]. All other tokens are classified as ''symbolic'', and can be redefined arbitrarily; there is no restriction that tokens with certain meanings must have names consisting of certain characters. At runtime, there can additionally be ''capsule'' tokens, which are effectively constant value tokens of arbitrary type; in the source code those appear as symbolic tokens.\n\nExcept where characters are involved in numeric or string constants, the extent of the token containing a particular character depends on to which class the character belongs; unlike [[TeX]], Metafont has fixed character classes. The characters <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code> are \"loners\" and only form single character tokens. For the character classes <code><=>:|</code>, <code>\u2018\u2019</code> (single quotes), <code>+-</code>, <code>/*\\</code>, <code>!?</code>, <code>#&@$</code>, <code>^~</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>{}</code>, and <code>.</code>, as well as the class of underscore together with upper and lower case A\u2013Z, the token consists of the longest consecutive sequence of characters from the same class. Whitespace characters don't contribute tokens. <code>%</code> starts a comment lasting until end of line.\n\nA notable application of these rules is that <code>#</code> is frequently appearing as part of variable names in Metafont code, e.g. <code>em#</code> and <code>pt#</code>.\n\nDelimiters (such as parentheses) do not have built-in meanings, instead there is a command that turns two symbolic tokens into a pair of matching delimiters, but normally Metafont programs use only the ordinary parentheses. Besides to override priorities in expressions, delimiters are also required around certain kinds of macro arguments.\n\n===Graphics===\nCurves in Metafont are defined as [[cubic spline]]s rather than quadratic, for greater versatility at the cost of more complex arithmetic.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Knuth|first=Donald|subject-link=Donald Knuth|interviewer=Advogato|title=Interview: Donald E.

Due to shortcomings in the original Metafont language, Knuth developed an entirely new Metafont system in 1984, and it is this revised system that is used today; Metafont has a versioning system similar to that of [[TeX]], where the number [[asymptotically]] approaches ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' with each revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/abcde.html#bugs|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe following example creates a closed beanlike shape for the character \"B\" of a font:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n%file name: beta.mf\n%mode_setup;\n% Define a beanlike shape for the character B\nbeginchar(\"B\",11pt#,11pt#,0);\n  % Setup coordinates as an equation system\n  y1=y2=y3=0;\n  y4=y5=y6=h;\n  x1=x4=0;\n  x2=x5=w;\n  x3=x6=2*w;\n\n  % Define pen\n  pickup pencircle xscaled 0.2w yscaled 0.04w rotated 45;\n\n  % Draw the character curve\n  draw z1..z3..z6{z2-z6}..z5..{z4-z2}z4..cycle;\nendchar;\n\nend\n</source>\nThis yields the following glyph:\n\n[[File:metafont-example-output.svg|284px]]\n\nThe above example will be processed with a command line such as:<ref name=grandsir>{{cite web|url=http://metafont.tutorial.free.fr/|title=METAFONT Tutorial|author=Christophe Grandsir}}</ref>\n\n<pre>mf '\\mode=ljfour; mode_setup; input beta.mf'; gftopk beta.600gf beta.600pk</pre>\n\nThen it can be used in a LaTeX file such as<ref name=grandsir/> (all files should dwell in the same directory or the TeX system should be informed about them using appropriate methods):\n<source lang=\"latex\">\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newfont{\\letterbeta}{beta}\n\\newcommand{\\otherbeta}{{\\letterbeta B}}\n\n\\begin{document}\nLet's try having a strange \\otherbeta\\ here.\n\\end{document}\n</source>\nThe resulting PDF file should look like this:\n[[File:Tex mf beta.pdf|187px]]\n\n==Producing PostScript Type 1 fonts==\nThere are several tools for converting Metafont programs to [[PostScript Type 1]] fonts. Most make use of [[MetaPost]]'s ability to convert a subset of Metafont's language into [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] outlines, which can subsequently be converted to PostScript Type 1 fonts. Generating vector outlines of Metafont pen strokes is nontrivial, as the Metafont model of a glyph is a raster image and the exact outlines of most strokes are not [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s.{{NoteTag|Technically, Metafont ''does'' generate vector outlines as an intermediate step of rasterising a stroke, but those intermediate outlines are tailored to the current raster resolution and non-simple as curves, so they are very far from being usable as Type 1 outlines. An effect of the non-simplicity is spurious pixels on the concave side of a stroke that get a value of 2 rather than 1, however the automatic culling of pictures being shipped out as glyphs in a font normally prevents this from showing up in the final bitmap.}}\n\n* The Polish [[JNS team]] developed [[METATYPE1]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1/|title=CTAN: tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1|publisher=}}</ref> (based on MetaPost) for creating PostScript Type 1 fonts. Its big disadvantage is that no pens may be used which highly reduces the power of Metafont language. Initially, tool has been used by the Polish [[TeX|GUST]] typeface foundry to produce a modernized and extended variant of [[Computer Modern]], called [[Latin Modern]].\n* [[mf2pt1]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/mf2pt1/|title=CTAN: tex-archive/support/mf2pt1|publisher=}}</ref> which is also based on Metapost, was developed by Scott Pakin with some contributions from [[Werner Lemberg]]. It also has several limitations detailed in its manual, the most significant one being the restriction that each glyph must be drawn entirely from closed paths. In order to overcome the limitations of mf2pt1, the EPS output by Metapost can be post-processed with [[FontForge]], which is capable of interpreting complex PostScript paths generated by Metapost from Metafont's elliptic pens, and also capable of removing contour overlaps. Since FontForge supports scripting, this post-processing step can also be automated. This approach was used to produce Type 1 outlines for the [[MnSymbol]] mathematical font developed by Achim Blumensath; MnSymbol was designed as a companion to [[Minion (typeface)|Minion Pro]].\n* [[MetaFog]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-3/tb48kinc.pdf|title=R. J. Kinch, \"MetaFog: converting Metafont shapes to contours\", ''TUGboat'' '''16(3)''', 233\u201343 (1995)}}</ref> is a proprietary converter that can analytically convert pen strokes, but it requires manual post processing to eliminate degenerate cases, and it is not publicly available. It can process only Metapost output.<ref>K. P\u00ed\u0161ka, 2004</ref>\n\nThe common approach to generate Type 1 fonts with pen strokes remains to generate a high-resolution bitmap and then using an [[autotracer]], implemented by packages such as [[mftrace]]<ref>[http://lilypond.org/mftrace/ mftrace] \u2013 a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap font into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font) or TTF (TrueType) font.

It was created by Laura Gibson and developed by Charlie Bennett. The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]].

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth. At the allocation ceremony, the remaining contestants all split the prize money since they all experienced personal growth in their dating life.\n\nSeveral publications have compared the format of ''Too Hot to Handle'' to that of ''[[Love Island (franchise)|Love Island]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Curto |first1=Justin |title=Netflix\u2019s Too Hot to Handle Will Fill the Love Is Blind\u2013Size Hole in Your Life |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-trailer-netflix.html |website=vulture.com |publisher=Vulture |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Baty |first1=Emma |title=Netflix Just Made Their Own Version of 'Love Island,' but the Contestants Can\u2019t Hook Up With Each Other |url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a32109096/netflix-too-hot-to-handle-trailer/ |website=cosmopolitan.com |publisher=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
