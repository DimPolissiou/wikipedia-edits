In it, Hancock examines [[paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave art]] in the light of [[David Lewis-Williams]]' [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] model, exploring its relation to the development of the fully modern human mind.\n\nIn 2015, his ''[[Magicians of the Gods|Magicians of the Gods: The Forgotten Wisdom of Earth's Lost Civilization]]'' was published by St. Martin's Press.\n\nHis first novel, ''Entangled: The Eater of Souls'', the first in a fantasy series, was published in the UK in April 2010 and in the US in October 2010. The novel makes use of Hancock's prior research interests and as he has noted, \"What was there to lose, I asked myself, when my critics already described my factual books as fiction?\"\n\n==Orion correlation theory==\n{{main|Orion correlation theory}}\n\n[[File:orion - pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|Representation of the central tenet of the [[Orion Correlation Theory|OCT]] \u2013 the outline of the Giza pyramids superimposed over a photograph of the stars in Orion's Belt. To achieve this concordance the pyramids have been rotated and scaled to suit. The validity of this match has been called into question by Hancock's critics, as noted in the text.]]\n\nOne of the many recurring themes in several of Hancock's works has been an exposition on the \"[[Orion correlation theory]]\" (or OCT),<ref>Graham Hancock, Santha Faiia.''Heaven's Mirror: Quest For The Lost Civilization'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1998). {{ISBN|0-7181-4332-9}}</ref><ref>Glenn Kreisberg (editor), ''Lost Knowledge of the Ancients: A Graham Hancock Reader'' (Bear & Company, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1-59143-117-6}}</ref> supported by Belgian writer [[Robert Bauval]] and then further expounded in collaborative works with Hancock, as well as in their separate publications. OCT posits that there is a correlation between the location of the three largest [[pyramid]]s of the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and [[Orion's Belt]] of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]], as intended as such by the original builders of the Giza pyramid complex.\n\n==BBC ''Horizon'' controversy==\n[[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' TV series broadcast a programme, ''Atlantis Reborn'', on 4 November 1999 that challenged the ideas presented by Hancock.  It detailed one of Hancock's claims that the arrangement of an ancient temple complex was designed to mirror astronomical features and attempted to demonstrate that the same thing could be done with perhaps equal justification using famous landmarks in New York. It also alleged that Hancock had selectively moved or ignored the locations of some of the temples to fit his own theories (see below).<ref name=\"synop\">{{cite web |year=2000 |title= Atlantis Reborn Again &#123;programme synopsis&#125; |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain.shtml |work= Science & Nature: Horizon |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate= 1 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nHancock claimed he was misrepresented by the programme, and he and [[Robert Bauval]] made complaints to the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] against the way ''Horizon'' had portrayed them and their work. Eight points were raised by Hancock, two by Bauval (one of which duplicated a complaint of Hancock's).<ref>{{cite web |work= Science & Nature: Horizon |year=2000 |title=''Horizon: Atlantis Reborn'' and the Broadcasting Standards Commission |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc.shtml |publisher= BBC |accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref> These included the complaint that:\n<blockquote>\nThe programme had created the impression that he [Hancock] was an intellectual fraudster who had put forward half-baked theories and ideas in bad faith, and that he was incompetent to defend his own arguments.\nAdjudication: [The Commission] finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in these matters.<ref>{{cite web |author=Broadcasting Standards Commission  |year=2000 |title=Synopsis of adjudication: ''Horizon: Atlantis Reborn'' (November 4th 1999) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc_synopsis.shtml |format=reproduced at BBC Online|work=Science & Nature: Horizon |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe BSC dismissed all but one of the complaints. Overall, the BSC concluded that \"the programme makers acted in good faith in their examination of the theories of Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval\".<ref>{{cite journal|date=30 November 2000|title=Fairness Complaints|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/bsc/pdfs/bulletin/bulletin37.pdf|format=PDF online reproduction|journal=The Bulletin|location=London|publisher=[[Broadcasting Standards Commission]]|volume=37|pages=1\u20133|author=Broadcasting Standards Commission|accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref> The complaint which was upheld was that <blockquote>The programme unfairly omitted one of their arguments in rebuttal of a speaker who criticised the theory of a significant correlation between the Giza pyramids and the belt stars of the constellation Orion (the \"correlation theory\")</blockquote> which the Commission did find to be unfair.  That speaker was the astronomer [[Edwin Krupp]]. Krupp argued that Bauval had fudged the maps of Orion and the Pyramids by placing them upside down in terms of stellar directionality to make the theory work.<ref name=synop/> The BBC was not obligated to do more than broadcast an apology for the single point of unfairness but made a decision to modify the Orion sequence to demonstrate that the overall argument of the film remained intact.\n\nIn ''Atlantis Reborn Again'', shown on 14 December 2000, Hancock and Bauval provided further rebuttals to Krupp and argued that the ancient Egyptians had made the Pyramids correlate with the three stars of Orion's Belt. However, the documentary as a whole continued to present serious doubts about Hancock's claims, demonstrating as an example how, by using his methods, the constellation of Leo may be 'discovered' among landmarks of modern Manhattan, concluding: \"As long as you have enough points and you don't need to make every point fit, you can find virtually any pattern you want.\"<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain_transcript.shtml ''Atlantis Reborn Again''] BBC documentary transcript</ref>\n\n==TEDx talk==\nHancock gave a [[TEDx]] lecture titled \"The War on Consciousness\", in which he described his use of [[ayahuasca]], an amazonian brew containing a hallucinogenic compound [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and argued that adults should be allowed to responsibly use it for self-improvement and spiritual growth. At the recommendation of TED's Science Board, the lecture was removed from the TEDx YouTube channel and moved to TED's main website where it \"can be framed to highlight both [Hancock's] provocative ideas and the factual problems with [his] arguments\".<ref>{{cite|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/14/open-for-discussion-graham-hancock-and-rupert-sheldrake|title=News TEDx \u2013 Open for discussion: Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake from TEDx Whitechapel|date=14 March 2013|website=TED Blog|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nIn 2009, [[Roland Emmerich]] released his blockbuster disaster movie ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', citing ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' in the credits as an inspiration for the film,<ref name=\"2012-credit-list\">{{cite web|url=http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf|title=2012 (2009) \u2013 Credit List|accessdate=25 November 2009|publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}</ref> stating: \"I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook.

In it, Hancock examines [[paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave art]] in the light of [[David Lewis-Williams]]' [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] model, exploring its relation to the development of the fully modern human mind.\n\nIn 2015, his ''[[Magicians of the Gods|Magicians of the Gods: The Forgotten Wisdom of Earth's Lost Civilization]]'' was published by St. Martin's Press.\n\nHis first novel, ''Entangled: The Eater of Souls'', the first in a fantasy series, was published in the UK in April 2010 and in the US in October 2010. The novel makes use of Hancock's prior research interests and as he has noted, \"What was there to lose, I asked myself, when my critics already described my factual books as fiction?\"\n\n==Orion correlation theory==\n{{main|Orion correlation theory}}\n\n[[File:orion - pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|Representation of the central tenet of the [[Orion Correlation Theory|OCT]] \u2013 the outline of the Giza pyramids superimposed over a photograph of the stars in Orion's Belt. To achieve this concordance the pyramids have been rotated and scaled to suit. The validity of this match has been called into question by Hancock's critics, as noted in the text.]]\n\nOne of the many recurring themes in several of Hancock's works has been an exposition on the \"[[Orion correlation theory]]\" (or OCT),<ref>Graham Hancock, Santha Faiia.''Heaven's Mirror: Quest For The Lost Civilization'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1998). {{ISBN|0-7181-4332-9}}</ref><ref>Glenn Kreisberg (editor), ''Lost Knowledge of the Ancients: A Graham Hancock Reader'' (Bear & Company, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1-59143-117-6}}</ref> supported by Belgian writer [[Robert Bauval]] and then further expounded in collaborative works with Hancock, as well as in their separate publications. OCT posits that there is a correlation between the location of the three largest [[pyramid]]s of the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and [[Orion's Belt]] of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]], as intended as such by the original builders of the Giza pyramid complex.\n\n==BBC ''Horizon'' controversy==\n[[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' TV series broadcast a programme, ''Atlantis Reborn'', on 4 November 1999 that challenged the ideas presented by Hancock.  It detailed one of Hancock's claims that the arrangement of an ancient temple complex was designed to mirror astronomical features and attempted to demonstrate that the same thing could be done with perhaps equal justification using famous landmarks in New York. It also alleged that Hancock had selectively moved or ignored the locations of some of the temples to fit his own theories (see below).<ref name=\"synop\">{{cite web |year=2000 |title= Atlantis Reborn Again &#123;programme synopsis&#125; |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain.shtml |work= Science & Nature: Horizon |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate= 1 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nHancock claimed he was misrepresented by the programme, and he and [[Robert Bauval]] made complaints to the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] against the way ''Horizon'' had portrayed them and their work. Eight points were raised by Hancock, two by Bauval (one of which duplicated a complaint of Hancock's).<ref>{{cite web |work= Science & Nature: Horizon |year=2000 |title=''Horizon: Atlantis Reborn'' and the Broadcasting Standards Commission |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc.shtml |publisher= BBC |accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref> These included the complaint that:\n<blockquote>\nThe programme had created the impression that he [Hancock] was an intellectual fraudster who had put forward half-baked theories and ideas in bad faith, and that he was incompetent to defend his own arguments.\nAdjudication: [The Commission] finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in these matters.<ref>{{cite web |author=Broadcasting Standards Commission  |year=2000 |title=Synopsis of adjudication: ''Horizon: Atlantis Reborn'' (November 4th 1999) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc_synopsis.shtml |format=reproduced at BBC Online|work=Science & Nature: Horizon |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe BSC dismissed all but one of the complaints. Overall, the BSC concluded that \"the programme makers acted in good faith in their examination of the theories of Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval\".<ref>{{cite journal|date=30 November 2000|title=Fairness Complaints|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/bsc/pdfs/bulletin/bulletin37.pdf|format=PDF online reproduction|journal=The Bulletin|location=London|publisher=[[Broadcasting Standards Commission]]|volume=37|pages=1\u20133|author=Broadcasting Standards Commission|accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref> The complaint which was upheld was that <blockquote>The programme unfairly omitted one of their arguments in rebuttal of a speaker who criticised the theory of a significant correlation between the Giza pyramids and the belt stars of the constellation Orion (the \"correlation theory\")</blockquote> which the Commission did find to be unfair.  That speaker was the astronomer [[Edwin Krupp]]. Krupp argued that Bauval had fudged the maps of Orion and the Pyramids by placing them upside down in terms of stellar directionality to make the theory work.<ref name=synop/> The BBC was not obligated to do more than broadcast an apology for the single point of unfairness but made a decision to modify the Orion sequence to demonstrate that the overall argument of the film remained intact.\n\nIn ''Atlantis Reborn Again'', shown on 14 December 2000, Hancock and Bauval provided further rebuttals to Krupp and argued that the ancient Egyptians had made the Pyramids correlate with the three stars of Orion's Belt. However, the documentary as a whole continued to present serious doubts about Hancock's claims, demonstrating as an example how, by using his methods, the constellation of Leo may be 'discovered' among landmarks of modern Manhattan, concluding: \"As long as you have enough points and you don't need to make every point fit, you can find virtually any pattern you want.\"<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain_transcript.shtml ''Atlantis Reborn Again''] BBC documentary transcript</ref>\n\n==TEDx talk==\nHancock gave a [[TEDx]] lecture titled \"The War on Consciousness\", in which he described his use of [[ayahuasca]], an amazonian brew containing a hallucinogenic compound [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and argued that adults should be allowed to responsibly use it for self-improvement and spiritual growth. At the recommendation of TED's Science Board, the lecture was removed from the TEDx YouTube channel and moved to TED's main website where it \"can be framed to highlight both [Hancock's] provocative ideas and the factual problems with [his] arguments\".<ref>{{cite|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/14/open-for-discussion-graham-hancock-and-rupert-sheldrake|title=News TEDx \u2013 Open for discussion: Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake from TEDx Whitechapel|date=14 March 2013|website=TED Blog|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nIn 2009, [[Roland Emmerich]] released his blockbuster disaster movie ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', citing ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' in the credits as an inspiration for the film,<ref name=\"2012-credit-list\">{{cite web|url=http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf|title=2012 (2009) \u2013 Credit List|accessdate=25 November 2009|publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}</ref> stating: \"I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook.
