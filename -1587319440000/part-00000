After evaluating existing OCR designs, it was decided to develop two new fonts: A stylized design with just digits, called \u201cClass A\u201d; and a more conventional type design with broader character coverage, called \u201cClass\u00a0B\u201d. In February 1965, ECMA proposed a design for the \u201cClass B\u201d font to [[ISO]], who adopted it as international standard ISO\u00a01073-2 in October 1965.<ref name=\"ecma11-v3-history\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-11,%203rd%20Edition,%20March%201976.pdf|title=Standard ECMA-11 for the Alphanumeric Character Set OCR-B for Optical Recognition|language=English|publisher=European Computer Manufacturers Association|date=March 1976|at=Section \u201cBrief History\u201d}}</ref> The first revision contained three font sizes: I, II and III. The specification included a ''Letterpress'' design, intended for high-quality printing equipment; and a rounded-edge ''Constant Strokewidth'' design for [[impact printers]]<ref name=\"cen-n837\"/>{{rp|3}} with reduced typographic quality.\n\nIn September 1969, ECMA started work to revise its published standard. To make OCR-B more widely accepted, the shapes of some characters were slightly modified. The new revision removed font size II, which had been rarely used in practice; it deleted five character shapes; and it added a new font size IV. ECMA published the second edition of OCR-B in October 1971.<ref name=\"ecma11-v3-history\"/>\n\nIn March 1976, ECMA published a third revision of its ECMA-11 specification. It added the symbols [[\u00a7]] and [[\u00a5]] to OCR-B; two types of erasure marks (\u2588) for blackening out mis-printed characters were added; and the length of the [[Vertical bar]] was changed to match ISO\u00a01073-2.<ref name=\"ecma11-v3-history\"/>\n\nIn 1993, Turkey proposed extending ISO 1073-2 to include the Turkish letters [[\u011e|\u011e\u011f]], [[\u0130|\u0130\u0131]], and [[\u015e|\u015e\u015f]].<ref name=\"larsson-2000\">{{cite web|title=Notes on transfer of responsibility for OCR-B standards|author=Karl Ivar Larsson|url=http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2000/00265-OCR-B.htm|date=August 8, 2000}}</ref> The request was generalized to extend OCR-B with a number of Latin and Greek letters used in European languages.<ref name=\"iso-1073-n470\"/>{{rp|27}} A revision of the ISO\u00a01073-2:1976 standard was therefore\nstarted, producing three successive draft documents.
