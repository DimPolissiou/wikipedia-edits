The Nova Scotia Council was also known as the Council of Nova Scotia, the Annapolis Council (prior to 1749) and the Halifax Council (after 1749).  After 1749, the Nova Scotia Council was limited to administrative powers and the judicial courts are set separately.\n\nThere was no legislative assembly in British-ruled Nova Scotia from the time of the conquest in 1710 until during the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1758.  The Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations (or simply the Board of Trade) in London through much of the 1750s pressured the various governors in Nova Scotia to establish the [[1st General Assembly of Nova Scotia]]. The lack of civil government with an elected assembly was a drawback to attracting settlers from the older, established colonies of New England where the population was expanding and seeking new lands.  New Englanders wanted guarantees that they would have governmental institutions the same as or similar to what they had become accustomed in New England.  In 1758 the Board of Trade, anxious to attract settlers to found new townships, ordered [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Col. Charles Lawrence]] to hold an election and convene an assembly.<ref>Kenneth S. Paulsen, Ph.D.: [http://genealogy-paulsen.com/Publications/Election_1758.htm The Provincial Election of \"1758: The First Vote in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia\"] in ''The New England Historical and Genealogical Register'' 156:2 (April 2002)</ref>\n\nThe [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] was established in 1758 and the Nova Scotia Council became the Upper House until 1838 when it became the [[Legislative Council of Nova Scotia]], which was dissolved 1929.\n\n== Historical context ==\nSince the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia (1710)]] and the ratification of the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, British control of Nova Scotia had been erratic and ineffectual, betraying the home authorities\u2019 lack of real interest and a seeming absence of policy. The selection of [[Richard Philipps]] as [[List of lieutenant governors of Nova Scotia|governor for Nova Scotia]] to succeed [[Samuel Vetch]] was part of the British government's plan to regulate the untidy affairs of the province. The senior officer at Annapolis Royal \u2013 with the exception of [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]], the only British-occupied part of the province \u2013 was expected to govern the colony, extract a binding oath of allegiance from the resident Acadian population, and maintain authority with four infantry companies who had no regimental affiliation. Governing the scattered Acadians effectively from a crumbling fort at Annapolis was difficult.<ref name=phil>{{cite DCB |first=Maxwell |last=Sutherland |title=Philipps, Richard |volume=3 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/philipps_richard_3E.html}}</ref>\n\nThe members of the Board of Trade and Plantations in London, convinced the government of the need for a change in the methods of running the colony. Philipps pointed out that his appointment would be valueless unless a form of civil government were provided. The final instructions issued in June 1719 reflected Philipps\u2019 views, guiding him to set up a civil government. He arrived in Nova Scotia in April 1720 after wintering in Boston, and created the Nova Scotia Council, consisting of himself and 11 townsmen and officers, and spread the news of his arrival among the Acadians to prepare the ground for the administration of an oath of allegiance. Like [[Thomas Caulfeild]] and [[Francis Nicholson]] before him, he quickly found that the appearance of power without the substance was of little value in overawing the Acadians. He partially lost the initiative three days after his arrival, when Father Justinien Durand came to the fort with 150 Acadians \". . . as if he meant to appear formidable.\" Philipps informed them that his instructions were to invite them to take the oath; Durand threatened they would migrate to Cape Breton.  Philipps stalled by persuading the Annapolis Acadians to choose six [[Deputy (Acadian)|deputies]] to represent them in discussions on the issue.<ref name=phil/>  This occasion is the first recorded formalization of the Acadian deputy system.\n\n=== Acadian Deputies ===\n{{Main|Deputy (Acadian)}}\nThe Nova Scotia Council formalized the Acadian Deputies to represent the interests of Acadians to the council.

The court met four times a year for the administration of justice.  They sat on the first Tues of February, May, August and November. There were eleven councilors.   A quorum required five councilors to be present.  The original Council was sworn in for the first time on April 25, 1720. John Adams was not included in the original Council but was sworn in three days later on April 28, 1720.<ref>Archibald MacMechan.  Nova Scotia Archives III, Original Minutes of His majesty's Council at Annapolis Royal, 1720-1739.  McAlpine Publishing Co., Limited, Halifax, N.S., 1908. pp.1-3.</ref>\n\nJohn Adams went in a company in Sir Charles Hobby's regiment to the capture of Port Royal in 1710, and in Annapolis Adams must have established himself as a trader with Boston very soon after the capture was effected. In the town, as a person of importance, Governor Philipps found him in 1720, and when Philipps organized the council, he soon appointed him one of this board. On the 28th of April, 1720, Adams took his seat on the council, and henceforth until 1740 there was no more active member of the Nova Scotia government than he. In 1725 he was appointed Deputy Collector of the port, and when Col. Lawrence Armstrong, lieutenant-governor of the province, committed suicide, December 5, 1739, Mr. Adams as senior councillor in residence assumed charge of the government. The actual senior member of the council, however, was [[Paul Mascarene]], who had been appointed councillor three days earlier than Adams, and the following March, when Mascarene returned from Boston, where he had been spending the winter, he relieved Mr. Adams of the charge. In a short time, it is said, blindness compelled Adams to relinquish his duties at Annapolis and he then returned to Boston, where we hear little more of him.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/1913t19chaptersinhistor00eatouoft/1913t19chaptersinhistor00eatouoft_djvu.txt  p. 402]</ref>\n\n=== Councilors ===\n*Governor [[Richard Philipps]] (1720\u201322)\nLt Governor John Lawrence Armstrong\n* [[Paul Mascarene]]\n* Rev.

The court met four times a year for the administration of justice.  They sat on the first Tues of February, May, August and November. There were eleven councilors.   A quorum required five councilors to be present.  The original Council was sworn in for the first time on April 25, 1720. John Adams was not included in the original Council but was sworn in three days later on April 28, 1720.<ref>Archibald MacMechan.  Nova Scotia Archives III, Original Minutes of His majesty's Council at Annapolis Royal, 1720-1739.  McAlpine Publishing Co., Limited, Halifax, N.S., 1908. pp.1-3.</ref>\n\nJohn Adams went in a company in Sir Charles Hobby's regiment to the capture of Port Royal in 1710, and in Annapolis Adams must have established himself as a trader with Boston very soon after the capture was effected. In the town, as a person of importance, Governor Philipps found him in 1720, and when Philipps organized the council, he soon appointed him one of this board. On the 28th of April, 1720, Adams took his seat on the council, and henceforth until 1740 there was no more active member of the Nova Scotia government than he. In 1725 he was appointed Deputy Collector of the port, and when Col. Lawrence Armstrong, lieutenant-governor of the province, committed suicide, December 5, 1739, Mr. Adams as senior councillor in residence assumed charge of the government. The actual senior member of the council, however, was [[Paul Mascarene]], who had been appointed councillor three days earlier than Adams, and the following March, when Mascarene returned from Boston, where he had been spending the winter, he relieved Mr. Adams of the charge. In a short time, it is said, blindness compelled Adams to relinquish his duties at Annapolis and he then returned to Boston, where we hear little more of him.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/1913t19chaptersinhistor00eatouoft/1913t19chaptersinhistor00eatouoft_djvu.txt  p. 402]</ref>\n\n=== Councilors ===\n*Governor [[Richard Philipps]] (1720\u201322)\nLt Governor John Lawrence Armstrong\n* [[Paul Mascarene]]\n* Rev.

Entolimod activation of TLR5 triggers NF-\u03baB signaling, mobilizing an innate immune response that drives expression of numerous genes, including inhibitors of apoptosis, scavengers of reactive oxygen species, and a spectrum of protective or regenerative cytokines.\n\n== Radiation countermeasure ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe FDA established the animal efficacy rule in 2002 to permit the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.\n\nEfficacy of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure has been assessed in animal models. These studies demonstrate that a single administration of entolimod given either before or after lethal total body irradiation leads to significant improvement in animal survival.  Entolimod has been shown to reduce radiation damage to both [[hematopoietic]] (HP) and [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) tissues and improve tissue regeneration.\n\nTwo clinical studies that involved administration of a range of doses of entolimod in 150 healthy human subjects have been completed. Both studies demonstrated that administration of entolimod appears to be safe within a certain dose range. The most frequent adverse event associated with entolimod administration was a transient flu-like syndrome, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of the compound.\n\nThe FDA granted entolimod both [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|Fast Track]] and Orphan Drug status for reducing the risk of death following a potentially lethal dose of total body irradiation during or after a radiation disaster.\n\nBoth the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] procure and maintain medical stockpiles to respond to bioterrorist and emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Under a declared state of emergency, countermeasures may be procured for the Strategic National Stockpile under an [[Emergency Use Authorization]] prior to their full FDA licensure approval.\n\n==Oncology==\nPreclinical studies have shown that entolimod has a suppressive effect on growth of TLR5 expressing tumors. Entolimod has also been shown to have an effect on several animal models of liver metastasis, regardless of TLR5 expression. Additionally, entolimod evidences a supportive care benefit in preclinical models when combined with radiation treatment and [[cytotoxic agents]] with adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects. Tissue protective effects of TLR5 agonists are limited to normal tissues and do not involve protection of tumors from treatment.\n\nA Phase I advanced solid tumor study is currently ongoing at [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]]. The Principal Investigator for this trial is Alex Adjei, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Chair of the Department of Medicine and Senior Vice President of Clinical Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01527136|Entolimod in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, entolimod may also be developed as an adjuvant to standard radiation and chemotherapy, which will allow using of more aggressive measures to attack malignant cells and increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n#{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1222805110 |title=Central role of liver in anticancer and radioprotective activities of Toll-like receptor 5 agonist |year=2013 |last1=Burdelya |first1=L.

It was the site of a former [[ferry]] crossing that spanned from the [[Humber Estuary]] to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], serving as a place for ships and boats crossing the [[Humber]] to moor away from the [[tide|tidal flow]]. A port continues to exist nearby and the area's rail access is based at the [[Barrow Haven railway station]], a stop on the [[Barton Line]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Medieval and early modern===\nOn 5 October 1541 [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] conducted a visit to Hull with the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom#History|Privy Council]], subsequently reaching Barrow Haven by water. The then [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] later travelled by horseback to [[Thornton Abbey]].\n\nBetween the Barrow Beck (a local stream) and West Hann Lane, lie the remains of a large [[motte-and-bailey castle]], known as Barrow Castle. Built in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] style, the two large structures stand with a low [[Earthwork (archaeology)#Types of earthwork|motte]] (a section of raised earthwork) situated between them. Extensive excavations were carried out in 1963 to determine the extent of the remains.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Ferry and railway===\nWith the building of the [[railway]] line in 1848, the ferry service gradually disappeared as passengers preferred{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} to embark from [[New Holland, North Lincolnshire|New Holland]], but a market boat operated into the 1940s. The market boat depot was in a ramped building that is now the site where the imported timber is stored.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nFrom its inception in 1848, the railway station consisted of a single open platform on the south side of the railway line to the east of Ferry Road. In the early twentieth century, a wooden ticket office and waiting room, with [[pot-belly stove]], was constructed on the northern side of the railway line. This remained in place until the 1970s but with modernisation, the ticket office was removed to a [[Railway Museum]], in [[Kirton Lindsey]], on the Windmill site.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} Later it was taken to [[Burgh le Marsh]], near [[Skegness]]. An open platform is again in use.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Brickworks===\nBarrow Haven was once renowned for its bricks and pantiles made from clay recovered from the edges of the Humber. Sanderson's and Pearson's brickyards were located on the west bank of the Haven and Foster's and Greenwood's on the east bank. The land formerly occupied by Sanderson's brickyard is now a caravan site and little evidence of the brickyard remains. These brickyards employed primitive, labour-intensive methods of manufacture. Clay was dug by hand during the summer months and stockpiled for use during the rest of the year.  At Pearson's brickyard, the clay was hauled up a slope in metal skips and tipped into the clay mill.  The clay mill rolled and squeezed the excess moisture from the clay and then extruded it into a rectangular shape approximately twenty four inches wide by twelve inches deep. This extrusion was cut into manageable segments with a wire and the segments stored in a cool building to wait collection by the labourers who operated the tile and brick-forming machines. These machines were hand-operated and required considerable strength to crank. The labourers were generally employed on '[[piecework]]' and low-paid. The extruded bricks and pantiles were stored on the shelves of drying-sheds, each approximately fifty yards long. Wooden shutters on the side of the sheds could be adjusted to control the drying rate prior to the bricks and pantiles being taken to the kiln for firing. If the unbaked clay was allowed to dry too rapidly, the bricks and pantiles would develop cracks before firing.  The Haven was an important landing point for [[barge]]s bringing coal to fuel these brickyard kilns from the [[Yorkshire]] coalfields. Once firing began, the kiln was tended night and day as the coal had to be shovelled by hand to keep up the heat. The resulting products were generally high quality and extremely durable.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Haven Inn===\nAn eighteenth-century [[coaching inn]], [[Haven Inn]] is situated on Ferry Road near the intersection with Marsh Lane. Haven Inn was run by [[landlady]] Mrs. Naomi Mason from 1902 to 1943; a Mr. Fred Mason farmed the attached land and some other land in Barrow Haven; Mrs Mason, a farmer's wife as well as landlady, and undertook such duties as milking cows, and making butter and cream cheese for sale at Brigg Market. [[Poultry]] was also kept, and eggs were sent to market. A local bus, owned by Wesley Clark of [[Barrow upon Humber]], took the farmers to [[Brigg]] on Market Day (Thursday). At [[Christmas]] time, poultry were dressed and sold at the market.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Local buildings===\nThe hamlet has the remains of a [[windmill]]. There was a small Wesleyan [[chapel]], now converted into a house; the [[datestone]] has been left in the brickwork.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThere were once [[cottage]]s for workmen along the banks of the [[Humber]] west of the railway bridge. Access was via a footpath that went through a gate at the north-western end of the railway bridge over the Haven or via West Marsh Lane and two wooden gates on either side of the railway line. These cottages were not provided with electricity, water or sanitation facilities. Kerosene lamps, hand pumps and earth toilets were standard. Floors were generally constructed of brick laid directly on the ground and the walls had no [[damp-proof course]]s. Cast iron fireplaces, consisting of a coal-fired open grate with a boiler box on one side and an oven on the other, were the sole means of heating and cooking. Disposal of household rubbish and [[night soil]] consisted of dumping into the [[Humber]] at any convenient tide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A shop stocked with produce through the market boat catered for the immediate needs of the local population, but more substantial purchases required travelling to [[Barton on Humber]], or to [[New Holland, North Lincolnshire|New Holland]] and from there by [[ferry]] to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. An additional shop, run by a Mrs Dee, was on the Barrow Road; it was a [[lean-to]] attached to a house. A coal yard was next to the shop, on the Clew Bridge side of the building, which was first owned by Mr. Dee's, but in the 1930s it was owned by a Clifford Hastings. His coal was delivered by [[barge]] along the Haven. In later years he had a further coal yard just south of the station.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Water===\nThe workers' cottages alongside the river suffered flooding whenever [[spring tide]]s raised the level of the [[Humber]]. These buildings were largely abandoned by the 1960s and were demolished as tidal fortifications and river bank conservation took place along the south bank of the river.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} During this same period, the banks of the haven were raised on both sides, from the mouth of the Haven to as far as the old sluice gates. This minimised the Haven bursting its banks during spring [[tides]] and flooding the houses in the hamlet proper.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe sluice gates, locally known as Clew Gates, marked the point where the spring-fed [[stream]] from [[Barrow upon Humber]] known as the Beck, became the Haven. Approximately 50 metres south of the railway line, a small watercourse, also known locally as 'the clew', drained land from east of Ferry Road into the Haven, passing under Ferry Road through a large pipe. Despite the presence of many salt water-flooded claypits, fresh water springs are common in the area. When the tide is suitable, dabs, flounders and eels can be caught in the haven{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} and the flooded claypits contain roach, perch, tench, bream and eels.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} \n  \nA boatyard and dry dock were situated on the east bank of the Haven, immediately north of the railway line. A re-furbished [[nissen hut]] and slipway are all that remains of what was once a boat building and repair industry for the Humber's two types of sailing barge, the  sloop and the keel. Motor-powered barges, including a Dutch barge and a Humber sloop, still moor in the haven and rest on the mud on their flat bottoms when the tide recedes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Watercress===\nUntil the 1970s there was a commercial [[watercress]] industry, run by the now-defunct '''Greatford Gardens Watercress Company''', using water pumped from artesian bores reaching deep within the limestone strata of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds]]. In some years, the bores became naturally flowing artesian wells when pressure was sufficient to allow the water to reach the surface without the aid of pumps. Spring water with a slight alkalinity, such as that imparted by the limestone strata, is especially suitable for watercress.{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} Some remnants of this industry can be found to the west of the old [[sluice gate]]s, approximately eight hundred yards south of the [[Haven Inn]]. Other watercress beds owned by the company were located to the east of Ferry Road but have now been ploughed over and little evidence remains of their existence. At the eastern location, there were approximately twenty five watercress beds each ten yards wide by one hundred yards long. The beds were built with a slight gradient and water was directed through a channel into the highest end and then allowed flow gently down the length of the bed before leaving through a narrow opening at the lower end. The water then flowed into a channel which directed it into the '''Beck''' approximately fifty yards to the east of the '''Clew Gates'''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The watercress was gathered by hand and put onto wooden trays before being taken to a packing shed where it was divided into bundles, labelled and then the roots cut off. The bunches were then packed into wooden baskets, known as '''chips''' and transported by road to the rail and ferry centre at [[New Holland, North Lincolnshire|New Holland]] for delivery to customers. The severed roots were returned to the watercress bed where they were replanted. The company had similar [[watercress]] farms at [[Healing, Lincolnshire]], [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] and [[Fordingbridge]], Hampshire. The company ceased its operations in '''Barrow Haven''' when it lost its water rights.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Second World War===\nBarrow Haven was also the site for an [[anti-aircraft]] battery,<ref group=\"map\">{{coord|53|41|39|N|0|24|07|W|display=inline|type:landmark}} Anti Aircraft battery</ref> which provided protection for the city of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].

Nevertheless, he certainly did well, becoming principal chaplain in 1746. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, when, disappointed at not obtaining a living, he left the clergy and resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits.\n\nAfter residing in [[Leipzig]] for a time, he returned to [[Edinburgh]] where in January 1757 he succeeded [[David Hume]] as librarian to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (see [[Advocates' Library]]), but soon relinquished this office on becoming tutor in the family of the [[Earl of Bute]].<ref name=\"Essay95\">{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Ferguson|editor=Fania Oz-Saltberger|title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society|url=https://archive.org/details/anessayonhistor00ferggoog|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-44736-4}}</ref>{{rp|xvi}} In 1759 Ferguson became professor of [[natural philosophy]] in the [[University of Edinburgh]], and in 1764 transferred to the chair of \"pneumatics\" ([[mental philosophy]]) \"and [[moral philosophy]]\".\n\nIn 1767, he published his ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'', which was well received and translated into several [[European languages]]. In the mid-1770s he travelled again to the [[European mainland|Continent]] and met [[Voltaire]]. His membership of [[The Poker Club]] is recorded in its minute book of 1776.\n\nIn 1776 appeared his anonymous pamphlet on the [[American Revolution]] in opposition to Dr [[Richard Price]]'s ''[[Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty]]'', in which he sympathised with the views of the [[British legislature]]. In 1778 Ferguson was appointed secretary to the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] which endeavoured, but without success, to negotiate an arrangement with the revolted colonies.\n\nIn 1780 he wrote the article \"History\" for the second edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]].<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204623/Adam-Ferguson</ref> The article is 40 pages long and replaced the article in the first edition, which was only one paragraph.\n\nIn 1783 appeared his ''[[History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic]]''; it became very popular and went through several editions. Ferguson believed that the [[history of the Roman Republic]] during the period of their greatness formed a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which he studied especially. The history reads well and impartially, and displays conscientious use of sources. The influence of the author's military experience shows itself in certain portions of the narrative. Tired of teaching, he resigned his professorship in 1785, and devoted himself to the revision of his lectures, which he published (1792) under the title of ''[[Principles of Moral and Political Science]]''.\n\nIn his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of the history, visited [[Italy]] and some of the principal cities of Europe, where he was received with honour by [[learned societies]]. From 1795 he resided successively at [[Neidpath Castle]] near [[Peebles]], at Hallyards on [[Manor Water]], and at [[St Andrews]], where he died on 22 February 1816.  He is buried in the churchyard of [[St Andrews Cathedral]], against the east wall. His large mural monument includes a carved profile portrait in marble.\n\n==Ethics==\nIn his [[ethical system]] Ferguson treats man as a social being, illustrating his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the [[human race]], he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. [[Victor Cousin]] criticised Ferguson's speculations (see his ''Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale an dix-huiti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'', pt. II., 1839\u20131840):\n\n<blockquote>We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above all his predecessors.</blockquote>\n\nBy this principle Ferguson attempted to reconcile all moral systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} With [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] he admits the power of self-interest or utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation. [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]'s theory of universal benevolence and [[Adam Smith]]'s idea of mutual sympathy (now [[empathy]]) he combines under the law of society. But, as these laws appear as the means rather than the end of human destiny, they remain subordinate to a supreme end, and the supreme end of perfection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn the political part of his system Ferguson follows [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and pleads the cause of well-regulated [[liberty]] and free [[government]]. His contemporaries, with the exception of Hume, regarded his writings as of great importance (see [[Sir Leslie Stephen]], ''English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 2011, p.&nbsp;214).\n\n==Social thought==\nFerguson's ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' (1767) drew on classical authors and contemporary travel literature, to analyze modern commercial society with a critique of its abandonment of civic and communal virtues. Central themes in Ferguson's theory of citizenship are conflict, play, political participation and military valor. He emphasized the ability to put oneself in another's shoes, saying \"fellow-feeling\" was so much an \"appurtenance of human nature\" as to be a \"characteristic of the species.\"  Like his friends [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] as well as other Scottish intellectuals, he stressed the importance of the spontaneous order; that is, that coherent and even effective outcomes might result from the uncoordinated actions of many individuals.\n\nFerguson saw history as a two-tiered synthesis of natural history and social history, to which all humans belong. Natural history is created by [[God]]; so are humans, who are progressive. Social history is, in accordance with this natural progress, made by humans, and because of that factor it experiences occasional setbacks. But in general, humans are empowered by God to pursue progress in social history. Humans live not for themselves but for God's providential plan. He emphasized aspects of medieval [[chivalry]] as ideal [[masculine]] characteristics. British gentleman and young men were advised to dispense with aspects of politeness considered too [[feminine]], such as the constant desire to please, and to adopt less superficial qualities that suggested inner [[virtue]] and [[courtesy]] toward the 'fairer sex.'<ref name=\"Kettler, 1965\">Kettler, ''The Social and Political Thought of Adam Ferguson'' (1965)</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Herman, A., The Scottish Enlightenment, Harper Perennial</ref>\n\nFerguson was a leading advocate of the [[Idea of Progress]]. He believed that the growth of a commercial society through the pursuit of individual self-interest could promote a self-sustaining progress. Yet paradoxically Ferguson also believed that such commercial growth could foster a decline in virtue and thus ultimately lead to a collapse similar to Rome's. Ferguson, a devout [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]], resolved the apparent paradox by placing both developments in the context of a divinely ordained plan that mandated both progress and human free will. For Ferguson, the knowledge that humanity gains through its actions, even those actions resulting in temporary retrogression, form an intrinsic part of its progressive, asymptotic movement toward an ultimately unobtainable perfectibility.<ref>Hill (1997)</ref>\n\nFerguson was influenced by classical humanism and such writers as [[Tacitus]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The fellow members of Edinburgh's Select Society, which included [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], were also major influences. Ferguson believed that civilization is largely about laws that restrict our independence as individuals but provide liberty in the sense of security and justice. He warned that social chaos usually leads to despotism. The members of civil society give up their liberty-as-autonomy, which savages possess, in exchange for liberty-as-security, or civil liberty. [[Montesquieu]] used a similar argument.<ref name=\"Kettler, 1965\"/>\n\nSmith emphasized capital accumulation as the driver of growth, but Ferguson suggested innovation and technical advance were more important, and he is therefore in some ways more in line with modern thinking. According to Smith, commerce tends to make men 'dastardly'. This foreshadows a theme Ferguson, borrowing freely from Smith, took up to criticize capitalism.

Nevertheless, he certainly did well, becoming principal chaplain in 1746. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, when, disappointed at not obtaining a living, he left the clergy and resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits.\n\nAfter residing in [[Leipzig]] for a time, he returned to [[Edinburgh]] where in January 1757 he succeeded [[David Hume]] as librarian to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (see [[Advocates' Library]]), but soon relinquished this office on becoming tutor in the family of the [[Earl of Bute]].<ref name=\"Essay95\">{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Ferguson|editor=Fania Oz-Saltberger|title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society|url=https://archive.org/details/anessayonhistor00ferggoog|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-44736-4}}</ref>{{rp|xvi}} In 1759 Ferguson became professor of [[natural philosophy]] in the [[University of Edinburgh]], and in 1764 transferred to the chair of \"pneumatics\" ([[mental philosophy]]) \"and [[moral philosophy]]\".\n\nIn 1767, he published his ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'', which was well received and translated into several [[European languages]]. In the mid-1770s he travelled again to the [[European mainland|Continent]] and met [[Voltaire]]. His membership of [[The Poker Club]] is recorded in its minute book of 1776.\n\nIn 1776 appeared his anonymous pamphlet on the [[American Revolution]] in opposition to Dr [[Richard Price]]'s ''[[Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty]]'', in which he sympathised with the views of the [[British legislature]]. In 1778 Ferguson was appointed secretary to the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] which endeavoured, but without success, to negotiate an arrangement with the revolted colonies.\n\nIn 1780 he wrote the article \"History\" for the second edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]].<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204623/Adam-Ferguson</ref> The article is 40 pages long and replaced the article in the first edition, which was only one paragraph.\n\nIn 1783 appeared his ''[[History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic]]''; it became very popular and went through several editions. Ferguson believed that the [[history of the Roman Republic]] during the period of their greatness formed a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which he studied especially. The history reads well and impartially, and displays conscientious use of sources. The influence of the author's military experience shows itself in certain portions of the narrative. Tired of teaching, he resigned his professorship in 1785, and devoted himself to the revision of his lectures, which he published (1792) under the title of ''[[Principles of Moral and Political Science]]''.\n\nIn his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of the history, visited [[Italy]] and some of the principal cities of Europe, where he was received with honour by [[learned societies]]. From 1795 he resided successively at [[Neidpath Castle]] near [[Peebles]], at Hallyards on [[Manor Water]], and at [[St Andrews]], where he died on 22 February 1816.  He is buried in the churchyard of [[St Andrews Cathedral]], against the east wall. His large mural monument includes a carved profile portrait in marble.\n\n==Ethics==\nIn his [[ethical system]] Ferguson treats man as a social being, illustrating his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the [[human race]], he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. [[Victor Cousin]] criticised Ferguson's speculations (see his ''Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale an dix-huiti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'', pt. II., 1839\u20131840):\n\n<blockquote>We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above all his predecessors.</blockquote>\n\nBy this principle Ferguson attempted to reconcile all moral systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} With [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] he admits the power of self-interest or utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation. [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]'s theory of universal benevolence and [[Adam Smith]]'s idea of mutual sympathy (now [[empathy]]) he combines under the law of society. But, as these laws appear as the means rather than the end of human destiny, they remain subordinate to a supreme end, and the supreme end of perfection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn the political part of his system Ferguson follows [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and pleads the cause of well-regulated [[liberty]] and free [[government]]. His contemporaries, with the exception of Hume, regarded his writings as of great importance (see [[Sir Leslie Stephen]], ''English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 2011, p.&nbsp;214).\n\n==Social thought==\nFerguson's ''[[An Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' (1767) drew on classical authors and contemporary travel literature, to analyze modern commercial society with a critique of its abandonment of civic and communal virtues. Central themes in Ferguson's theory of citizenship are conflict, play, political participation and military valor. He emphasized the ability to put oneself in another's shoes, saying \"fellow-feeling\" was so much an \"appurtenance of human nature\" as to be a \"characteristic of the species.\"  Like his friends [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] as well as other Scottish intellectuals, he stressed the importance of the spontaneous order; that is, that coherent and even effective outcomes might result from the uncoordinated actions of many individuals.\n\nFerguson saw history as a two-tiered synthesis of natural history and social history, to which all humans belong. Natural history is created by [[God]]; so are humans, who are progressive. Social history is, in accordance with this natural progress, made by humans, and because of that factor it experiences occasional setbacks. But in general, humans are empowered by God to pursue progress in social history. Humans live not for themselves but for God's providential plan. He emphasized aspects of medieval [[chivalry]] as ideal [[masculine]] characteristics. British gentleman and young men were advised to dispense with aspects of politeness considered too [[feminine]], such as the constant desire to please, and to adopt less superficial qualities that suggested inner [[virtue]] and [[courtesy]] toward the 'fairer sex.'<ref name=\"Kettler, 1965\">Kettler, ''The Social and Political Thought of Adam Ferguson'' (1965)</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Herman, A., The Scottish Enlightenment, Harper Perennial</ref>\n\nFerguson was a leading advocate of the [[Idea of Progress]]. He believed that the growth of a commercial society through the pursuit of individual self-interest could promote a self-sustaining progress. Yet paradoxically Ferguson also believed that such commercial growth could foster a decline in virtue and thus ultimately lead to a collapse similar to Rome's. Ferguson, a devout [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]], resolved the apparent paradox by placing both developments in the context of a divinely ordained plan that mandated both progress and human free will. For Ferguson, the knowledge that humanity gains through its actions, even those actions resulting in temporary retrogression, form an intrinsic part of its progressive, asymptotic movement toward an ultimately unobtainable perfectibility.<ref>Hill (1997)</ref>\n\nFerguson was influenced by classical humanism and such writers as [[Tacitus]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The fellow members of Edinburgh's Select Society, which included [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], were also major influences. Ferguson believed that civilization is largely about laws that restrict our independence as individuals but provide liberty in the sense of security and justice. He warned that social chaos usually leads to despotism. The members of civil society give up their liberty-as-autonomy, which savages possess, in exchange for liberty-as-security, or civil liberty. [[Montesquieu]] used a similar argument.<ref name=\"Kettler, 1965\"/>\n\nSmith emphasized capital accumulation as the driver of growth, but Ferguson suggested innovation and technical advance were more important, and he is therefore in some ways more in line with modern thinking. According to Smith, commerce tends to make men 'dastardly'. This foreshadows a theme Ferguson, borrowing freely from Smith, took up to criticize capitalism.  Ferguson's critique of commercial society went far beyond that of Smith, and influenced [[Hegel]] and Marx.<ref name=\"Kettler, 1965\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe ''Essay'' has been seen as an innovative attempt to reclaim the tradition of [[Civic republicanism|civic republican]] citizenship in modern Britain, and an influence on the ideas of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] held by the [[American Founding Fathers]].<ref name=\"Kettler, 1965\"/>\n\n==Family==\nHe married Katharine Burnett in 1767.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of The Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> Ferguson was first cousin, close friend and colleague to [[Joseph Black|Joseph Black M.D ]] and Katie Burnett was Black's niece.<ref>Records of the Clan and Name Ferguson 1895 page.138 note. 1 accessed 22 December 2018</ref> They produced seven children the eldest [[Adam Ferguson (British Army officer)]] close friend to Sir Walter Scott, followed by James, Joseph, John, Isabella, Mary and Margaret.<ref>Records of the clan and name of Fergusson by D Douglas 1895 P.144</ref>\n\n==Main works==\n* ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-04uAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=adam+ferguson#v=onepage&q=&f=false An Essay on the History of Civil Society]'' (1767)\n** Reprinted in 1995 with a new introduction by Louis Schneider.

It is situated at the junction of the two sections of the A5089, on the [[Trans Pennine Trail]]. It is a single-sex school, with girls attending between the ages of 11\u201318.\n\n== History ==\nThe school opened in 1844 as a boarding school on Great George's Square, offering instruction in Geography, use of globes, Botany, History, Writing, Arithmetic, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] [[languages]]. After 52 years the school was moved to Princes Park<ref name=\"BelleriveWebsite\"/> in 1887. The values of the FCJ charism are central to all that takes place in the school. These values include, Companionship, Dignity, Excellence, Justice, Gentleness and Hope.\n\n===Direct grant grammar school===\nLike several single-sex catholic secondary schools in Liverpool it was a [[direct grant grammar school]], the '''Bellerive Girls' School''', commonly known as Bellerive Convent Grammar School, from 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1946/may/31/grammar-schools-direct-grant-status|title=GRAMMAR SCHOOLS (DIRECT GRANT STATUS) (Hansard, 31 May 1946)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}</ref> It is now a single institution spanning both sides of Ullet Road, connected by a private subway and it is called Bellerive FCJ Catholic College. Another catholic girls' direct grant grammar school in Liverpool was the Notre Dame Collegiate School, now the [[Notre Dame Catholic College (Liverpool)|Notre Dame Catholic College]].\n\nThe school had boarding facilities until 1961. In the 1970s the headteacher was Sister Mary Gabriel.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nIt became a comprehensive in 1983, becoming the upper school of St Mary's RC High School. The lower school was at the former St Margaret Clitherow school.\n\nIn 1997 it became known as Bellerive Convent FCJ, later Bellerive Catholic High School FCJ. Today it is known as Bellerive FCJ Catholic College. It gained Science College status in 2003, and Maths and Computing College status in 2007.\n\nSister Brigid Halligan received the OBE in the [[2008 New Year Honours]]. Sr Brigid retired as Headteacher in August 2017 and has been replaced by Mrs N Howlett MSc NPQH.\n\nIn 2016, Bellerive was confirmed as a good school following an Ofsted inspection. An Archdiocese of Liverpool Section 48 inspection in June 2017 concluded that Bellerive was an outstanding provider of Catholic education A number of new buildings were opened in 2016-17, including the Sefton Park building( housing the sixth form, Music, Performing Arts and Humanities. The main performance space has been named the Loyola Hall in honour of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus ( Jesuits).  The FCJ sisters share a common Ignatian spirituality with other religious communities.\n\nThe O'Neill building ( housing Design Technology, Art and Science) was opened by Bishop Tom Williams in April 2018.  The O'Neill building has been named in honour of Mother Xavier O'Neill fcJ who died in the 1840s working with the poor of Liverpool in St.Patrick's parish.\n\nConstruction of a new sports hall commenced in 2017, on the site of the schools tennis courts. Work on this building is scheduled to be completed by August 2018. In September 2017, Bellerive became the base for the Resonate Music Service's south Liverpool hub.\n\n===Academy===\nThe school became an academy in August 2012, and is no longer under local authority control.
