The legs are straight and the energy is different with much more body tension in Urban Kiz. The figures made often also require movement along straight lines or changing direction only at perpendicular angles or reversing direction. Pivots and pirouettes of the lady are also more common in Urban Kiz than in Kizomba, although they did appear in Kizomba and especially in [[Semba]] (Kizomba was derived mainly from Semba influences), but not as much, since the chest-to-chest frame did not allow for it as much.

McGarry also sold Aboriginal artefacts and weapons that were made at the mission.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nIn April 1938 teaching duties were taken from McGarry, who had been teaching for three hours every day, when the Sisters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart took over the running of the school. McGarry found this transition very difficult and tried to maintain influence over the school; causing considerable tension with the sisters and the missionary community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1942, following the [[bombing of Darwin]], Alice Springs became a major army staging base and the mission was ordered to relocate to [[Arltunga Historical Reserve|Arltunga]], 110 km (68 miles) east of Alice Springs, which was, at this time, a former mining town. To complete this move, which took two years, McGarry was responsible for looking for water, building roads and escorting people to the new location. However, when the move was completed in March 1944<ref name=\":1\" /> McGarry was told that his services were no longer required; the reason for this is not clear but it is suggested that it was due to McGarry's poor relationship with the sisters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Career with the Native Affairs Branch ===\nIn September 1944 McGarry accepted a position with the Northern Territory's Native Affairs Branch, initially as a patrol officer;<ref name=\":1\" /> a position that he had been offered earlier. In 1946, after a number of more short-term roles, McGarry was posted as superintendent of the newly established [[Yuendumu|Yuendumu settlement]], delivering rations and welfare services to [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]]  and [[Anmatyerre]] people who had been displaced from their homelands and traditional food sources.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis position was, however, short-lived with McGarry being asked to step down from the role in 1948 (although he was told that he could apply for the role of the assistant). This may have been due to enforcement of the policy that only married men could be employed as superintendent or that McGarry's attitude to the arrival of [[Baptists|Baptist]] missionaries was problematic.

McGarry worked alongside local [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] men to build the mission here<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://misacor.org.au/index.php/emagazine/current-news/201-reappraising-aspects-of-mission-activity|title=REAPPRAISING ASPECTS OF MISSION ACTIVITY|last=MALONE|first=Peter|website=misacor.org.au|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findandconnect.gov.au/guide/nt/YE00025|title=Little Flower Mission - Summary {{!}} Find & Connect|website=www.findandconnect.gov.au|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>; this included erecting combined church and school and [[Wurlie|Wurlies]], a form of humpies, for accommodating families.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nDuring this period McGarry fed, clothed and taught Aboriginal children at the mission and he is remembered for not allowing the children to speak their [[Arrernte language]] and his belief that he was working quietly towards the elimination of adherence to Arrernte cultural practices, believing that they conflicted with his Christianity. <ref name=\":2\" /> Examples of this is that McGarry expelled men and women found to be in [[Polygamy|polygamous relationships]] from the mission camp and believed that boys initiation rites, men's business, were excessively brutal and that the process made it more difficult for them to accept Christianity. McGarry wrote in a letter to his family that<ref name=\":0\" />:\n\n{{Block quote|text=\u201cCorroborees contrary to the Church will die\nout in time. However...I am trying to make it a quick process.\u201d|author=Francis McGarry|title=|source=Letter from Francis McGarry to the McGarry family, 25 July 1938, McGarry Papers.}}\n\nThis resistance and rejection of cultural practices was in direct contradiction to the advice of [[Charles Duguid]], who inspired the mission after sharing his condemnation of the way that Aboriginal people were treated in Alice Springs following a visit there in 1934: Duguid encouraged missionaries to respect local language and culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://misacor.org.au/index.php/emagazine/current-news/201-reappraising-aspects-of-mission-activity|title=REAPPRAISING ASPECTS OF MISSION ACTIVITY|last=MALONE|first=Peter|website=misacor.org.au|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> \n\nIn these early years McGarry also obtained most of the mission's food by seeking donations and bargaining for goods in  Alice Springs as well as from family and the St Vincent de Paul Society.  McGarry also sold Aboriginal artefacts and weapons that were made at the mission.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nIn April 1938 teaching duties were taken from McGarry, who had been teaching for three hours every day, when the Sisters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart took over the running of the school. McGarry found this transition very difficult and tried to maintain influence over the school; causing considerable tension with the sisters and the missionary community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1942, following the [[bombing of Darwin]], Alice Springs became a major army staging base and the mission was ordered to relocate to [[Arltunga Historical Reserve|Arltunga]], 110 km (68 miles) east of Alice Springs, which was, at this time, a former mining town. To complete this move, which took two years, McGarry was responsible for looking for water, building roads and escorting people to the new location. However, when the move was completed in March 1944<ref name=\":1\" /> McGarry was told that his services were no longer required; the reason for this is not clear but it is suggested that it was due to McGarry's poor relationship with the sisters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Career with the Native Affairs Branch ===\nIn September 1944 McGarry accepted a position with the Northern Territory's Native Affairs Branch, initially as a patrol officer;<ref name=\":1\" /> a position that he had been offered earlier. In 1946, after a number of more short-term roles, McGarry was posted as superintendent of the newly established [[Yuendumu|Yuendumu settlement]], delivering rations and welfare services to [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]]  and [[Anmatyerre]] people who had been displaced from their homelands and traditional food sources.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis position was, however, short-lived with McGarry being asked to step down from the role in 1948 (although he was told that he could apply for the role of the assistant). This may have been due to enforcement of the policy that only married men could be employed as superintendent or that McGarry's attitude to the arrival of [[Baptists|Baptist]] missionaries was problematic. McGarry did write in a letter home that<ref name=\":0\" />: \n{{Quote|text=They will put no one over me, so ...
