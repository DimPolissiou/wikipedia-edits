The choir was simply the east part of the nave, and was fenced off by a screen or low railing, called ''cancelli'', which is where the English word [[chancel]] comes from. The development of the architectural feature known as the choir is the result of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] development brought about by the end of persecutions under [[Constantine the Great]] and the rise of [[monasticism]]. The word \"choir\" is first used by members of the [[Latin Church]]. [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Honorius of Autun]] write that the term is derived from the \"corona\", the circle of clergy or singers who surrounded the altar.\n\nWhen first introduced, the choir was attached to the [[Bema#Christianity|bema]], the elevated platform in the center of the nave on which were placed seats for the higher clergy and a [[lectern]] for scripture readings. This arrangement can still be observed at the [[Basilica]] of [[St. Mary Major]] in Rome. Over time, the bema (or [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]]) and choir moved eastward to their current position. In some churches, such as [[Westminster Cathedral]], the choir is arranged in the [[apse]] behind the [[altar]].\n\nThe architectural details of the choir developed in response to its function as the place where the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] was chanted by the monastic brotherhood or the [[chapter house|chapter]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]]. The chancel was regarded as the clergy's part of the church, and any choirboys from a choir school counted as part of the clergy for this purpose. After the Reformation, when the number of clergy present even in large churches and cathedrals tended to reduce, and lay singing choirs became more frequent, there were often objections to placing them in the traditional choir stalls in the chancel. The [[pulpit]] and [[lectern]] are also usually found at the front of the choir, though both Catholic and Protestant churches have sometimes moved the pulpit to the nave for better audibility. The [[organ (instrument)|organ]] may be located here, or in a loft elsewhere in the church. Some [[cathedral]]s have a retro-choir behind the High Altar, opening eastward towards the [[chapel]]s ([[chantry|chantries]]) in the eastern extremity.\n\nAfter the Reformation Protestant churches generally moved the altar (now often called the [[communion table]]) forward, typically to the front of the chancel, and often used lay choirs who were placed in a gallery at the west end. The choir and rear of deep chancels became little used in churches surviving from the Middle Ages, and new churches very often omitted one. With the emphasis on sermons, and their audibility, some churches simply converted their chancels to seat part of the congregation. In 19th-century England one of the battles of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], the architectural wing of the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s in the [[Church of England]], was to restore the chancel, including the choir, as a necessary part of a church. By pushing the altar back to its medieval position and having the choir used by a lay choir, they were largely successful in this, although the harder end of the [[High Church]] objected to allowing a large group of laity into the chancel.<ref>White, James F., ''The Cambridge Movement: The Ecclesiologists and the Gothic Revival'', 93\u201397, 1962 (2004 reprint), Wipf and Stock Publishers, {{ISBN|1592449379}}, 9781592449378, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zDhLAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA94 google books]</ref> Different approaches to worship in the 20th century again tended to push altars in larger churches forward, to be closer to the congregation, and the chancel again risks being a less used area of the church.\n\n==Seating==\n[[Image:Stalles.eglise.Anellau.png|thumb|Illustration showing monk's stalls at Anellau, France, 14th century]]\nThe choir area is occupied by sometimes finely carved and decorated wooden seats known as ''choir stalls'', where the clergy sit, stand or kneel during services. The choir may be furnished either with long benches ([[pew]]s) or individual choir stalls. There may be several rows of seating running parallel to the walls of the church.\n\nThe use of choir stalls (as opposed to benches) is more traditional in [[monasteries]] and [[collegiate church]]es. Monastic choir stalls are often fitted with seats that fold up when the [[Monasticism|monastics]] stand and fold down when they sit. Often the hinged seat will have a [[misericord]] (small wooden seat) on the underside on which he can lean while standing during the long services. The upper part of the monk's stall is so shaped as to provide a headrest while sitting, and arm rests when standing. Monasteries will often have strict rules as to when the monastics may sit and when they must stand during the services.\n\nChoir benches are more common in [[parish church]]es. Each bench may have padded [[kneeler]]s attached to the back of it so that the person behind may kneel at the appropriate times during services. The front row will often have a long [[prie-dieu]] running in front of it for the choir members to place their books on, and which may also be fitted with kneelers.\n\nIn a cathedral, the bishop's throne or ''[[cathedra]]'' is usually located in this space.<ref>{{cite CE1913|last=Gietmann |first=Gerhard |wstitle=Stallsr |volume=14}}</ref>\n\n==Image gallery==\n{{gallery\n|height=140\n|lines=3\n|Image:Boston Stump misericord 02.JPG|Choir stalls at [[Boston Stump]], [[Lincolnshire]].
