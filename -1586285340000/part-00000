The order includes more than 1,000 described [[species]] in about 153 [[genus|genera]]. Despite the common names, they are neither true [[scorpion]]s (order Scorpiones) nor true [[spider]]s (order [[Araneae]]). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]: an [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen) behind the [[prosoma]] (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two [[chelicerae]] that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for [[stridulation]]. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a \"tail\". Most species of Solifugae live in [[dry climate]]s and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling [[arthropod]]s and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Solifugae Ventral aspect of respiratory slots 2012 01 24 0985s.JPG|thumb|Ventral aspect of a solifugid, showing respiratory slots]]\nSolifugae are moderately small to large arachnids (a few millimeters to several centimeters in body length), with the larger species reaching {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, including legs.<ref name=\"geographic\">{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/egyptian-giant-solpugid/ |title=Egyptian giant solpugid (camel spider) ''Galeodes arabs'' |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref><ref name=schmidt93/> In practice, the respective lengths of the legs of various species differ drastically, so the resulting figures are often misleading.

As shown in the illustrations, the solifugid prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or \"[[Pedicel (spider)|pedicel]]\" as occurs in \"true spiders\", the order Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between the Solifugae and spiders, namely that solifugids lack both spinnerets and [[Spider silk|silk]], and do not spin [[Spiderweb|webs]]. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the Solifugae have no need for any such adaptation.\n\nThe prosoma comprises the head, the mouthparts, and the [[somite]]s that bear the legs and the [[pedipalps]]. The alternative name \"cephalothorax\" reflects the fact that the prosoma includes the parts that in insects form the head plus the thorax. Though it is not split into two clear tagmata, the prosoma does have a large, relatively well-defined anterior carapace, bearing the animal's eyes and chelicerae, while a smaller posterior section bears the legs.<ref name=\"Punzo\"/><ref name=IZ>{{Cite book|author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 613\u2013614|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\nLike [[pseudoscorpion]]s and [[harvestmen]], the Solifugae lack [[book lung]]s, having instead a well-developed [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] that inhales and exhales air through a number of spiracles; one pair between the second and third pair of walking legs, two pairs on the abdomen on abdominal segments three and four, and an unpaired spiracle on the fifth abdominal segment.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=x7vtCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&dq=%22To+the+primary+paired+spiracles+in+opisthosoma+segments+3+and+4%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhi7jbtJnlAhUEuIsKHRP7C2EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22To%20the%20primary%20paired%20spiracles%20in%20opisthosoma%20segments%203%20and%204%22&f=false Multicellular Animals: Volume II: The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa]</ref>\n\n===Chelicerae===\n[[File:Solifugae Chelicera lateral aspect 2012 01 24 0999s.JPG|thumb|Lateral aspect of chelicera, showing teeth and cutting edge]]\nAmong the most distinctive features of the Solifugae are their large [[chelicerae]], which in many species are longer than the prosoma.

The pedipalps of the Solifugae function partly as sense organs similar to insects' [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], and partly in locomotion, feeding, and fighting. In normal locomotion, they do not quite touch the ground, but are held out to detect obstacles and prey; in that attitude, they look particularly like an extra pair of legs or perhaps arms. Reflecting the great dependence of the Solifugae on their tactile senses, their [[anterior]] true legs commonly are smaller and thinner than the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] three pairs. That smaller anterior pair acts largely in a sensory role as a supplement to the pedipalps, and in many species they accordingly lack tarsi. At the tips of their pedipalps, Solifugae bear [[:wikt:evert|eversible]] adhesive organs, which they may use to capture flying prey, and which at least some species certainly use for climbing smooth surfaces.<ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\" /><ref name=\"CNH\">Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 4, Crustacea, Trilobites, Arachnida, Tardigrada, Pentastomida etc. Macmillan Company 1895</ref>\n[[File:Solifugae Solpugidae showing malleoli 2012 01 24 0964s.JPG|thumb|A female of a species in the family Solpugidae showing the malleoli beneath the posterior pair of legs]]\n\nFor the most part, only the posterior three pairs of legs are used for running.<ref name=IZ/><ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\"/> On the undersides of the coxae and trochanters of the last pair of legs, Solifugae have fan-shaped sensory organs called [[malleolus (arthropod)|malleoli]] or racquet (or racket) organs.

As shown in the illustrations, the solifugid prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or \"[[Pedicel (spider)|pedicel]]\" as occurs in \"true spiders\", the order Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between the Solifugae and spiders, namely that solifugids lack both spinnerets and [[Spider silk|silk]], and do not spin [[Spiderweb|webs]]. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the Solifugae have no need for any such adaptation.\n\nThe prosoma comprises the head, the mouthparts, and the [[somite]]s that bear the legs and the [[pedipalps]]. The alternative name \"cephalothorax\" reflects the fact that the prosoma includes the parts that in insects form the head plus the thorax. Though it is not split into two clear tagmata, the prosoma does have a large, relatively well-defined anterior carapace, bearing the animal's eyes and chelicerae, while a smaller posterior section bears the legs.<ref name=\"Punzo\"/><ref name=IZ>{{Cite book|author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 613\u2013614|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\nLike [[pseudoscorpion]]s and [[harvestmen]], the Solifugae lack [[book lung]]s, having instead a well-developed [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] that inhales and exhales air through a number of spiracles; one pair between the second and third pair of walking legs, two pairs on the abdomen on abdominal segments three and four, and an unpaired spiracle on the fifth abdominal segment.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=x7vtCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&dq=%22To+the+primary+paired+spiracles+in+opisthosoma+segments+3+and+4%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhi7jbtJnlAhUEuIsKHRP7C2EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22To%20the%20primary%20paired%20spiracles%20in%20opisthosoma%20segments%203%20and%204%22&f=false Multicellular Animals: Volume II: The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa]</ref>\n\n===Chelicerae===\n[[File:Solifugae Chelicera lateral aspect 2012 01 24 0999s.JPG|thumb|Lateral aspect of chelicera, showing teeth and cutting edge]]\nAmong the most distinctive features of the Solifugae are their large [[chelicerae]], which in many species are longer than the prosoma.

The pedipalps of the Solifugae function partly as sense organs similar to insects' [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], and partly in locomotion, feeding, and fighting. In normal locomotion, they do not quite touch the ground, but are held out to detect obstacles and prey; in that attitude, they look particularly like an extra pair of legs or perhaps arms. Reflecting the great dependence of the Solifugae on their tactile senses, their [[anterior]] true legs commonly are smaller and thinner than the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] three pairs. That smaller anterior pair acts largely in a sensory role as a supplement to the pedipalps, and in many species they accordingly lack tarsi. At the tips of their pedipalps, Solifugae bear [[:wikt:evert|eversible]] adhesive organs, which they may use to capture flying prey, and which at least some species certainly use for climbing smooth surfaces.<ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\" /><ref name=\"CNH\">Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 4, Crustacea, Trilobites, Arachnida, Tardigrada, Pentastomida etc. Macmillan Company 1895</ref>\n[[File:Solifugae Solpugidae showing malleoli 2012 01 24 0964s.JPG|thumb|A female of a species in the family Solpugidae showing the malleoli beneath the posterior pair of legs]]\n\nFor the most part, only the posterior three pairs of legs are used for running.<ref name=IZ/><ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\"/> On the undersides of the coxae and trochanters of the last pair of legs, Solifugae have fan-shaped sensory organs called [[malleolus (arthropod)|malleoli]] or racquet (or racket) organs.

The city has been plagued by a series of brutal, ritualistic child murders. The first victim is a young boy found murdered in an abandoned movie theater. A man named Tom Lopez frantically phones in the discovery of the body, and claims the crimes are being committed by members of an Hispanic cult practicing a malevolent version of [[brujer\u00eda]]. Cal is appointed to examine Tom, who raves about the cult's powerful leader.\n\nA second victim is found eviscerated on a makeshift altar beneath a dock in [[Staten Island]]. Cal begins to inquire about brujer\u00eda to Carmen, his housekeeper and nanny, who practices a benevolent form of it, leaving protection charms in the apartment for Cal and Chris. The following day, Tom, paranoid and being followed by mysterious men, stabs himself to death in a diner. Later, Cal and his new girlfriend, Jessica, attend a party where a mysterious Caribbean man, Palo, attempts to steal a necklace from Jessica; shortly before, Jessica had left her compact in the bathroom, which became subject to a [[curse]] by Palo. When Cal returns home, he finds Carmen performing a ritual on Chris, and angrily throws her out of the house, despite the fact that she assures him she is attempting to protect him.\n\nChris accompanies his affluent Aunt Kate and Uncle Dennis on a trip to stay at their country home. Meanwhile, Cal and Jessica consult Oscar Sezine, a friend of Tom's, who believes the cult is planning a ritualized murder for the [[summer solstice]] four days away. Oscar performs a [[ritual purification|purification ritual]] in an attempt to ensure safety of Chris, whom he worries may be targeted as a [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] for the solstice. The next morning, Jessica finds a [[boil]] on her face and falls ill. Before departing to reunite with Kate, Dennis, and Chris in the country, Cal receives a frantic phone call from police lieutenant Sean McTaggert. Cal arrives at McTaggert's apartment, finding it in disarray, and McTaggert seated with a gun, rambling in a paranoid manner. He shows Cal a photo and secret file he uncovered documenting elite businessman Robert Calder's ritual murder of his own son.\n\nCal leaves with the file at McTaggert's insistence. After he leaves, McTaggert commits suicide. Meanwhile, Jessica has a [[panic attack]] after the boil on her face bursts, revealing baby spiders\u2014a spider has apparently laid eggs in her skin. While Cal tends to Jessica in the hospital, Kate leaves him a voice message that she has changed her plans and is going to return Chris to him, but the message is cut short. Unaware Kate has called, Cal departs the hospital with his friend Marty, who drives him to Kate and Dennis's country house. Upon arriving, Dennis tells Cal Kate has gone to a 24-hour grocery store. In the living room, Dennis recounts he and Kate's travels to the Caribbean when Kate was a [[graduate student]], and how they witnessed the power of a human sacrifice. Palo and Colburn then enter the room, along with a number of other cultists, urging Cal to join, and stating that Chris has been predestined to become a sacrifice.\n\nCal flees the house through an upstairs window after finding Chris no longer in his room. In the boathouse, Cal finds Kate's dead body before he is knocked unconscious by Palo. Cal is driven to an abandoned warehouse, where Chris's ritual murder is to be carried out among the cult. Cal thwarts the sacrifice by stabbing Dennis to death, and Marty, who followed them to the warehouse, comes to Cal's aid, shooting various cultists to death from an upper landing. Colburn abducts Chris and the two ascend to the top of the warehouse in a freight elevator. Marty is incapacitated with a blowpipe dart by Palo, but not before he severely burns Palo's face, blinding him. Cal manages to chase Colburn into a storage room, stabbing him to death before retrieving Chris.

Citing as examples ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Omen (film series)|The Omen]]'' film series (1976-1991). But he also noted that Hollywood seemed to have lost interest in the subject by the 1980s. He cites ''The Believers'' as one of only two noteworthy films about [[Theistic Satanism|Devil worship]] created in the 1980s, the other one being ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987). Though he notes that ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984) also touched on the similar subject of a demon-worshiping cult, which abducts children and offers [[human sacrifice]]s.<ref name=\"Donovan\">Donovan (2011), p. 129-130</ref>\n\nHe points out that ''Angel Heart'' was a [[period piece]] set in the 1940s, and so fantastic that it limited its connections to the contemporary world of the 1980s \"and its fundamentalist [[paranoia]]s\", while ''The Believers'' was set in that contemporary world. The villains were not, however, worshipers of the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Satan]]. Instead they were practitioners of [[Santer\u00eda]], the legitimate [[Afro-Caribbean]] religion depicted in the film as \"a cult of evil that condones human sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Donovan\"/> Neither film approached the subject of the 1980s hysteria over [[Satanic ritual abuse]], a [[conspiracy theory]] which generated [[Sensationalism|sensationalist headlines]] in this decade. Donovan concludes that Hollywood distanced itself from the subject matter, probably because [[child sexual abuse]] was deemed an unfit subject for popcorn entertainment.<ref name=\"Donovan\"/>\n\nAccording to [[John Kenneth Muir]], the message of the film is that [[yuppie]]s would do anything for success, including calling upon dark gods.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> Muir points similarities to ''[[The Possession of Joel Delaney]]'' (1972), as both films fear ethnicity. For example, in ''The Believers'', a cleaning woman working for the Jamisons tries to protect Chris by using a benevolent version of Santeria. Cal fails to distinguish between good and evil magic and treats her as a threat.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> The film depicts [[Manhattan]] as a place where alien cultures merge and the Christian white man has reasons to fear the pagans, who may come for his children. As such, it plays on a fear for the ethnic, racial, and religious [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] complained that most films about Caribbean religions tend to involve \"guys with blank eyes\" and [[animal sacrifice]], bloodthirsty cults, sadistic killers, and a quest for innocent blood; they never depict any positive aspect to these religions. He found this to be a prejudiced treatment.<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2000), p. 36-38</ref>  He also complained that the film makes use of multiple ritualistic details (such as circles of ashes, blood, and charms), without ever bothering to explain their meaning.<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2000), p. 36-38</ref> According to Mercedes Cros Sandoval, the film brought both public attention and negative publicity for [[Santer\u00eda]].<ref name=\"Sandoval\">Sandoval (2008), p. 366</ref>\n\nThe film is more typical of its decade in the negative depiction of the [[upper class]] of New York City. The cultists turn out to be members of this social class which literally sacrifice their children in exchange for \"fame, wealth, and power\". Their success and [[Social mobility|upward mobility]] is based not on business acumen, but their practice of Santeria. Muir sees this as a literal interpretation of a familiar phrase, [[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]].<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref> \nMuir notes a few similarities with ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968). An evil cult is depicted as active in a modern city, hiding in plain sight. And a couple of [[limousine liberal]] friends of the Jamisons are revealed to be cultists in their own right.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\nFor Muir, the highlight of the film involves the depiction of a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]]-like [[curse]]. Jessica Halliday ([[Helen Shaver]]) accidentally leaves her [[Compact (cosmetics)|compact]] in a bathroom while snooping around in Calder's office. By the time she retrieves it, it has become a cursed item. While using it, something \"gets under her beautiful skin\". It manifests as a [[boil]], which gets progressively redder and more inflamed. Finally it swells to capacity, and spiders start emerging from the boil's interior.<ref name=\"Muir\">Muir (2007), p. 558-559</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\n===Controversy===\n''The Believers'' was shown to have influenced the [[Santer\u00eda]]-based cult established by [[Adolfo Constanzo]] and supported by [[Sara Aldrete]] in [[Matamoros, Mexico]].<ref name=\"RS\">Rolling Stone (1989), p. 35-36</ref> \n\n===Critical response===\n{{expand section|date=March 2019}}\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Believers'' holds an approval rating of 35%, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 4.85/10.<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web |title=The Believers (1987) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_believers_1987 |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>  \n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one and a half stars out of 4, denouncing the film as \"an awesomely silly, tasteless, and half-witted movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert87\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=The Believers Movie Review & Film Summary (1987) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-believers-1987 |website=Roger Ebert.com |publisher=Roger Ebert |accessdate=28 February 2019}}</ref> Dennis Schwartz' from ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'' awarded the film a grade C+, calling the film \"muddled\", and criticized the film's cheap scares, writing, and lack of a believable storyline.<ref name=\"schwartz17\">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=believers |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/believers.html |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all reviews of the film were negative.\nHal Hinson from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film a mostly positive review, writing, \"''The Believers'' is a bizarre, occult thriller about the implications of religious faith.

It is based on the 1982 novel ''[[The Religion]]'' by [[Nicholas Conde]].{{sfn|Muir|2007|pages=558-559}}\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his wife, Lisa, dies in a freak accident, psychologist Cal Jamison relocates with his young son, Chris, from [[Minneapolis]] to [[New York City]], where Cal begins working as a [[police psychology|police psychologist]] for the [[New York City Police Department]]. The city has been plagued by a series of brutal, ritualistic child murders. The first victim is a young boy found murdered in an abandoned movie theater. A man named Tom Lopez frantically phones in the discovery of the body, and claims the crimes are being committed by members of an Hispanic cult practicing a malevolent version of [[brujer\u00eda]]. Cal is appointed to examine Tom, who raves about the cult's powerful leader.\n\nA second victim is found eviscerated on a makeshift altar beneath a dock in [[Staten Island]]. Cal begins to inquire about brujer\u00eda to Carmen, his housekeeper and nanny, who practices a benevolent form of it, leaving protection charms in the apartment for Cal and Chris. The following day, Tom, paranoid and being followed by mysterious men, stabs himself to death in a diner. Later, Cal and his new girlfriend, Jessica, attend a party where a mysterious Caribbean man, Palo, attempts to steal a necklace from Jessica; shortly before, Jessica had left her compact in the bathroom, which became subject to a [[curse]] by Palo. When Cal returns home, he finds Carmen performing a ritual on Chris, and angrily throws her out of the house, despite the fact that she assures him she is attempting to protect him.\n\nChris accompanies his affluent Aunt Kate and Uncle Dennis on a trip to stay at their country home. Meanwhile, Cal and Jessica consult Oscar Sezine, a friend of Tom's, who believes the cult is planning a ritualized murder for the [[summer solstice]] four days away. Oscar performs a [[ritual purification|purification ritual]] in an attempt to ensure safety of Chris, whom he worries may be targeted as a [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] for the solstice. The next morning, Jessica finds a [[boil]] on her face and falls ill. Before departing to reunite with Kate, Dennis, and Chris in the country, Cal receives a frantic phone call from police lieutenant Sean McTaggert. Cal arrives at McTaggert's apartment, finding it in disarray, and McTaggert seated with a gun, rambling in a paranoid manner. He shows Cal a photo and secret file he uncovered documenting elite businessman Robert Calder's ritual murder of his own son.\n\nCal leaves with the file at McTaggert's insistence. After he leaves, McTaggert commits suicide. Meanwhile, Jessica has a [[panic attack]] after the boil on her face bursts, revealing baby spiders\u2014a spider has apparently laid eggs in her skin. While Cal tends to Jessica in the hospital, Kate leaves him a voice message that she has changed her plans and is going to return Chris to him, but the message is cut short. Unaware Kate has called, Cal departs the hospital with his friend Marty, who drives him to Kate and Dennis's country house. Upon arriving, Dennis tells Cal Kate has gone to a 24-hour grocery store. In the living room, Dennis recounts he and Kate's travels to the Caribbean when Kate was a [[graduate student]], and how they witnessed the power of a human sacrifice. Palo and Colburn then enter the room, along with a number of other cultists, urging Cal to join, and stating that Chris has been predestined to become a sacrifice.\n\nCal flees the house through an upstairs window after finding Chris no longer in his room. In the boathouse, Cal finds Kate's dead body before he is knocked unconscious by Palo. Cal is driven to an abandoned warehouse, where Chris's ritual murder is to be carried out among the cult. Cal thwarts the sacrifice by stabbing Dennis to death, and Marty, who followed them to the warehouse, comes to Cal's aid, shooting various cultists to death from an upper landing. Colburn abducts Chris and the two ascend to the top of the warehouse in a freight elevator. Marty is incapacitated with a blowpipe dart by Palo, but not before he severely burns Palo's face, blinding him. Cal manages to chase Colburn into a storage room, stabbing him to death before retrieving Chris. A blinded Palo attacks Cal, but falls off the scaffolding when Chris coaxes him toward him, and is impaled to death below.\n\nSome time later, Cal, Jessica, and Chris go to vacation at a farmhouse. In the barn loft, Cal finds a shrine adorned with various sacrificed animals. He is approached by Jessica from below, who admits responsibility, telling him they will \"be safe now.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Cal Jamison\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Jessica Halliday\n* [[Harley Cross]] as Chris Jamison\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Lieutenant Sean McTaggert\n* [[Jimmy Smits]] as Tom Lopez\n* Malick Bowens as Palo\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Kate Maslow\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Robert Calder\n* [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] as Dennis Maslow\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Marty Wertheimer\n* Carla Pinza as Carmen Ruiz\n* [[Janet-Laine Green]] as Lisa Jamison\n* [[Ra\u00fal D\u00e1vila]] as Oscar Sezine\n* Geoffrey Kellett as Paramedic\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nBarna William Donovan notes that there were several Satanic-themed Hollywood films in the 1970s.

Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground to the building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water (typically starting at {{convert|10|-|12|C|F|disp=or}}) as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures.<ref name=\"heatpumps9-4\">[[Dharendra Yogi Goswami|Goswami, Yogi D.]], [[Frank Kreith|Kreith, Frank]], Johnson, Katherine (2008), p. 9-4.</ref> In contrast, an [[air-source heat pump]] draws heat from the air (colder outside air) and thus requires more energy.\n\nGround source heat pumps (GSHPs) are ''not'' geothermal, i.e. there is no geyser providing heat to be captured. A GSHP merely accesses stored solar heat energy in the soil or rock.  GSHPs circulate a carrier fluid (usually a mixture of water and small amounts of antifreeze) through closed pipe loops buried in the ground. Single-home systems can be \"vertical loop field\" systems with bore holes {{convert|50|-|400|ft|m|sigfig=2}} deep <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/wells/geothermal.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203060622/http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/wells/geothermal.html |archive-date=2014-02-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> or, if adequate land is available for extensive trenches, a \"horizontal loop field\" is installed approximately six feet subsurface. As the fluid circulates underground it absorbs heat from the ground and, on its return, the warmed fluid passes through the heat pump which uses electricity to extract heat from the fluid. The re-chilled fluid is sent back into the ground thus continuing the cycle. The heat extracted and that generated by the heat pump appliance as a byproduct is used to heat the house. The addition of the ground heating loop in the energy equation means that significantly more heat can be transferred to a building than if electricity alone had been used directly for heating.\n\nSwitching the direction of heat flow, the same system can be used to circulate the cooled water through the house for cooling in the summer months. The heat is exhausted to the relatively cooler ground (or groundwater) rather than delivering it to the hot outside air as an air conditioner does. As a result, the heat is pumped across a larger temperature difference and this leads to higher efficiency and lower energy use.<ref name=\"heatpumps9-4\"/>\n\nThis technology makes ground source heating economically viable in any geographical location. In 2004, an estimated million ground-source heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW extracted 88 PJ of heat energy for space heating. Global ground-source heat pump capacity is growing by 10% annually.<ref name=\"IPCC\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Oldest geothermal.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest known pool fed by a hot spring, built in the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century BC.]]\n\n[[Hot springs]] have been used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Cataldi | first = Raffaele | date =August 1993 | title =Review of historiographic aspects of geothermal energy in the Mediterranean and Mesoamerican areas prior to the Modern Age | journal =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | volume =15 | issue =1 | pages = 13\u201316 | url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/bulletin/bi046.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-11-01}}</ref> The oldest known spa is a stone pool on [[China]]'s [[Mount Li]] built in the [[Qin dynasty]] in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the [[Huaqing Chi]] palace was later built.

Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground to the building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water (typically starting at {{convert|10|-|12|C|F|disp=or}}) as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures.<ref name=\"heatpumps9-4\">[[Dharendra Yogi Goswami|Goswami, Yogi D.]], [[Frank Kreith|Kreith, Frank]], Johnson, Katherine (2008), p. 9-4.</ref> In contrast, an [[air-source heat pump]] draws heat from the air (colder outside air) and thus requires more energy.\n\nGround source heat pumps (GSHPs) are ''not'' geothermal, i.e. there is no geyser providing heat to be captured. A GSHP merely accesses stored solar heat energy in the soil or rock.  GSHPs circulate a carrier fluid (usually a mixture of water and small amounts of antifreeze) through closed pipe loops buried in the ground. Single-home systems can be \"vertical loop field\" systems with bore holes {{convert|50|-|400|ft|m|sigfig=2}} deep <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/wells/geothermal.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203060622/http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/wells/geothermal.html |archive-date=2014-02-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> or, if adequate land is available for extensive trenches, a \"horizontal loop field\" is installed approximately six feet subsurface. As the fluid circulates underground it absorbs heat from the ground and, on its return, the warmed fluid passes through the heat pump which uses electricity to extract heat from the fluid. The re-chilled fluid is sent back into the ground thus continuing the cycle. The heat extracted and that generated by the heat pump appliance as a byproduct is used to heat the house. The addition of the ground heating loop in the energy equation means that significantly more heat can be transferred to a building than if electricity alone had been used directly for heating.\n\nSwitching the direction of heat flow, the same system can be used to circulate the cooled water through the house for cooling in the summer months. The heat is exhausted to the relatively cooler ground (or groundwater) rather than delivering it to the hot outside air as an air conditioner does. As a result, the heat is pumped across a larger temperature difference and this leads to higher efficiency and lower energy use.<ref name=\"heatpumps9-4\"/>\n\nThis technology makes ground source heating economically viable in any geographical location. In 2004, an estimated million ground-source heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW extracted 88 PJ of heat energy for space heating. Global ground-source heat pump capacity is growing by 10% annually.<ref name=\"IPCC\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Oldest geothermal.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest known pool fed by a hot spring, built in the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century BC.]]\n\n[[Hot springs]] have been used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Cataldi | first = Raffaele | date =August 1993 | title =Review of historiographic aspects of geothermal energy in the Mediterranean and Mesoamerican areas prior to the Modern Age | journal =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | volume =15 | issue =1 | pages = 13\u201316 | url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/bulletin/bi046.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-11-01}}</ref> The oldest known spa is a stone pool on [[China]]'s [[Mount Li]] built in the [[Qin dynasty]] in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the [[Huaqing Chi]] palace was later built.

With a population of 51,121 ({{As of|2019|01|01|lc=on}}),<ref name=\"pop1\" /> the city is a business and educational centre for the region and the 10th largest city in Denmark. It is governed by the administrative council of Roskilde Municipality.\n\nRoskilde has a long history, dating from the pre-Christian [[Viking Age]]. Its UNESCO-listed [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Roskilde Cathedral|cathedral]], now housing 39 tombs of the Danish monarchs, was completed in 1275, becoming a focus of religious influence until the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]].\nWith the development of the rail network in the 19th century, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen, and by the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. Among the largest private sector employers today are the IT firm BEC (Bankernes EDB Central) and GPI (Glim Plastic Industri), specializing in plastics. The [[Ris\u00f8 DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy|Ris\u00f8]] research facility is also becoming a major employer, extending interest in sustainable energy to the [[clean technology]] sphere. The [[Roskilde University|local university]], founded in 1972, the historic [[Roskilde Cathedral School|Cathedral School]], and the [[Danish Meat Trade College]], established in 1964, are educational institutions of note. Roskilde has a [[Roskilde Sygehus|large local hospital]] which has been expanded and modernized since it was opened in 1855. It is now increasingly active in the research sphere. The [[Sankt Hans Hospital|Sankt Hans psychiatric hospital]] serves the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]] with specialized facilities for [[forensic psychiatry]].\n\nThe cathedral and the [[Viking Ship Museum (Roskilde)|Viking Ship Museum]], which contains the well-preserved remains of five 11th-century ships, attract more than 100,000 visitors annually. In addition to its internationally recognized tourist attractions and its annual [[Roskilde Festival|rock festival]], Roskilde is popular with shoppers thanks to its two centrally located pedestrian streets complete with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and a variety of shops. The city is home to the [[FC Roskilde]] football club which play in the [[Danish 1st Division]], the [[Roskilde Vikings RK]] rugby club, and the rowing club, [[Roskilde Roklub]]. In the 1970s, the city benefited from the opening of the university and from the completion of the [[Danish national road 21|Holb\u00e6k Motorway]] connecting it to Copenhagen. Roskilde has the oldest operational [[Roskilde station|railway station]] in Denmark, with connections across Zealand as well as with [[Falster]], [[Lolland]], and [[Jutland]]. The local [[Roskilde Airport|airport]] opened in 1973, mainly serving light aircraft for business use and flight instruction.\n\nAmong the city's notable citizens are [[Absalon]], the bishop who founded Copenhagen in the 12th century, [[L. A. Ring]], the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] painter who gained fame in the 1880s, the writer [[Lise N\u00f8rgaard]] who wrote the popular Danish TV series ''[[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]]'' in 1978 and the rower [[Thomas Ebert]] who became an Olympic gold medallist in 2004.\n\n==History==\nRoskilde, which developed as the hub of the Viking land and sea trade routes over a thousand years ago, is one of Denmark's oldest cities. From the 11th century until 1443, it was the capital of Denmark.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510041/Roskilde|title=Roskilde|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> By the [[Middle Ages]], with the support of kings and bishops, it had become one of the most important centres in Scandinavia.<ref name=vrh/> The ''[[Saxo Grammaticus]]'' and other early sources associate the name Roskilde (meaning \"Ro's spring\") with the legendary [[Hro\u00f0gar|King Roar]] who possibly lived there in the 6th century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Nordisk_Mytologi/Sagnfigurer/Roar_og_Helge|title=Roar og Helge|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|date=9 December 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> \n[[File:Old mao of Roskilde.jpg|thumb|Old map of Roskilde]]\nAccording to [[Adam of Bremen]] and the ''Saxo Grammaticus'', Roskilde was founded in the 980s by [[Harald Bluetooth]].

Today's cathedral was completed in 1275 after five of Absalon's successors had contributed to its construction. As a result of Absalon's influence, many other churches were built in the vicinity, making Roskilde the most important town in Zealand. Coins were minted there from the 11th to the 14th century.<ref name=dcbh/> In 1150, [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn Grathe]] built a moat around the city.<ref name=dsdrh/> The Roskilde bishops owned large areas of land in the region including, from 1186, Havn on the [[\u00d8resund]] which later became Copenhagen.

These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/privilegier/by.asp?koebstadID=44|title=Den Digitale Byport: Roskilde|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=9 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> By that time, it was probably the largest and most important town in Denmark.

While the cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, most of the other religious institutions disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1657\u201358)|Dano-Swedish War]] which terminated with the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658,<ref name=roscomh>{{cite web|url=http://roskilde.com/cmarter.asp?doc=2963&node=977|title=History of Roskilde|publisher=Roskilde.com|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=}}</ref> the plague in 1710 and 1711,<ref name=\"Frandsen2010\">{{cite book|last=Frandsen|first=Karl-Erik|title=The Last Plague in the Baltic Region, 1709\u20131713|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3bNWrVRMb8C&pg=PA460|date=January 2010|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-87-635-0770-7|pages=460\u2013}}</ref> and a series of fires in 1730.<ref name=roscomh/> Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (''R\u00e5dgivende St\u00e6nderforsamling'') and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.<ref name=dcbh/>\n\n[[File:Maglekilde-Maskinfabrik.jpg|thumb|right|Maglekilde Machine Factory (completed 1865)]]\nWith the development of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered from the fact that the harbour was too small and [[Roskilde Fjord]] too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (''De Danske Spritfabrikker'') and the slaughterhouse (''Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri'').<ref name=dcbh/>\n\nIn the 1970s, the city benefited from the [[Danish national road 21|Holb\u00e6k Motorway]] which linked it to Copenhagen and the establishment of [[Roskilde University]] in 1972. Since the 1980s, the service sector has prospered, replacing manufacturing industry as the major employer (65% by 2002).<ref name=dcbh/> With the increase in population, several new districts have grown up, including [[Himmelev]] and Kongebakken.

With a population of 51,121 ({{As of|2019|01|01|lc=on}}),<ref name=\"pop1\" /> the city is a business and educational centre for the region and the 10th largest city in Denmark. It is governed by the administrative council of Roskilde Municipality.\n\nRoskilde has a long history, dating from the pre-Christian [[Viking Age]]. Its UNESCO-listed [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Roskilde Cathedral|cathedral]], now housing 39 tombs of the Danish monarchs, was completed in 1275, becoming a focus of religious influence until the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]].\nWith the development of the rail network in the 19th century, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen, and by the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. Among the largest private sector employers today are the IT firm BEC (Bankernes EDB Central) and GPI (Glim Plastic Industri), specializing in plastics. The [[Ris\u00f8 DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy|Ris\u00f8]] research facility is also becoming a major employer, extending interest in sustainable energy to the [[clean technology]] sphere. The [[Roskilde University|local university]], founded in 1972, the historic [[Roskilde Cathedral School|Cathedral School]], and the [[Danish Meat Trade College]], established in 1964, are educational institutions of note. Roskilde has a [[Roskilde Sygehus|large local hospital]] which has been expanded and modernized since it was opened in 1855. It is now increasingly active in the research sphere. The [[Sankt Hans Hospital|Sankt Hans psychiatric hospital]] serves the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]] with specialized facilities for [[forensic psychiatry]].\n\nThe cathedral and the [[Viking Ship Museum (Roskilde)|Viking Ship Museum]], which contains the well-preserved remains of five 11th-century ships, attract more than 100,000 visitors annually. In addition to its internationally recognized tourist attractions and its annual [[Roskilde Festival|rock festival]], Roskilde is popular with shoppers thanks to its two centrally located pedestrian streets complete with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and a variety of shops. The city is home to the [[FC Roskilde]] football club which play in the [[Danish 1st Division]], the [[Roskilde Vikings RK]] rugby club, and the rowing club, [[Roskilde Roklub]]. In the 1970s, the city benefited from the opening of the university and from the completion of the [[Danish national road 21|Holb\u00e6k Motorway]] connecting it to Copenhagen. Roskilde has the oldest operational [[Roskilde station|railway station]] in Denmark, with connections across Zealand as well as with [[Falster]], [[Lolland]], and [[Jutland]]. The local [[Roskilde Airport|airport]] opened in 1973, mainly serving light aircraft for business use and flight instruction.\n\nAmong the city's notable citizens are [[Absalon]], the bishop who founded Copenhagen in the 12th century, [[L. A. Ring]], the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] painter who gained fame in the 1880s, the writer [[Lise N\u00f8rgaard]] who wrote the popular Danish TV series ''[[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]]'' in 1978 and the rower [[Thomas Ebert]] who became an Olympic gold medallist in 2004.\n\n==History==\nRoskilde, which developed as the hub of the Viking land and sea trade routes over a thousand years ago, is one of Denmark's oldest cities. From the 11th century until 1443, it was the capital of Denmark.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510041/Roskilde|title=Roskilde|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> By the [[Middle Ages]], with the support of kings and bishops, it had become one of the most important centres in Scandinavia.<ref name=vrh/> The ''[[Saxo Grammaticus]]'' and other early sources associate the name Roskilde (meaning \"Ro's spring\") with the legendary [[Hro\u00f0gar|King Roar]] who possibly lived there in the 6th century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Nordisk_Mytologi/Sagnfigurer/Roar_og_Helge|title=Roar og Helge|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|date=9 December 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> \n[[File:Old mao of Roskilde.jpg|thumb|Old map of Roskilde]]\nAccording to [[Adam of Bremen]] and the ''Saxo Grammaticus'', Roskilde was founded in the 980s by [[Harald Bluetooth]].

At the time, there were also two churches in the area: [[St J\u00f8rgensbjerg Church|St J\u00f8rgensbjerg]], an early stone church, and a wooden church discovered under today's [[St Ib's Church, Roskilde|St Ib's Church]].<ref name=dsdrh>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/Roskilde/Roskilde_%28Historie%29|title=Roskilde \u2013 historie|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=9 December 2014|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjk.dk/om-kirken/sognets-historie/havneby-ca-1040-ca-1250|title=Havneby ca. 1040 \u2013 ca. 1250|publisher=Sankt J\u00f8rgensbjerg Kirke, Roskilde|accessdate=9 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Harald was buried in the wooden church he had built on the site of today's [[Roskilde Cathedral]].<ref name=vrh>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitroskilde.com/ln-int/roskilde-lejre/roskildes-history|title=Roskilde's history|publisher=Visit Roskilde|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1020, [[King Canute]] elevated [[Roskilde (titular see)|Roskilde]] to a bishopric, giving it high national status.<ref name=dcbh/> [[Absalon]], the Danish bishop, had a brick church built on the site of Harald's church in 1170. Today's cathedral was completed in 1275 after five of Absalon's successors had contributed to its construction. As a result of Absalon's influence, many other churches were built in the vicinity, making Roskilde the most important town in Zealand. Coins were minted there from the 11th to the 14th century.<ref name=dcbh/> In 1150, [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn Grathe]] built a moat around the city.<ref name=dsdrh/> The Roskilde bishops owned large areas of land in the region including, from 1186, Havn on the [[\u00d8resund]] which later became Copenhagen. By the time of the [[Danish Reformation]] in 1536, there were 12 churches and five monasteries in the city.<ref name=dcbh/>\n[[File:Roskilde ratusz mpazdziora.jpg|thumb|left|The former city hall of Roskilde, completed in 1884]]\nIt is not clear when Roskilde became a market town but it was certainly enjoying trading privileges under [[Eric II of Denmark|King Eric II]] who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/privilegier/by.asp?koebstadID=44|title=Den Digitale Byport: Roskilde|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=9 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> By that time, it was probably the largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.<ref name=dsdrh/>\n\nThe Reformation brought Roskilde's development to an abrupt stop. While the cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, most of the other religious institutions disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1657\u201358)|Dano-Swedish War]] which terminated with the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658,<ref name=roscomh>{{cite web|url=http://roskilde.com/cmarter.asp?doc=2963&node=977|title=History of Roskilde|publisher=Roskilde.com|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=}}</ref> the plague in 1710 and 1711,<ref name=\"Frandsen2010\">{{cite book|last=Frandsen|first=Karl-Erik|title=The Last Plague in the Baltic Region, 1709\u20131713|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3bNWrVRMb8C&pg=PA460|date=January 2010|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-87-635-0770-7|pages=460\u2013}}</ref> and a series of fires in 1730.<ref name=roscomh/> Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (''R\u00e5dgivende St\u00e6nderforsamling'') and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.<ref name=dcbh/>\n\n[[File:Maglekilde-Maskinfabrik.jpg|thumb|right|Maglekilde Machine Factory (completed 1865)]]\nWith the development of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered from the fact that the harbour was too small and [[Roskilde Fjord]] too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (''De Danske Spritfabrikker'') and the slaughterhouse (''Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri'').<ref name=dcbh/>\n\nIn the 1970s, the city benefited from the [[Danish national road 21|Holb\u00e6k Motorway]] which linked it to Copenhagen and the establishment of [[Roskilde University]] in 1972. Since the 1980s, the service sector has prospered, replacing manufacturing industry as the major employer (65% by 2002).<ref name=dcbh/> With the increase in population, several new districts have grown up, including [[Himmelev]] and Kongebakken. Some of the surrounding villages such as [[Svogerslev]], Vor Frue, [[Vindinge, Roskilde Municipality|Vindinge]] and Veddelev have developed as satellite communities.<ref name=dsdr>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/Roskilde|title=Roskilde|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Boserup Skov, Roskilde.jpg|thumb|Boserup Skov]]\nRoskilde is located in north-central [[Zealand]] at the south end of Roskilde Fjord which is itself the south branch of the [[Isefjord]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Indre_danske_farvande/Roskilde_Fjord|title=Roskilde Fjord|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> By road, it is {{convert|35.6|km}} west of downtown Copenhagen, {{convert|25.8|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[K\u00f8ge]] and {{convert|39.8|km}} northeast of [[Ringsted]].<ref name=\"GM\"/> The city centre around the cathedral, {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}} south of the fjord, is about {{convert|40|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=\"GM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.lu/maps/place/4000+Roskilde,+D%C3%A4nemark/@55.6701434,12.0813056,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46525fc995012f29:0xa00afcc1d507710|title=Roskilde|publisher=Google maps|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=}}</ref> On the slope down to the harbour, there are a number of springs, the most powerful of which is [[Maglekilde]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/kob_amt_1267-1755_01.pdf|title=Estrids stenkirke og Svend Normands katedral|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> The historic centre of the town covers the area around the main streets Skomagergade and Algade including the squares of St\u00e6ndertorvet and Hestetorvet.

They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognised standard concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make [[inference]]s.\n\n==Examples==\n# One understands the weather if one is able to [[prediction|predict]] (e.g. if it is very cloudy, it may rain) and/or give an [[explanation]] of some of its features, etc.\n# A [[psychiatrist]] understands another person's [[anxiety|anxieties]] if he/she knows that person's anxieties, their causes, and can give useful [[Advice (opinion)|advice]] on how to cope with the anxiety.\n# One understands a piece of [[rhetoric|reasoning]] or an [[logical argument|argument]] if one can consciously reproduce the information content conveyed by the message.\n# One understands a [[language]] to the extent that one can reproduce the information content conveyed by a broad range of spoken utterances or written messages in that language.\n\n==Shallow and deep==\nSomeone who has a more sophisticated understanding, more predictively accurate understanding, and/or an understanding that allows them to make explanations that others commonly judge to be better, of something, is said to understand that thing \"deeply\". Conversely, someone who has a more limited understanding of a thing is said to have a \"shallow\" understanding. However, the depth of understanding required to usefully participate in an occupation or activity may vary greatly.\n\nFor example, consider [[multiplication]] of [[integer]]s. Starting from the most shallow level of understanding, we have (at least) the following possibilities:\n\n# A small child may not understand what multiplication is, but may understand that it is a type of [[mathematics]] that they will learn when they are older at school. This is \"understanding of context\"; being able to put an as-yet not-understood concept into some kind of context. Even understanding that a concept is not part of one's current knowledge is, in itself, a type of understanding (see the [[Dunning\u2013Kruger effect]], which is about people who do not have a good understanding of what they do not know).\n# A slightly older child may understand that multiplication of two integers can be done, at least when the numbers are between 1 and 12, by looking up the two numbers in a [[times table]]. They may also be able to memorise and recall the relevant times table in order to answer a multiplication question such as \"2 times 4 is what?\". This is a simple form of operational understanding; understanding a question well enough to be able to do the operations necessary to be able to find an answer.\n# A yet older child may understand that multiplication of larger numbers can be done using a different method, such as [[long multiplication]], or using a [[calculator]]. This is a more advanced form of operational understanding because it supports answering a wider range of questions of the same type.\n# A teenager may understand that multiplication is repeated addition, but not understand the broader implications of this. For example, when their teacher refers to multiplying 6 by 3 as \"adding 6 to itself 3 times\", they may understand that the teacher is talking about two entirely equivalent things. However, they might not understand how to ''apply'' this knowledge to implement multiplication as an [[algorithm]] on a [[computer]] using only addition and [[loop (computing)|looping]] as basic constructs. This level of understanding is \"understanding a definition\" (or \"understanding the definition\" when a concept only has one definition).\n# A teenager may also understand the mathematical idea of abstracting over individual whole numbers as variables, and how to efficiently (i.e. not via trial-and-error) solve algebraic equations involving multiplication by such variables, such as <math>2x = 6</math>. This is \"relational understanding\"; understanding how multiplication relates to division.\n# An [[undergraduate]] studying mathematics may come to learn that \"the integers equipped with multiplication\" is merely one example of a range of mathematical structures called [[monoid|monoids]], and that theorems about monoids apply equally well to multiplication and other types of monoids.\n\nFor the purpose of operating a [[cash register]] at [[McDonald's]], a person does not need a very deep understanding of the multiplication involved in calculating the total price of two [[Big Mac]]s. However, for the purpose of contributing to [[number theory]] research, a person would need to have a relatively deep understanding of multiplication \u2014 along with other relevant arithmetical concepts such as division and [[prime number]]s.\n\n== Assessment ==\nIt is possible for a person, or a piece of \"intelligent\" software, that in reality only has a shallow understanding of a topic, to appear to have a deeper understanding than they actually do, when the right questions are asked of it. The most obvious way this can happen is by [[memorization]] of correct answers to known questions, but there are other, more subtle ways that a person or computer can (intentionally or otherwise) deceive somebody about their level of understanding, too. This is particularly a risk with [[artificial intelligence]], in which the ability of a piece of artificial intelligence software to very quickly try out millions of possibilities (attempted solutions, theories, etc.) could create a misleading impression of the real depth of its understanding. Supposed AI software could in fact come up with impressive [[question answering|answers to questions]] that were difficult for unaided humans to answer, without really understanding the concepts ''at all'', simply by dumbly applying rules very quickly. (However, see the [[Chinese room]] argument for a controversial philosophical extension of this argument.)\n\n[[Test (assessment)|Examinations]] are designed to assess students' understanding (and sometimes also other things such as knowledge and writing abilities) without falling prey to these risks. They do this partly by asking multiple different questions about a topic to reduce the risk of [[measurement error]], and partly by forbidding access to reference works and the outside world to reduce the risk of someone else's understanding being passed off as one's own. Because of the faster and more accurate computation and memorization abilities of computers, such tests would arguably often have to be modified if they were to be used to accurately assess the understanding of an artificial intelligence.\n\nConversely, it is even easier for a person or artificial intelligence to fake a ''shallower'' level of understanding than they actually have; they simply need to respond with the same kind of answers that someone with a more limited understanding, or no understanding, would respond with \u2014 such as \"I don't know\", or obviously wrong answers. This is relevant for judges in [[Turing test]]s; it is unlikely to be effective to simply ask the respondents to mentally calculate the answer to a very difficult arithmetical question, because the computer is likely to simply dumb itself down and pretend not to know the answer.\n\n==As a model==\n[[Gregory Chaitin]], a noted computer scientist, propounds a view that comprehension is a kind of [[data compression]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192140/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> In his essay \"The Limits of Reason\", he argues that ''understanding'' something means being able to figure out a simple set of rules that explains it.

We have compressed a large amount of information by using a simple model that [[prediction|predicts]] it. Similarly, we understand the number [[repeating decimal|0.33333...]] by thinking of it as one-third. The first way of representing the number requires five concepts (\"0\", \"decimal point\", \"3\", \"infinity\", \"infinity of 3\"); but the second way can produce all the data of the first representation, but uses only three concepts (\"1\", \"division\", \"3\").
