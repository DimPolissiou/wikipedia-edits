It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=501|3a1=King|3y=2002|3p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\",{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} while William F. Lewis commented that the movement's diversity \"has produced a complexity which is overwhelming to the observer\".{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=14}}\n\nThe term \"Rastafari\" derives from the pre-regnal title of [[Haile Selassie]], \"Ras Tafari Makonnen\"; the term \"Ras\" means a duke or prince, while \"Tafari Makonen\" was his name.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Ifekwe|2y=2008|2p=111|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=32|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=217}} It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} As well as being the religion's name, it is also used for the religion's practitioners themselves.{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=218}} Many commentators\u2014including some academic sources{{sfnm|1a1=Forsythe|1y=1980|1p=64|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=2, 103|4a1=King|4y=1998|4p=51|5a1=Middleton|5y=2006|5p=152|6a1=Glazier|6y=2012|6p=614|7a1=Chawane|7y=2014|7p=218}}\u2014refer to the movement as \"Rastafarianism\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=8}} This term has also been used by some practitioners.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=187}} However, the term \"Rastafarianism\" is considered embarrassing by many Rastas, who believe it has connotations of doctrine and organisation which they wish to avoid.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=8|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=218}} Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as \"insensitive\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n\n[[File:Liberty Bell Temple 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The Liberty Bell Temple in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|US]] was established by the American Rasta [[Ed Forchion]]]]\nRastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as \"Rastalogy\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} Edmonds described Rastafari as having \"a fairly cohesive worldview\";{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were \"fluid and open to interpretation\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=v}} Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a [[catechism]] or [[creed]] within the movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}}\n\nRastas place great emphasis on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=49\u201350, 63}} No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and which are [[heterodox]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}} The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma \"is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma\", according to Clarke.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}}\n\nRastafari is deeply influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Warner-Lewis|1y=1993|1p=108|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=183}} and shares many commonalities with Christianity.{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=231}} Michael Barnett noted that its theology is \"essentially Judeo-Christian\", representing \"an Afrocentralized blend of Christianity and Judaism\".{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=882}} Some Rastas openly describe themselves as Christians.{{sfn|Bedasse|2013|p=302}} It accords the [[Bible]] a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=14|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=74|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=184|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=232}} and adopts a [[Biblical literalism|literalist interpretation]] of its contents.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} According to the anthropologist [[Stephen D. Glazier]], Rasta approaches to the Bible result in the religion adopting an outlook that is very similar to forms of [[Protestantism]].{{sfn|Glazier|2012|p=614}} Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black African history and their place as God's favoured people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} They regard the Bible as the key to understanding both the past and the present and for predicting the future,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} while also regarding it as a source book from which they can form and legitimate their religious beliefs and practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=127|2a1=Mhango|2y=2008|2p=222}} Rastas commonly regard the final book of the Bible, the [[Book of Revelation]], as the most important part, because they see its contents as having particular significance for the world's present situation.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=73}}\n\nContrary to scholarly understandings of how the Bible was compiled, Rastas commonly believe it was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of [[Amharic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=127}} They also believe that the Bible's true meaning has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those seeking to deny black Africans their history.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=74|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=64|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=502}} They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=74}} They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation with the \"book within\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} As a result of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on black African history.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}} Common texts used for this purpose include [[Leonard Howell]]'s 1935 work ''[[The Promised Key]]'', [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]]' 1924 book ''[[Holy Piby]]'', and [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] 1920s work, the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]''.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}}\n\n===Jah and Jesus of Nazareth===\n\n[[File:Rasta Mural, Sheshemane (11417146756).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta mural in Sheshame, Ethiopia depicting Haile Selassie and the Lion of Judah]]\n\nRastafari are [[monotheism|monotheists]], worshiping a singular God whom they call [[Jah]].

I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.\"{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=70}} His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is \"no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=71}} Critics of Rastafari have used this as evidence that Rasta theological beliefs are incorrect,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} however for some Rastas, Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God, based on their reading of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 14:11.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=108|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=511}}\n\n===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===\n\n[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]\nAccording to Clarke, Rastafari is \"concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica while creating a new identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Its emphasis is on purging any belief in the inferiority of black people, and the superiority of white people, from the minds of its followers.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=864}} Rastafari is therefore Afrocentric,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2006|1p=882|2a1=Wittmann|2y=2011|2p=152}} equating blackness with the African continent,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} and thus endorsing a form of Pan-Africanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=39|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2p=311}}\n\nPractitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]\u2014God's [[chosen people]] in the Old Testament\u2014and believe that black Africans broadly or Rastas more specifically are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=168|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=129|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=17|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=111|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=38}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} although many Rastas believe that modern Jews' claims to be the descendants of the ancient Israelites are false.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=240}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's chosen people, meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=81|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=885}} Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of any feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}\n\nThere is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing in [[Scientific racism|the existence of a distinct black African race]] that is superior to other racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=169|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=191|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=113|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=504}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an \"implicit potential\" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not \"intrinsic\" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European can ever be a legitimate Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Others believe that an \"African\" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African \"attitude\" or \"spirit\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}\n\n====Babylon and Zion====\n\nRastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in \"Babylon\", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eyre|1y=1985|1p=145|2a1=Pereira|2y=1998|2p=31|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38\u201340}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175\u2013176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term \"Babylon\" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia with the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In the [[New Testament]], \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}\n\nRastas regard Babylon as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} They perceive the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development,{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} and are often hostile to Western resource extraction from the continent.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Rastas often expect white-dominant society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens they see it as confirmation of the correctness of their faith.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|A map of Ethiopia, the \"Zion\" of the Rastas]]\n\nRastas view \"[[Zion]]\" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with \"Babylon\", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas usually use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse;{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=77|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=41}} many Rastas use the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=294}}

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}\n\n====Salvation and

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as

public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in

The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98\u201399|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19\u201320}} One of the most prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}}\n\n===International spread and decline: 1970\u2013present===\n[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rasta vendor plies his wares in the U.S. city of [[Washington D.C.]] in 2013]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=1998|2p=41|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=91\u201392|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n===Mansions of Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of

[[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=962|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=11}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}} Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}} and in South Africa;{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=220}} in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|p=234}} At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Benjamin Zephaniah University of Hull.jpg|thumb|right|The poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] is a prominent British Rasta]]\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Rastas were among the [[British African-Caribbean people|thousands of Caribbean migrants settling in the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture;

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=501|3a1=King|3y=2002|3p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\",{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} while William F.

that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily

endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have

as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as

public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted multiple female sex partners,{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=252|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies but is a [[common law marriage|common law]]

relationships are known as \"kingmen\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=245|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87\u201388}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}\n\n1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' \"[[African Herbsman]]\" and [[Peter Tosh]]'s \"Legalize It\" referenced cannabis use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\" and [[Junior Byles]]' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two are widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}\n\n===Language and symbolism===\n\n{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}\nIn the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as \"dreadtalk\", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92\u201393}} They believe that by formulating their own language they are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the [[English language]], which they view as a tool of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=46, 47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish and separate themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509}} for whom\u2014according to Barrett\u2014Rasta rhetoric can be \"meaningless babbling\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975\u20131987).svg|thumb|left|Rastas regularly use the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for their movement, although often add black to this tricolour, symbolising the black skin of the African people]]\nRastas make wide use of the pronoun \"I\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=92|3a1=Chevannes|3y=1994|3p=167|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=509|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use \"I\" in place of \"me\", \"I and I\" in place of \"we\", \"I-ceive\" in place of \"receive\", \"I-sire\" in place of \"desire\", \"I-rate\" in place of \"create\", and \"I-men\" in place of \"[[Amen]]\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as \"InI Consciousness\" or \"Isciousness\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as \"Haile Selassie I\", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word \"downpression\" in place of \"oppression\" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with \"up\" being phonetically akin to the \"opp-\".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour \"livicate\" over \"dedicate\" because \"ded-\" is phonetically akin to the word \"dead\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} In its early decades, Rastas often said \"Peace and Love\" as a greeting, although the use of this declined as the religion aged.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=269|2a1=Semaj|2y=2013|2p=108}}\n\nRastas often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, the Jamaican [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] activist Marcus Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolised the blood of martyrs, the black symbolised the skin of Africans, and the green represented the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom. Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41\u201342}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38\u201339}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem,{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} with many regarding him as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Semaj|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=221}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}\n\n===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930\u20131949===\n\nHaile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2\u20135; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132|3a1=Loadenthal|3y=2013|3p=10}} Over the following years, a number of street preachers\u2014most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]\u2014began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=2|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=81|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=9}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=2}} Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by many Rastas to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.]]\n\nHowell has been described as the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85\u201386|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary

prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George

exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile

employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international

Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=962|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=11}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of

It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa\u2014for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal\u2014and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=\u2014 Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems;

The S\u014dma claimed descent from the [[Taira clan]] via the [[Chiba clan]] and took their name from the Chiba clan territories in S\u014dma District of northern [[Shim\u014dsa Province]]. The clan moved its seat from Shim\u014dsa to [[Mutsu Province]] in the early [[Kamakura period]], and were confirmed as ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[S\u014dma Nakamura Domain]] under the [[Edo period|Edo-period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n\nDuring the [[Boshin War]] of 1868\u201369, the S\u014dma clan fought on the site of the [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]], supporting the Tokugawa regime. After Meiji Restoration, the head of the S\u014dma clan became part of the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage, with [[S\u014dma Aritane]] receiving the title of ''shishaku'' (Viscount).\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Souma Morotsune.jpg|thumb|right|S\u014dma Morotsune]]\n[[S\u014dma Morotsune]] was the younger son of [[Chiba Tsunetane]], and with his father was a [[samurai]] in the service of [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. He took his name from the S\u014dma Mikuriya, a ''[[sh\u014den]]'' controlled by [[Ise Shrine]] in what is now northwest [[Chiba Prefecture]], which supplied horses to the shrine and the [[Yamato dynasty|Imperial household]]. He accompanied Yoritomo in the conquest of the [[Northern Fujiwara|Hiraizumi Fujiwara]] in 1189, and was awarded with estates covering three districts in southern Mutsu: Namekata, Shineha, and Uda.\n\nDuring the [[Nanboku-ch\u014d period]] following the fall of the Kamakura shogunate the S\u014dma were one of the few clans in Mutsu to remain loyal to the [[Northern Court]].<ref name=\"Kota\">''Monogatari: Hanshi'' Volume 1, Kodama K\u014dta, ed. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu \u014craisha, 1966, p. 278</ref>{{rp|278}}\n\n==Sengoku period==\nAlthough the S\u014dma were a minor regional power, their territory was sandwiched between the much more powerful [[Satake clan]] to the south and the [[Date clan]] to the north. The Date under [[Date Masamune]] were especially aggressive and expansionist, and despite efforts by the 16th hereditary chieftain [[S\u014dma Yoshitane]] to remain aloof of the conflicts of the [[Sengoku period]], the Date invaded his domain on 30 occasions. Both S\u014dma Yoshitane and Data Masamune submitted to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Siege of Odawara]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|title=Toyotomi Hideyoshi|year=2010|publisher=Osprey|language=English|isbn=9781846039607|page=53}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], the S\u014dma attempted to remain neutral for fear of the powerful Satake clan to the south, which was allied with [[Ishida Mitsunari]] through marriage ties. The new [[Tokugawa shogunate]] initially decided to seize the S\u014dma territories, but through the intervention of several senior retainers (including their former arch-enemy Data Masamune), the shogunate relented and appointed [[S\u014dma Toshitane]] as a ''[[tozama daimy\u014d]]'' over a 60,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[S\u014dma Nakamura Domain]] which encompassed their traditional holdings.<ref name=\"Kota\"/>{{rp|278}}\n\n==Edo period==\n{{Main|S\u014dma Nakamura Domain}}\nS\u014dma Toshitane married an adopted daughter of [[Sh\u014dgun]] [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] to further cement his position, and relocated his seat from Odaka Castle to [[S\u014dma Nakamura Castle]], building a [[castle town]] designed on a grid-pattern in imitation of [[Kyoto]]. He also sponsored the development of [[\u014cboris\u014dma ware|S\u014dma ware]] ceramics, which remains a local specialty to the present day.\n\nThe subsequent history of the domain was largely uneventful, and the S\u014dma clan retained its holdings for the entirety of the [[Edo period]], surviving until the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe official ''[[kokudaka]]'' of the domain was officially 60,000 ''[[koku]]'', but the actual ''kokudaka'' was almost 100,000 ''koku''.\n\n===Boshin War===\n\nDuring the [[Boshin War]] of 1868\u201369, the S\u014dma clan initially attempted to remain neutral as under [[S\u014dma Toshitane]] the domain was relatively small and had negligible military forces. However, following the defeat of the Tokugawa forces at the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]] in February 1868, he was pressured by his more powerful neighbors (including [[Iwakitaira Domain]] and [[Sendai Domain]]) into joining the [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]]. The [[Satch\u014d Alliance]] forces advanced through the [[Hamad\u014dri]] region and captured Nakamura Castle with only token resistance a few months later.<ref>{{in lang|ja}} Hoshi, ''\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref> His predecessor, S\u014dma Michitane, formally surrendered to the [[Meiji government]]; however, the domain was not punished, and Toshitane was restored as domain governor by the new government until the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871.\n\n==Meiji era and beyond==\n[[File:Somanakamura Castle.jpg|thumb|S\u014dma Shrine, where the ancestors of the S\u014dma clan are enshrined as ''[[kami]]'' ]]\n\nIn the early years of the [[Meiji era]], the S\u014dma Incident became a major political scandal. On April 14, 1879, the former ''daimy\u014d'' of Nakamura S\u014dma Domain, S\u014dma Toshitane, was placed under [[house arrest]] by the government, after family members filed a petition accusing him of mental instability. On December 10, 1885, one of his former retainers, Nishigori Takekiyo, filed a lawsuit accusing these relatives, led by Toshitane\u2019s younger brother, S\u014dma Aritane, of having made false charges leading to Toshitane's incarceration, for the purposes of embezzling the monies of the former domain. The S\u014dma clan hired the famous lawyer [[Hoshi T\u014dru]] to defend their case, which went on for years, as the legal definition of insanity and the qualifications necessary for a doctor to declare a person mentally incompetent were not yet defined in Japanese jurisprudence. On Toshitane's death in 1892, Nishigori accused the defendants of having murdered him by poison. However, after an autopsy failed to find any evidence, Nishikori was countersued for slander and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nMarquis S\u014dma Aritane (1863\u20131919) was the 30th hereditary chieftain of the clan, and acquired a 15,000 ''[[tsubo]]'' estate in Tokyo to the west of the [[Konoe family]] in 1910. His son, Marquis S\u014dma Taketane (1889\u20131936) served in the [[Imperial Household Agency]] and accompanied [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]] to France, where he became fascinated with golf. His son, Marquis S\u014dma Yasutane (1913\u20131994) was married to a daughter of [[Ozaki Yukio]]. he also served in the Imperial Household Agency and was the 8th Chairman of the Japan Racehorse Owners Association. He was largely responsible for reviving the traditional [[S\u014dma Nomaoi]] Festival. He also served as mayor of the city of [[S\u014dma, Fukushima|S\u014dma]]. The current clan head, the 34th hereditary chieftain is S\u014dma Yukitane, the grandson of S\u014dma Yasutane.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reference==\n*[[Seiichi Iwao|Iwao, Seiichi]].

The S\u014dma claimed descent from the [[Taira clan]] via the [[Chiba clan]] and took their name from the Chiba clan territories in S\u014dma District of northern [[Shim\u014dsa Province]]. The clan moved its seat from Shim\u014dsa to [[Mutsu Province]] in the early [[Kamakura period]], and were confirmed as ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[S\u014dma Nakamura Domain]] under the [[Edo period|Edo-period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n\nDuring the [[Boshin War]] of 1868\u201369, the S\u014dma clan fought on the site of the [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]], supporting the Tokugawa regime. After Meiji Restoration, the head of the S\u014dma clan became part of the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage, with [[S\u014dma Aritane]] receiving the title of ''shishaku'' (Viscount).\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Souma Morotsune.jpg|thumb|right|S\u014dma Morotsune]]\n[[S\u014dma Morotsune]] was the younger son of [[Chiba Tsunetane]], and with his father was a [[samurai]] in the service of [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. He took his name from the S\u014dma Mikuriya, a ''[[sh\u014den]]'' controlled by [[Ise Shrine]] in what is now northwest [[Chiba Prefecture]], which supplied horses to the shrine and the [[Yamato dynasty|Imperial household]]. He accompanied Yoritomo in the conquest of the [[Northern Fujiwara|Hiraizumi Fujiwara]] in 1189, and was awarded with estates covering three districts in southern Mutsu: Namekata, Shineha, and Uda.\n\nDuring the [[Nanboku-ch\u014d period]] following the fall of the Kamakura shogunate the S\u014dma were one of the few clans in Mutsu to remain loyal to the [[Northern Court]].<ref name=\"Kota\">''Monogatari: Hanshi'' Volume 1, Kodama K\u014dta, ed. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu \u014craisha, 1966, p. 278</ref>{{rp|278}}\n\n==Sengoku period==\nAlthough the S\u014dma were a minor regional power, their territory was sandwiched between the much more powerful [[Satake clan]] to the south and the [[Date clan]] to the north. The Date under [[Date Masamune]] were especially aggressive and expansionist, and despite efforts by the 16th hereditary chieftain [[S\u014dma Yoshitane]] to remain aloof of the conflicts of the [[Sengoku period]], the Date invaded his domain on 30 occasions. Both S\u014dma Yoshitane and Data Masamune submitted to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Siege of Odawara]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|title=Toyotomi Hideyoshi|year=2010|publisher=Osprey|language=English|isbn=9781846039607|page=53}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], the S\u014dma attempted to remain neutral for fear of the powerful Satake clan to the south, which was allied with [[Ishida Mitsunari]] through marriage ties. The new [[Tokugawa shogunate]] initially decided to seize the S\u014dma territories, but through the intervention of several senior retainers (including their former arch-enemy Data Masamune), the shogunate relented and appointed [[S\u014dma Toshitane]] as a ''[[tozama daimy\u014d]]'' over a 60,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[S\u014dma Nakamura Domain]] which encompassed their traditional holdings.<ref name=\"Kota\"/>{{rp|278}}\n\n==Edo period==\n{{Main|S\u014dma Nakamura Domain}}\nS\u014dma Toshitane married an adopted daughter of [[Sh\u014dgun]] [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] to further cement his position, and relocated his seat from Odaka Castle to [[S\u014dma Nakamura Castle]], building a [[castle town]] designed on a grid-pattern in imitation of [[Kyoto]]. He also sponsored the development of [[\u014cboris\u014dma ware|S\u014dma ware]] ceramics, which remains a local specialty to the present day.\n\nThe subsequent history of the domain was largely uneventful, and the S\u014dma clan retained its holdings for the entirety of the [[Edo period]], surviving until the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe official ''[[kokudaka]]'' of the domain was officially 60,000 ''[[koku]]'', but the actual ''kokudaka'' was almost 100,000 ''koku''.\n\n===Boshin War===\n\nDuring the [[Boshin War]] of 1868\u201369, the S\u014dma clan initially attempted to remain neutral as under [[S\u014dma Toshitane]] the domain was relatively small and had negligible military forces. However, following the defeat of the Tokugawa forces at the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]] in February 1868, he was pressured by his more powerful neighbors (including [[Iwakitaira Domain]] and [[Sendai Domain]]) into joining the [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]]. The [[Satch\u014d Alliance]] forces advanced through the [[Hamad\u014dri]] region and captured Nakamura Castle with only token resistance a few months later.<ref>{{in lang|ja}} Hoshi, ''\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref> His predecessor, S\u014dma Michitane, formally surrendered to the [[Meiji government]]; however, the domain was not punished, and Toshitane was restored as domain governor by the new government until the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871.\n\n==Meiji era and beyond==\n[[File:Somanakamura Castle.jpg|thumb|S\u014dma Shrine, where the ancestors of the S\u014dma clan are enshrined as ''[[kami]]'' ]]\n\nIn the early years of the [[Meiji era]], the S\u014dma Incident became a major political scandal. On April 14, 1879, the former ''daimy\u014d'' of Nakamura S\u014dma Domain, S\u014dma Toshitane, was placed placed under [[house arrest]] by the government, after family members filed a petition accusing him of mental instability. On December 10, 1885, one of his former retainers, Nishigori Takekiyo, filed a lawsuit accusing these relatives, led by Toshitane\u2019s younger brother, S\u014dma Aritane, of having made false charges leading to Toshitane's incarceration, for the purposes of embezzling the monies of the former domain. The S\u014dma clan hired the famous lawyer [[Hoshi T\u014dru]] to defend their case, which went on for years, as the legal definition of insanity and the qualifications necessary for a doctor to declare a person mentally incompetent were not yet defined in Japanese jurisprudence. On Toshitane's death in 1892, Nishigori accused the defendants of having murdered him by poison. However, after an autopsy failed to find any evidence, Nishikori was countersued for slander and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nMarquis S\u014dma Aritane (1863\u20131919) was the 30th hereditary chieftain of the clan, and acquired a 15,000 ''[[tsubo]]'' estate in Tokyo to the west of the [[Konoe family]] in 1910. His son, Marquis S\u014dma Taketane (1889\u20131936) served in the [[Imperial Household Agency]] and accompanied [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]] to France, where he became fascinated with golf. His son, Marquis S\u014dma Yasutane (1913\u20131994) was married to a daughter of [[Ozaki Yukio]]. he also served in the Imperial Household Agency and was the 8th Chairman of the Japan Racehorse Owners Association. He was largely responsible for reviving the traditional [[S\u014dma Nomaoi]] Festival. He also served as mayor of the city of [[S\u014dma, Fukushima|S\u014dma]]. The current clan head, the 34th hereditary chieftain is S\u014dma Yukitane, the grandson of S\u014dma Yasutane.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reference==\n*[[Seiichi Iwao|Iwao, Seiichi]].

In addition Dumbarton played in the [[Dumbartonshire Cup]], the [[Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup|Glasgow Charity Cup]] and the Greenock and District Charity Cup.\n\n==Story of the Season==\nDumbarton entered season 1891-92 as the defending league champions, with an almost unchanged side.  The battle between professionalism and amateurism in football still raged, but for now playing for the love of the game still won in Scotland.\n\n===August===\nThe season opened on 8 August with a trip to the borders, where a friendly 3-3 draw was played against 5th KRV.  A further pre-season friendly was played 4 days later at Airdrie \u2013 a 2-0 reverse being suffered.\n\nThe league campaign opened on 15 August, with an away fixture against Cambuslang. The team turned out as follows: McLeod (goal); Watson and McMillan (full backs); Lang, Boyle and keir (half backs); Taylor, Bell.W, Miller.j, Thomson and Bell.J (forwards). Taylor was the first to score for the Sons after 20 minutes and Thomson followed before the interval. The second half was evenly contested and the game finished 2-0.\n\nA week later, the unfurling of the (joint) league champions flag was celebrated at Boghead where Abercorn were the visitors on league duty. The places of Watson, Lang and W.Bell were taken by A.Miller, John Gillan and McNaught respectively. Bell netted his first goal of the season in five minutes and three more followed by half time \u2013 with Abercorn missing a penalty. In the second half it was more of the same with the final score being 8-1.\n\nOn 29 August the two unbeaten sides in the league so far met, as Hearts took on Dumbarton at Tynecastle. A full strength side took to the field as Watson and Galbraith returned to the side. The Sons got off to a good start and an early \u2018goal\u2019 was ruled out for offside. Hearts then came more into the game and scored first, though Dumbarton equalised from an own goal before half time. Early in the second half the visitors \u2018scored\u2019 again but the referee did not see the ball cross the line. Luck wasn't with the Sons and Hearts took advantage with a quick brace, the second being a Miller own goal \u2013 leaving the final score at 3-1.\n\nThe result left Hearts on top of the table, with Dumbarton and Celtic leading the chase 2 points behind.\n\n===September===\nOn 5 September, Dumbarton travelled to Ibrox to play last season's joint champions Rangers in a league fixture. Only one change was made with Thomson coming back in place of Galbraith. The Sons were ahead within 10 minutes from a Taylor goal, and just a minute later the same player made it two, with the hat trick being completed after 15 minutes. Rangers were a disappointing lot and it wasn't till late on that they scored a consolation goal leaving the result at 3-1.\n\nA week later Leith Athletic were visitors to Boghead in their league encounter. Miller failed to appear and was replaced by McDonald with Galbraith coming in for McMillan. Taylor continued his recent goal scoring form by having the Sons two. The other Dumbarton forwards decided to join in the second half with Miller(2); McNaught and Bell completing a 6-0 thrashing.\n\nHearts, the early league pace setters, played their return league fixture against Dumbarton at Boghead on 19 September. Miller and Thomson returned to the side. The Sons were quickest off the mark and McNaught had the home side ahead within nine minutes. Miller and Bell made it three before 15 minutes had passed. Bell then scored again before Hearts got one back \u2013 4-1 after 20 minutes. Understandably the pace of the game dropped and there were no more goals before the interval. Watson had been injured in the first half and had retired for a time, and although he returned in the second half he was clearly unfit. Nevertheless, it was not until two minutes from the final whistle that Miller scored the last goal of the game for a 5-1 thumping.\n\nOn 26 September Dumbarton were at Celtic Park to play off a league fixture. Watson had not recovered from his injury and was replaced by McDonald. Both teams played a fast and exciting game and despite chances falling to both the interval was reached goalless. It only took five minutes however for Celtic to take the lead in the second half and while the Sons had numerous attempts at equalising, they came to nothing and in the end the Celts scored a second just on full-time being called.\n\nSo the end of September still saw Hearts in the lead with 13 points, 3 points ahead of the chasing pack of Celtic, Dumbarton and Leith Athletic.\n\n===October===\nAt the beginning of the season a Canadian international touring side played a series of matches in the UK. One of these was against a Scotland XI on 3 October at Ibrox Park. John McLeod and John Bell played in the 5-1 win for the Scots, with Bell scoring two of the goals.\n\nOn the same day Dumbarton visited county neighbours, Vale of Leven, on league business. In addition to the missing personnel from the representative match Taylor's place was taken by a trialist. A goal from Miller after 40 minutes was all that separated the teams at half time. A penalty brought Vale level but an own goal shortly before the end provided the Sons with a 2-1 win.\n\nA free week was followed on 17 October with a home league fixture against Third Lanark.  McLeod returned to the team but Watson and Bell were absent. Nevertheless, the weakened team played well and goals in each half by Miller were enough for a 2-0 victory.\n\nSt Mirren were the next visitors to Boghead on 24 October where an unchanged side was fielded by Dumbarton. Taylor and Miller (his fourth goal in three games) had the Sons two ahead by the interval. In the second half Taylor scored again before the saints got one back. A converted penalty kick by McMillan made it four before a late St Mirren flurry saw the final score being 4-2.\n\nOn the last day of the month the Sons travelled to Edinburgh to play the return league fixture against Leith Athletic. Bell returned but Taylor and Miller were missing from the team. Bell wasted no time in adding to his goal tally by scoring Dumbarton's first in 10 minutes. This was the position until Leith evened up matters midway through the second half but a McMillan strike and an own goal made the points safe for the Sons in a 3-1 win.\n\nAt the end of the month, with another 4 victories secured, Dumbarton were still in second place with 18 points from 11 games \u2013 a point behind Hearts but crucially 2 games in hand.\n\n===November===\nThe month began with a visit to county neighbours Renton for a league fixture on 7 November. Taylor returned but Galbriaith dropped out. Thomson and McMillan had the Sons two ahead after 35 minutes but Renton got one back before half time. An equaliser was scored midway through the second half but Taylor notched the winner for Dumbarton and another tow points added to the total.\n\nOn 14 November Clyde were visitors to Boghead. Miller returned at centre forward in an otherwise unchanged side. In what became a fairly one-sided match both Bell and Taylor scored hat tricks in an 8-2 thrashing.\n\nThe match against St Mirren on 21 November was postponed as Dumbarton were unable to raise a team due to illness and 2nd XI commitments.\n\nA week later there was a rest from league duty and with the first Scottish Cup encounter.  Much on the prompting of Dumbarton officials, a qualifying process had been introduced to the cup competition, and Dumbarton's first appearance was at the fifth round stage.  Glasgow Thistle were the opponents at Boghead. McLeod and Richmond were unavailable their places taken by Barr and Smith from the Seconds. Thistle held their own until half time but then goals from Taylor, Bell(2) and Miller carried the Sons through to the next round.\n\nAt the end of November the positions in the league saw Hearts lead with 21 points from 14 matches, Dumbarton a point behind but with just 12 games and Celtic in third with 16 points from just 9 games.  \n\n===December===\nDecember began with a league visit to Cathkin Park to play Third Lanark with Dumbarton fielding an unchanged side. Thirds started brightly and were two ahead early on \u2013 and had another disallowed for offside. However two goals from Bell brought the teams level before the break. Early in the second half a Thirds man had to retire injured and the Sons took full advantage of the extra man, with Bell completing his hat trick then McNaught and Thomson completing a 5-2 victory.\n\nOn 12 December, the league fixture against local rivals Vale of Leven was played at Boghead. Watson was a welcome returnee to the team while McDonald took the place of Keir. Conditions were miserable but Dumbarton played much the better. Taylor scored within seconds of the game starting, then Miller, Thomson and McDonald had the home team four ahead by half time. Another four goals had Dumbarton 8-0 in front with 20 minutes of the second half played and with the weather worsening the Vale captain intimated to the referee that the Vale team surrendered the game to the homesters.\n\nA week later it was back to Cathkin Park \u2013 but this time on Scottish Cup duty.  McLeod and Keir returned to the squad. As in the previous game between the sides Thirds were first to show and were a goal ahead after 20 minutes but McNaught got the Sons back on level terms just on half time. Luck once again deserted Thirds as one of their players retired injured and Taylor scored twice to take full advantage of the extra man. Late in the game Bell had to leave the field after being charged by a Thirds man.\n\nThe 26 December saw near neighbours Renton come to Boghead on league duty. Keir was missing from the previous week's team. The game began in atrocious conditions but McNaught had the Sons ahead within 10 minutes. Renton got the equaliser from a scrimmage but before half time Bell made the score 2-1 before half time. Despite efforts from both teams there were no further goals.\n\nThe league positions at the end of the year looked good for Dumbarton \u2013 now ahead with 28 points \u2013 five ahead of Hearts \u2013 but Celtic still posed a real danger, 10 points behind but with 6 games in hand.\n\n===January===\nThe New Year began with a visit to Celtic Park in a friendly. Lang replaced Keir in the team with Richmond coming back in place of Smith. A close contest was expected but from the minute that Taylor had the Sons ahead early on it was one-way traffic. Bell, Taylor again and Thomson(2) made it 5-0 by half time. In the second half it was more of the same with Bell getting his second, then McNaught and finally Taylor completing his hat trick for an 8-0 walloping. \nA day later, Dumbarton met hearts in a friendly at Tynecastle. The only change to the team was the resting of Taylor.  In a complete reversal of roles it was the Edinburgh side who dominated proceedings taking a 5-0 lead by the interval. Thomson saved the Sons blushes with a consolation goal in the second half but Hearts increased their tally by two for a 7-1 trouncing.\n\nThen on 4 January, Dumbarton made the trip up north to face Aberdeen. McLeod and Miller were rested but despite the missing first XI men Dumbarton came away with a fine 6-1 win.\n\nBad weather ensured that little football would be played for most of the month, until 23 January when old rivals Queen's Park came to Boghead for a seventh round Scottish Cup tie. Dumbarton were back to full strength with the return of McLeod. Keir, Taylor and both Millers. Queens opened the scoring after 15 minutes and were two up just before half time. On crossing over the Sons pressed and were rewarded by goals from Boyle then Taylor to claim a 2-2 draw\n\nA week later at Hampden, in front of 15,000 spectators, the replay took place.  Dick Hunter of St Mirren took Watson's place at full back. Both sides had chances in the first half but neither team could find the net. However within five minutes of the restart Queens were ahead and three more followed before Taylor scored a consolation goal 13 minutes from time.\n\n===February===\nBad winter weather put paid to any play by Dumbarton during February.\n\nSo the positions in the league at the end of the month were unchanged, other than Celtic closing the gap in third \u2013 now 6 points behind with 4 games in hand.\n\n===March===\nA series of international trial matches were held on 5 March to consider selection of teams to represent Scotland in the upcoming Home International Championship - John McLeod, Tom McMillan, Dickie Boyle, John Taylor, John Bell and Willie Thomson all took part.\n\nOn 12 March Dumbarton played their first match in six weeks with a semi final tie in the county cup at home against Methlan Park. A number of second XI players were given starts but the long lay-off did not seem to have done the Sons forwards much harm as they raced to a 4-0 lead by half time. In the second half McLeod, who was taking a rare opportunity to show his outfield skills, joined in the scoring melee with a brace and in the end the game ended in a 9-0 rout.\n\nA week later Dumbarton returned to league duty with a visit to Paisley to play St Mirren. Watson and Taylor were missing, their places taken by Smith and McIndewar. Bell had the Sons two ahead but the Saints got one back before the break. An own goal restored the visitors two goal advantage before the Buddies got another, but it was not enough as Dumbarton ran out 3-2 winners.  \n\nOn 26 March John Taylor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113061 |title=John Taylor|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> and William Thomson<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113073 |title=William Thomson|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> both earned their first caps for Scotland against Wales, with Thomson scoring a goal in the 6-1 win.  At the same time Dumbarton entertained Cambuslang in the league at Boghead. In addition to the internationals, the Sons were also minus McMillan who had decided to retire from the game, and Keir. Bell and Miller put the Sons ahead early but Cambuslang came back to equalise before half time. McLeod, making up for the missing forwards, put Dumbarton ahead again. Another from McLeod and one from Miller made the final score 5-2.\n\nSo having chalked up a further 2 league victories, at the end of March Dumbarton led the table with 32 points with 4 games left to play \u2013 still 5 ahead of Hearts in second \u2013 but more threateningly Celtic in third 9 points behind and with 5 games in hand.\n\n===April===\nOn 2 April John Bell<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113196 |title=John Bell|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>  earned his second cap against England, and John McLeod<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113466 |title=John McLeod|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> earned his fourth cap in the same game, with Bell scoring Scotland's goal in the 4-1 defeat.\n\nA week later Rangers came to Boghead on league business.  Unfortunately the referee from Dundee failed to appear and both teams agreed to a Dumbarton official taking his place. Goals from Boyle(2), Taylor and Bell gave the Sons a 4-1 victory, but immediately after the game Rangers protested the result. Rangers reason for the protest was that \u2018Dumbarton had taken then down too far, and that it would be an extremely nice thing if they could get another chance to show their paces\u2019. The protest was subsequently upheld even though it was the Rangers secretary who had suggested that the Dumbarton referee officiate, however the League censured Rangers for \u2018unsportsmanlike behaviour\u2019.\n\nOn 11 April teams representing the Scottish and English Leagues met at Bolton. John McLeod,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/johnmcleod.html |title=John McLeod - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> Jack Bell,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/johnbell.html |title=John Bell - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> Dickie Boyle<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/richardboyle.html |title=Richard Boyle - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> and John Taylor<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/johndanieltaylor.html |title=John Daniel Taylor - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> all played in the 2-2 draw, in which Bell scored one of the goals. \n\nThe following weekend Dumbarton met Vale of Leven in the Dumbartonshire Cup final at Boghead. A full strength team turned out. Miller had Dumbarton ahead midway through the first half and another goal gained through a scrimmage made the half time score 2-0. There were no further goals and Dumbarton retained the trophy for the fourth successive year.\n\nIn a huge game which would go a long way to deciding the destination of the league title, Celtic visited Dumbarton on 23 April. McDonald was the only change to the side replacing Stewart. A fast and furious game saw no goals by half time but just as it looked as if the game would end in a scoreless draw Miller stepped up to grab the all important goal to provide Dumbarton with a 1-0 win.\n\nHaving taken the massive step of beating their closest challengers, on 30 April Dumbarton travelled to meet Clyde in Glasgow with an unchanged side. In less than a minute Bell had the Sons ahead but it was not to be the easy victory that might have been predicted as Clyde came back with their best performance of the season to record a 4-1 result.\n\nSo April ended with Dumbarton still ahead with 34 points, with 2 games left to play. Hearts had the same number of points but only had one remaining game, whilst Celtic were on 28 points with 4 games left.\n\n===May===\nOn 4 May the re-run of the protested match against Rangers was played at Boghead. An unchanged side apart from Galbraith taking Taylor's place, turned out determined to show that the first game's result had been no fluke. A Bell hat-trick contributed towards a 6-0 thrashing \u2013 not counting another two \u2018goals\u2019 that were disallowed.  This victory ensured a 100% home league record.\n\nThree days later, Dumbarton went into their final league game knowing that a draw at Abercorn would be sufficient to win the title outright. Taylor was back in his place for the match and while the Abbies led at halftime a Thomson goal made the score 1-1 and this is how it finished. Dumbarton champions again!\nOn 14 May Dumbarton fielded their second XI to begin their defence of the Greenock Charity Cup against Dykebar at Cappielow. The Sons had the greater share of the play and ran out 1-0 winners.\n\nThe following weekend Dumbarton turned out at Ibrox to play Celtic in the semi final of the Glasgow Charity Cup. Dick Hunter of St Mirren guested for the Sons. With a strong wind in their favour Dumbarton bossed the first half although it was not until late in the first half that Miller scored the opener. In the second half however the Celts took full advantage of the elements\u2013 and would gain some revenge for losing the league title by recording a 3-1 win.\n\nThe final game of the season took place on 28 May, with the final of the Greenock Charity Cup against Morton at Cappielow. Again a \u2018scratch\u2019 side was played with only McLeod and Galbraith of the full team present and  a strong Morton side recorded a 4-1 victory. \n\nIt was however not the final game for one of the Dumbarton players as on 30 May, a Scottish League XI played a Scottish Alliance XI, with John Miller being selected to play in the 'League' team, scoring twice in the 4-3 win.\n\nOn the same day Dumbarton Rangers won the county Second XI cup with a 6-3 win over Smithston Hibs. With this win the \u2018reserves\u2019 matched the \u2018big\u2019 team by winning a fourth successive county championship.\n\n==Match results==\n===Scottish League===\n{{Main|1891-92 Scottish Football League}}\n{{football box collapsible\n|result  =W\n|date =15 August 1891\n|round =[[1891\u201392 Scottish Football League|Scottish League]]\n|score = 0-2<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/dumbarton/game.php?gameid=38014 |title=Cambuslang 0 -

In addition Dumbarton played in the [[Dumbartonshire Cup]], the [[Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup|Glasgow Charity Cup]] and the Greenock and District Charity Cup.\n\n==Story of the Season==\nDumbarton entered season 1891-92 as the defending league champions, with an almost unchanged side.  The battle between professionalism and amateurism in football still raged, but for now playing for the love of the game still won in Scotland.\n\n===August===\nThe season opened on 8 August with a trip to the borders, where a friendly 3-3 draw was played against 5th KRV.  A further pre-season friendly was played 4 days later at Airdrie \u2013 a 2-0 reverse being suffered.\n\nThe league campaign opened on 15 August, with an away fixture against Cambuslang. The team turned out as follows: McLeod (goal); Watson and McMillan (full backs); Lang, Boyle and keir (half backs); Taylor, Bell.W, Miller.j, Thomson and Bell.J (forwards). Taylor was the first to score for the Sons after 20 minutes and Thomson followed before the interval. The second half was evenly contested and the game finished 2-0.\n\nA week later, the unfurling of the (joint) league champions flag was celebrated at Boghead where Abercorn were the visitors on league duty. The places of Watson, Lang and W.Bell were taken by A.Miller, John Gillan and McNaught respectively. Bell netted his first goal of the season in five minutes and three more followed by half time \u2013 with Abercorn missing a penalty. In the second half it was more of the same with the final score being 8-1.\n\nOn 29 August the two unbeaten sides in the league so far met, as Hearts took on Dumbarton at Tynecastle. A full strength side took to the field as Watson and Galbraith returned to the side. The Sons got off to a good start and an early \u2018goal\u2019 was ruled out for offside. Hearts then came more into the game and scored first, though Dumbarton equalised from an own goal before half time. Early in the second half the visitors \u2018scored\u2019 again but the referee did not see the ball cross the line. Luck wasn't with the Sons and Hearts took advantage with a quick brace, the second being a Miller own goal \u2013 leaving the final score at 3-1.\n\nThe result left Hearts on top of the table, with Dumbarton and Celtic leading the chase 2 points behind.\n\n===September===\nOn 5 September, Dumbarton travelled to Ibrox to play last season's joint champions Rangers in a league fixture. Only one change was made with Thomson coming back in place of Galbraith. The Sons were ahead within 10 minutes from a Taylor goal, and just a minute later the same player made it two, with the hat trick being completed after 15 minutes. Rangers were a disappointing lot and it wasn't till late on that they scored a consolation goal leaving the result at 3-1.\n\nA week later Leith Athletic were visitors to Boghead in their league encounter. Miller failed to appear and was replaced by McDonald with Galbraith coming in for McMillan. Taylor continued his recent goal scoring form by having the Sons two. The other Dumbarton forwards decided to join in the second half with Miller(2); McNaught and Bell completing a 6-0 thrashing.\n\nHearts, the early league pace setters, played their return league fixture against Dumbarton at Boghead on 19 September. Miller and Thomson returned to the side. The Sons were quickest off the mark and McNaught had the home side ahead within nine minutes. Miller and Bell made it three before 15 minutes had passed. Bell then scored again before Hearts got one back \u2013 4-1 after 20 minutes. Understandably the pace of the game dropped and there were no more goals before the interval. Watson had been injured in the first half and had retired for a time, and although he returned in the second half he was clearly unfit. Nevertheless, it was not until two minutes from the final whistle that Miller scored the last goal of the game for a 5-1 thumping.\n\nOn 26 September Dumbarton were at Celtic Park to play off a league fixture. Watson had not recovered from his injury and was replaced by McDonald. Both teams played a fast and exciting game and despite chances falling to both the interval was reached goalless. It only took five minutes however for Celtic to take the lead in the second half and while the Sons had numerous attempts at equalising, they came to nothing and in the end the Celts scored a second just on full-time being called.\n\nSo the end of September still saw Hearts in the lead with 13 points, 3 points ahead of the chasing pack of Celtic, Dumbarton and Leith Athletic.\n\n===October===\nAt the beginning of the season a Canadian international touring side played a series of matches in the UK. One of these was against a Scotland XI on 3 October at Ibrox Park. John McLeod and John Bell played in the 5-1 win for the Scots, with Bell scoring two of the goals.\n\nOn the same day Dumbarton visited county neighbours, Vale of Leven, on league business. In addition to the missing personnel from the representative match Taylor's place was taken by a trialist. A goal from Miller after 40 minutes was all that separated the teams at half time. A penalty brought Vale level but an own goal shortly before the end provided the Sons with a 2-1 win.\n\nA free week was followed on 17 October with a home league fixture against Third Lanark.  McLeod returned to the team but Watson and Bell were absent. Nevertheless, the weakened team played well and goals in each half by Miller were enough for a 2-0 victory.\n\nSt Mirren were the next visitors to Boghead on 24 October where an unchanged side was fielded by Dumbarton. Taylor and Miller (his fourth goal in three games) had the Sons two ahead by the interval. In the second half Taylor scored again before the saints got one back. A converted penalty kick by McMillan made it four before a late St Mirren flurry saw the final score being 4-2.\n\nOn the last day of the month the Sons travelled to Edinburgh to play the return league fixture against Leith Athletic. Bell returned but Taylor and Miller were missing from the team. Bell wasted no time in adding to his goal tally by scoring Dumbarton's first in 10 minutes. This was the position until Leith evened up matters midway through the second half but a McMillan strike and an own goal made the points safe for the Sons in a 3-1 win.\n\nAt the end of the month, with another 4 victories secured, Dumbarton were still in second place with 18 points from 11 games \u2013 a point behind Hearts but crucially 2 games in hand.\n\n===November===\nThe month began with a visit to county neighbours Renton for a league fixture on 7 November. Taylor returned but Galbriaith dropped out. Thomson and McMillan had the Sons two ahead after 35 minutes but Renton got one back before half time. An equaliser was scored midway through the second half but Taylor notched the winner for Dumbarton and another tow points added to the total.\n\nOn 14 November Clyde were visitors to Boghead. Miller returned at centre forward in an otherwise unchanged side. In what became a fairly one-sided match both Bell and Taylor scored hat tricks in an 8-2 thrashing.\n\nThe match against St Mirren on 21 November was postponed as Dumbarton were unable to raise a team due to illness and 2nd XI commitments.\n\nA week later there was a rest from league duty and with the first Scottish Cup encounter.  Much on the prompting of Dumbarton officials, a qualifying process had been introduced to the cup competition, and Dumbarton's first appearance was at the fifth round stage.  Glasgow Thistle were the opponents at Boghead. McLeod and Richmond were unavailable their places taken by Barr and Smith from the Seconds. Thistle held their own until half time but then goals from Taylor, Bell(2) and Miller carried the Sons through to the next round.\n\nAt the end of November the positions in the league saw Hearts lead with 21 points from 14 matches, Dumbarton a point behind but with just 12 games and Celtic in third with 16 points from just 9 games.  \n\n===December===\nDecember began with a league visit to Cathkin Park to play Third Lanark with Dumbarton fielding an unchanged side. Thirds started brightly and were two ahead early on \u2013 and had another disallowed for offside. However two goals from Bell brought the teams level before the break. Early in the second half a Thirds man had to retire injured and the Sons took full advantage of the extra man, with Bell completing his hat trick then McNaught and Thomson completing a 5-2 victory.\n\nOn 12 December, the league fixture against local rivals Vale of Leven was played at Boghead. Watson was a welcome returnee to the team while McDonald took the place of Keir. Conditions were miserable but Dumbarton played much the better. Taylor scored within seconds of the game starting, then Miller, Thomson and McDonald had the home team four ahead by half time. Another four goals had Dumbarton 8-0 in front with 20 minutes of the second half played and with the weather worsening the Vale captain intimated to the referee that the Vale team surrendered the game to the homesters.\n\nA week later it was back to Cathkin Park \u2013 but this time on Scottish Cup duty.  McLeod and Keir returned to the squad. As in the previous game between the sides Thirds were first to show and were a goal ahead after 20 minutes but McNaught got the Sons back on level terms just on half time. Luck once again deserted Thirds as one of their players retired injured and Taylor scored twice to take full advantage of the extra man. Late in the game Bell had to leave the field after being charged by a Thirds man.\n\nThe 26 December saw near neighbours Renton come to Boghead on league duty. Keir was missing from the previous week's team. The game began in atrocious conditions but McNaught had the Sons ahead within 10 minutes. Renton got the equaliser from a scrimmage but before half time Bell made the score 2-1 before half time. Despite efforts from both teams there were no further goals.\n\nThe league positions at the end of the year looked good for Dumbarton \u2013 now ahead with 28 points \u2013 five ahead of Hearts \u2013 but Celtic still posed a real danger, 10 points behind but with 6 games in hand.\n\n===January===\nThe New Year began with a visit to Celtic Park in a friendly. Lang replaced Keir in the team with Richmond coming back in place of Smith. A close contest was expected but from the minute that Taylor had the Sons ahead early on it was one-way traffic. Bell, Taylor again and Thomson(2) made it 5-0 by half time. In the second half it was more of the same with Bell getting his second, then McNaught and finally Taylor completing his hat trick for an 8-0 walloping. \nA day later, Dumbarton met hearts in a friendly at Tynecastle. The only change to the team was the resting of Taylor.  In a complete reversal of roles it was the Edinburgh side who dominated proceedings taking a 5-0 lead by the interval. Thomson saved the Sons blushes with a consolation goal in the second half but Hearts increased their tally by two for a 7-1 trouncing.\n\nThen on 4 January, Dumbarton made the trip up north to face Aberdeen. McLeod and Miller were rested but despite the missing first XI men Dumbarton came away with a fine 6-1 win.\n\nBad weather ensured that little football would be played for most of the month, until 23 January when old rivals Queen's Park came to Boghead for a seventh round Scottish Cup tie. Dumbarton were back to full strength with the return of McLeod. Keir, Taylor and both Millers. Queens opened the scoring after 15 minutes and were two up just before half time. On crossing over the Sons pressed and were rewarded by goals from Boyle then Taylor to claim a 2-2 draw\n\nA week later at Hampden, in front of 15,000 spectators, the replay took place.  Dick Hunter of St Mirren took Watson's place at full back. Both sides had chances in the first half but neither team could find the net. However within five minutes of the restart Queens were ahead and three more followed before Taylor scored a consolation goal 13 minutes from time.\n\n===February===\nBad winter weather put paid to any play by Dumbarton during February.\n\nSo the positions in the league at the end of the month were unchanged, other than Celtic closing the gap in third \u2013 now 6 points behind with 4 games in hand.\n\n===March===\nA series of international trial matches were held on 5 March to consider selection of teams to represent Scotland in the upcoming Home International Championship - John McLeod, Tom McMillan, Dickie Boyle, John Taylor, John Bell and Willie Thomson all took part.\n\nOn 12 March Dumbarton played their first match in six weeks with a semi final tie in the county cup at home against Methlan Park. A number of second XI players were given starts but the long lay-off did not seem to have done the Sons forwards much harm as they raced to a 4-0 lead by half time. In the second half McLeod, who was taking a rare opportunity to show his outfield skills, joined in the scoring melee with a brace and in the end the game ended in a 9-0 rout.\n\nA week later Dumbarton returned to league duty with a visit to Paisley to play St Mirren. Watson and Taylor were missing, their places taken by Smith and McIndewar. Bell had the Sons two ahead but the Saints got one back before the break. An own goal restored the visitors two goal advantage before the Buddies got another, but it was not enough as Dumbarton ran out 3-2 winners.  \n\nOn 26 March John Taylor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113061 |title=John Taylor|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> and William Thomson<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113073 |title=William Thomson|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> both earned their first caps for Scotland against Wales, with Thomson scoring a goal in the 6-1 win.  At the same time Dumbarton entertained Cambuslang in the league at Boghead. In addition to the internationals, the Sons were also minus McMillan who had decided to retire from the game, and Keir. Bell and Miller put the Sons ahead early but Cambuslang came back to equalise before half time. McLeod, making up for the missing forwards, put Dumbarton ahead again. Another from McLeod and one from Miller made the final score 5-2.\n\nSo having chalked up a further 2 league victories, at the end of March Dumbarton led the table with 32 points with 4 games left to play \u2013 still 5 ahead of Hearts in second \u2013 but more threateningly Celtic in third 9 points behind and with 5 games in hand.\n\n===April===\nOn 2 April John Bell<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113196 |title=John Bell|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>  earned his second cap against England, and John McLeod<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/players/?pid=113466 |title=John McLeod|publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> earned his fourth cap in the same game, with Bell scoring Scotland's goal in the 4-1 defeat.\n\nA week later Rangers came to Boghead on league business.  Unfortunately the referee from Dundee failed to appear and both teams agreed to a Dumbarton official taking his place. Goals from Boyle(2), Taylor and Bell gave the Sons a 4-1 victory, but immediately after the game Rangers protested the result. Rangers reason for the protest was that \u2018Dumbarton had taken then down too far, and that it would be an extremely nice thing if they could get another chance to show their paces\u2019. The protest was subsequently upheld even though it was the Rangers secretary who had suggested that the Dumbarton referee officiate, however the League censured Rangers for \u2018unsportsmanlike behaviour\u2019.\n\nOn 11 April teams representing the Scottish and English Leagues met at Bolton. John McLeod,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/johnmcleod.html |title=John McLeod - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> Jack Bell,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/johnbell.html |title=John Bell - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> Dickie Boyle<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/richardboyle.html |title=Richard Boyle - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> and John Taylor<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/johndanieltaylor.html |title=John Daniel Taylor - Scottish Football League |publisher=londonhearts.com|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> all played in the 2-2 draw, in which Bell scored one of the goals. \n\nThe following weekend Dumbarton met Vale of Leven in the Dumbartonshire Cup final at Boghead. A full strength team turned out. Miller had Dumbarton ahead midway through the first half and another goal gained through a scrimmage made the half time score 2-0. There were no further goals and Dumbarton retained the trophy for the fourth successive year.\n\nIn a huge game which would go a long way to deciding the destination of the league title, Celtic visited Dumbarton on 23 April. McDonald was the only change to the side replacing Stewart. A fast and furious game saw no goals by half time but just as it looked as if the game would end in a scoreless draw Miller stepped up to grab the all important goal to provide Dumbarton with a 1-0 win.\n\nHaving taken the massive step of beating their closest challengers, on 30 April Dumbarton travelled to meet Clyde in Glasgow with an unchanged side. In less than a minute Bell had the Sons ahead but it was not to be the easy victory that might have been predicted as Clyde came back with their best performance of the season to record a 4-1 result.\n\nSo April ended with Dumbarton still ahead with 34 points, with 2 games left to play. Hearts had the same number of points but only had one remaining game, whilst Celtic were on 28 points with 4 games left.\n\n===May===\nOn 4 May the re-run of the protested match against Rangers was played at Boghead. An unchanged side apart from Galbraith taking Taylor's place, turned out determined to show that the first game's result had been no fluke. A Bell hat-trick contributed towards a 6-0 thrashing \u2013 not counting another two \u2018goals\u2019 that were disallowed.  This victory ensured a 100% home league record.\n\nThree days later, Dumbarton went into their final league game knowing that a draw at Abercorn would be sufficient to win the title outright. Taylor was back in his place for the match and while the Abbies led at halftime a Thomson goal made the score 1-1 and this is how it finished. Dumbarton champions again!\nOn 14 May Dumbarton fielded their second XI to begin their defence of the Greenock Charity Cup against Dykebar at Cappielow. The Sons had the greater share of the play and ran out 1-0 winners.\n\nThe following weekend Dumbarton turned out at Ibrox to play Celtic in the semi final of the Glasgow Charity Cup. Dick Hunter of St Mirren guested for the Sons. With a strong wind in their favour Dumbarton bossed the first half although it was not until late in the first half that Miller scored the opener. In the second half however the Celts took full advantage of the elements\u2013 and would gain some revenge for losing the league title by recording a 3-1 win.\n\nThe final game of the season took place on 28 May, with the final of the Greenock Charity Cup against Morton at Cappielow. Again a \u2018scratch\u2019 side was played with only McLeod and Galbraith of the full team present and  a strong Morton side recorded a 4-1 victory. \n\nIt was however not the final game for one of the Dumbarton players as on 30 May, a Scottish League XI played a Scottish Alliance XI, with John Miller being selected to play in the 'League' team, scoring twice in the 4-3 win.\n\nOn the same day Dumbarton Rangers won the county Second XI cup with a 6-3 win over Smithston Hibs. With this win the \u2018reserves\u2019 matched the \u2018big\u2019 team by winning a fourth successive county championship.\n\n==Match results==\n===Scottish League===\n{{Main|1891-92 Scottish Football League}}\n{{football box collapsible\n|result  =W\n|date =15 August 1891\n|round =[[1891\u201392 Scottish Football League|Scottish League]]\n|score = 0-2<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/dumbarton/game.php?gameid=38014 |title=Cambuslang 0 -

The liquid-fueled H-IIA [[rocket]]s have been used to launch [[satellite]]s into [[geostationary orbit]], to launch a lunar orbiting spacecraft, and to launch ''[[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|Akatsuki]]'', which studied the planet Venus. Launches occur at the [[Tanegashima Space Center]]. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. {{As of|2020|02}}, H-IIA rockets were launched 41 times,<!-- UPDATE after each flight --> including 35 consecutive missions<!-- UPDATE after each flight --> without a failure, dating back to November 29, 2003.\n\nProduction and management of the H-IIA shifted from JAXA to MHI on April 1, 2007. Flight 13, which launched the lunar orbiter [[SELENE]], was the first H-IIA launched after this privatization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4356/ |title=Mitsubishi and Arianespace Combine Commercial Satellite Launch Services |publisher=SatNews |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208014829/http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4356/ |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe H-IIA is a derivative of the earlier [[H-II]] rocket, substantially redesigned to improve reliability and minimize costs. There are currently two (formerly four) different variants of the H-IIA in active service for various purposes.  A derivative design, the [[H-IIB]], was developed in the 2000s and made its [[maiden flight]] in 2009.\n\n== Vehicle description ==\nThe launch capability of an H-IIA launch vehicle can be enhanced by adding [[SRB-A]] ([[solid rocket booster]] or SRB) and [[Castor (rocket stage)|Castor 4AXL]] (solid strap-on booster or SSB) to its basic configuration, creating a \"family\". The models are indicated by three or four numbers following the prefix \"H2A\". The first number in the sequence indicates the number of stages; the second number of [[liquid rocket booster]]s (LRBs); the third number of SRBs; and, if present, the fourth number shows the number of SSBs.<ref name=\"leaflet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/pr/brochure/pdf/01/rocket01.pdf |title=H-IIA Launch Vehicle |accessdate=2007-09-15 |format=PDF |publisher=JAXA |pages=2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228013323/http://www.jaxa.jp/pr/brochure/pdf/01/rocket01.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-28 }}</ref> The first two figures are virtually fixed at \"20\", as H-IIA is always two-staged, and the plans for LRBs were cancelled and superseded by the [[H-IIB]].\n\n== Variants ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

JAXA announced that launches would resume in 2005, and the first successful flight took place on February 26 with the launch of [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite|MTSAT-1R]].\n\nThe first launch for a mission beyond Earth orbit was on September 14, 2007 for the [[SELENE]] moon mission. The first foreign payload on the H-IIA was the Australian FedSat-1 in 2002. As of March 2015, 27 out of 28 launches were successful.\n\nA rocket with increased launch capabilities, [[H-IIB]], is a derivative of the H-IIA family. H-IIB uses two LE-7A engines in its first stage, as opposed to one in H-IIA. The first H-IIB was successfully launched on September 10, 2009.\n\nFor the 29th flight on November 24, 2015, an H-IIA with an upgraded second stage<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/11/20151124_h2af29.html|title=Launch Result of Telstar 12 VANTAGE by H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 29|publisher=JAXA|date=24 Nov 2015|accessdate=30 Nov 2015}}</ref> launched the Canadian Telstar 12V satellite, the first commercial primary payload for a Japanese launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/11/japanese-h-iia-telstar-12v-launch/|title=Japanese H-IIA successfully lofts Telstar 12V|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=William Graham|date=23 Nov 2015|accessdate=30 Nov 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The liquid-fueled H-IIA [[rocket]]s have been used to launch [[satellite]]s into [[geostationary orbit]], to launch a lunar orbiting spacecraft, and to launch ''[[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|Akatsuki]]'', which studied the planet Venus. Launches occur at the [[Tanegashima Space Center]]. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. {{As of|2020|02}}, H-IIA rockets were launched 41 times,<!-- UPDATE after each flight --> including 35 consecutive missions<!-- UPDATE after each flight --> without a failure, dating back to November 29, 2003.\n\nProduction and management of the H-IIA shifted from JAXA to MHI on April 1, 2007. Flight 13, which launched the lunar orbiter [[SELENE]], was the first H-IIA launched after this privatization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4356/ |title=Mitsubishi and Arianespace Combine Commercial Satellite Launch Services |publisher=SatNews |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208014829/http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4356/ |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe H-IIA is a derivative of the earlier [[H-II]] rocket, substantially redesigned to improve reliability and minimize costs. There are currently two (formerly four) different variants of the H-IIA in active service for various purposes.  A derivative design, the [[H-IIB]], was developed in the 2000s and made its [[maiden flight]] in 2009.\n\n== Vehicle description ==\nThe launch capability of an H-IIA launch vehicle can be enhanced by adding [[SRB-A]] ([[solid rocket booster]] or SRB) and [[Castor (rocket stage)|Castor 4AXL]] (solid strap-on booster or SSB) to its basic configuration, creating a \"family\". The models are indicated by three or four numbers following the prefix \"H2A\".

JAXA announced that launches would resume in 2005, and the first successful flight took place on February 26 with the launch of [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite|MTSAT-1R]].\n\nThe first launch for a mission beyond Earth orbit was on September 14, 2007 for the [[SELENE]] moon mission. The first foreign payload on the H-IIA was the Australian FedSat-1 in 2002. As of March 2015, 27 out of 28 launches were successful.\n\nA rocket with increased launch capabilities, [[H-IIB]], is a derivative of the H-IIA family. H-IIB uses two LE-7A engines in its first stage, as opposed to one in H-IIA. The first H-IIB was successfully launched on September 10, 2009.\n\nFor the 29th flight on November 24, 2015, an H-IIA with an upgraded second stage<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/11/20151124_h2af29.html|title=Launch Result of Telstar 12 VANTAGE by H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 29|publisher=JAXA|date=24 Nov 2015|accessdate=30 Nov 2015}}</ref> launched the Canadian Telstar 12V satellite, the first commercial primary payload for a Japanese launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/11/japanese-h-iia-telstar-12v-launch/|title=Japanese H-IIA successfully lofts Telstar 12V|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=William Graham|date=23 Nov 2015|accessdate=30 Nov 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Mafia's origins are still uncertain, but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th century initially in the role of private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of [[bandits]] (''Briganti'') who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns. The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The [[Carabinieri]] (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the [[Regio Esercito|Italian army]] were often involved in terrible fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret co-operation between the mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111034455/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Ieri/Storia/Vista%2Bda/Fascicolo%2B22/01_Fascicolo%2B22.htm Arma dei Carabinieri \u2013 Home \u2013 L'Arma \u2013 Ieri \u2013 Storia \u2013 Vista da \u2013 Fascicolo 22].

About five million people live in Sicily, making it the [[List of regions of Italy#List of regions|fourth most populated region in Italy]]. In the first century after the [[Italian unification]], Sicily had one of the most negative [[net migration rate]]s among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia.

South Italian and Sicilian emigration started shortly after the Unification of Italy and has not stopped ever since.

In Sicily, the first coastal towers date back to 1313 and 1345 of the Aragonese monarchy. From 1360 the threat came from the south, from [[North Africa]] to [[Maghreb]], mainly to [[Barbary pirates]] and corsairs of [[Barbary Coast]]. In 1516, the Turks settled in [[Algiers]], and from 1520, the corsair [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] under the command of [[Ottoman Empire]], operated from that harbor.\n\nMost existing towers were built on architectural designs of the Florentine architect [[Camillo Camilliani]] from [1583] to 1584 and involved the coastal periple of Sicily. The typology changed completely in '800, because of the new higher fire volumes of cannon vessels, the towers were built on the type of [[Martello towers]] that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire. \nThe decline of Mediterranean piracy caused by the [[Second Barbary War]] led to a smaller number of coastal towers built during the 19th Century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=Scott |title=Sicilian Castles and Coastal Towers |date=2017 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Albuquerque |pages=318,319--329 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35190827 |accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref> \n<gallery>\nFile:Torre-Capo-Rama-bjs.jpg|Torre-Capo-Rama ([[Terrasini]])\nFile:Altavilla Milicia BW 2012-10-08 18-04-22 b.JPG|Torre di ([[Altavilla Milicia]])\nFile:Torre dello Spalmatore - Ustica.jpg|Torre Spalmatore ([[Ustica]])\nFile:D7A 1568 bis Torre Pozzillo.jpg|Torre Pozzillo ([[Cinisi]])\nFile:Ligny Tower - Trapani.jpg|[[Ligny Tower]] - ([[Trapani]])\nFile:Trapani.jpg|Torre Nubia ([[Paceco]])\nFile:Torre di Manfria (Gela).jpg|Torre [[Manfria]] ([[Gela]])\nFile:Torre Cabrera, Marina di Ragusa.jpg|[[Torre Cabrera (Marina di Ragusa)]] ([[Marina di Ragusa]])\nFile:Pozzallo-TorreCabrera.JPG|[[Torre Cabrera (Pozzallo)]] ([[Pozzallo]])\nFile:Vignazzi Tower.JPG|[[Vignazza Tower]] ([[Giardini Naxos]])\n</gallery>\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|List of museums in Sicily}}\n{{Quote|text=To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.|sign=[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art149.htm|title=Goethe in Sicily - Best of Sicily Magazine|website=www.bestofsicily.com}}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}}}\n[[File:Antonello da Messina - Virgin Annunciate - Galleria Regionale della Sicilia, Palermo.jpg|thumb|[[Virgin Annunciate (Antonello da Messina, Palermo)|''Virgin Annunciate'']], [[Antonello da Messina]]]]\nSicily has long been associated with [[the arts]]; many poets, writers, [[philosophy|philosophers]], intellectuals, architects and painters have roots on the island.

[[Noto]], [[Caltagirone]], [[Catania]], [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]], [[Modica]], [[Scicli]] and particularly [[Acireale]] contain some of Italy's best examples of [[Baroque architecture]], carved in the local red [[sandstone]]. Noto provides one of the best examples of the Baroque architecture brought to Sicily.\nThe Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and [[palazzo|palazzi]] built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy.<ref>\"Palazzo\" ''(pl. palazzi)'': is any large building in a town, state or private (often much smaller than the term ''palace'' implies in the [[English-speaking world]]). While ''palazzo'' is the technically correct appellation and postal address, no Sicilian aristocrat would ever use the word, instead referring to his or her own house, however large, as \"casa\". \"Palazzo\" followed by the family name was the term used by officials, tradesmen, and delivery men. Gefen, p. 15.</ref> The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, [[Florence]], and [[Naples]]. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterize in words.\n\n===Music and film===\n{{See also|Music of Sicily}}\n[[File:Palermo teatro massimo.jpg|thumb|[[Teatro Massimo]], [[Palermo]]]]\n[[Palermo]] hosts the [[Teatro Massimo]] which is the largest [[opera house]] in Italy and the third largest in all of Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://selectitaly.com/theater.php?product_id=6 |publisher=SelectItaly.com |title=Teatro Massimo in Palermo |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>\nIn [[Catania]] there is another important [[opera house]], the [[Teatro Massimo Bellini]] with 1,200 seats, which is considered one of the best European [[opera houses]] for its acoustics.\nSicily's composers vary from [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Sigismondo d'India]], [[Giovanni Pacini]] and [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], to contemporary composers such as [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] and [[Silvio Amato]].\n[[File:Vincenzo bellini.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Vincenzo Bellini]]]]\n[[File:Alessandro_Scarlatti.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Alessandro Scarlatti]]]]\nMany award-winning and acclaimed films of Italian cinema have been filmed in Sicily, amongst the most noted of which are: [[Luchino Visconti|Visconti]]'s ''\"[[La Terra Trema]]\"'' and ''\"[[Il Gattopardo]]\"'', [[Pietro Germi]]'s ''\"[[Divorce, Italian Style|Divorzio all'Italiana]]''\" and ''\"[[Seduced and Abandoned|Sedotta e Abbandonata]]''\".\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|Italian Literature|Sicilian School}}\n[[File:Luigi Pirandello.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Luigi Pirandello]]]]\nThe golden age of Sicilian poetry began in the early 13th century with the [[Sicilian School]] of [[Giacomo da Lentini]], which was highly influential on [[Italian literature]].

It is normally concluded on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], often highlighted by the arrival of the [[magi]] on horseback.\n\nOral tradition plays a large role in Sicilian folklore. Many stories passed down from generation to generation involve a character named \"[[Giuf\u00e0]]\". Anecdotes from this character's life preserve Sicilian culture as well as convey moral messages.\n\nSicilians also enjoy outdoor festivals, held in the local square or ''piazza'' where live music and dancing are performed on stage, and food fairs or ''sagre'' are set up in booths lining the square. These offer various local specialties, as well as typical Sicilian food. Normally these events are concluded with fireworks. A noted ''sagra'' is the ''Sagra del Carciofo'' or ''[[Artichoke]] Festival'', which is held annually in [[Ramacca]] in April. The most important traditional event in Sicily is the [[carnival]].

The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional [[puppet theatre]]s featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of ''cantastor\u00ee'' (singers of tales) are rooted in the Proven\u00e7al [[troubadour]] tradition in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century.

The triskeles symbol came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during [[World War II]] when [[Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile]] led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The colours, likewise introduced in the 1940s, respectively represent the cities of [[Palermo]] and [[Corleone]]. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the center of it. When [[World War II]] ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic. \n\nThe flag became the official public flag of the ''Regione Siciliana'' in January 2000, after the passing of an apposite regional law which advocates its use on public buildings, schools and city halls along with the national [[Flag of Italy|Italian flag]] and the [[flag of EU|European]] one.\n\nFamiliar as an ancient symbol of the region, the [[Triskelion]] is also featured on Greek coins of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], such as coins of [[Agathocles]] (317\u2013289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of [[Magna Graecia]], the colonial extension of [[Greece]] beyond the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].<ref name=\"naples\">Matthews, Jeff (2005) [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm Symbols of Naples] {{ webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030202145/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm | date = 30 October 2009 }}</ref> The triskelion was revived, as a [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]] \u2013 and non-[[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] \u2013 emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the [[Two Sicilies]], by [[Joachim Murat]] in 1808.

The interior mountains, especially Nebrodi, Madonie, and Etna, enjoy a full mountain climate, with heavy snowfalls during winter. The summit of Mount Etna is usually snow-capped from October to May.\n\nOn the other hand, especially in the summer, it is not unusual that there is the [[sirocco]], the wind from the Sahara. Rainfall is scarce, and water proves deficient in some provinces where a water crisis can happen occasionally.\n\nAccording to the Regional Agency for Waste and Water, on 10 August 1999, the weather station of [[Catenanuova]] (EN) recorded a maximum temperature of {{convert|48.5|C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Agenzia Regionale per i Rifiuti e le Acque|publisher=Osservatorio delle Acque|url=http://www.osservatorioacque.it/dati/ANNALI/A_1999/PI_80.HTML|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref> The official European record \u2013 measured by minimum/maximum thermometers \u2013 is held by Athens, Greece, which reported a maximum of {{convert|48.0|C|0|abbr=on}} in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wmo.asu.edu/content/europe-highest-temperature|title=WMO Region VI (Europe, Continent only): Highest Temperature|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref> Total precipitation is highly variable, generally increasing with elevation.

The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The [[Carabinieri]] (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the [[Regio Esercito|Italian army]] were often involved in terrible fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret co-operation between the mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111034455/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Ieri/Storia/Vista%2Bda/Fascicolo%2B22/01_Fascicolo%2B22.htm Arma dei Carabinieri \u2013 Home \u2013 L'Arma \u2013 Ieri \u2013 Storia \u2013 Vista da \u2013 Fascicolo 22].

Retrieved on 18 December 2012.</ref> From 1943 to 1951 there was also a [[separatism|separatist]] political party called [[Sicilian Independence Movement]] (''Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano'', MIS). Its best electoral result was in the [[Italian general election, 1946|1946 general election]], when MIS obtained 0.7% of national votes (8.8% of votes in Sicily), and four seats. However, the movement lost all its seats following the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 general election]] and the 1951 regional election. Even though it has never been formally disbanded, today the movement is no longer part of the [[politics of Sicily]]. After [[World War II]] Sicily became a stronghold of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], in opposition to the [[Italian Communist Party]]. The [[Italian Communist Party|Communists]] and their successors (the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], the [[Democrats of the Left]] and the present-day [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]) had never won in the region until [[Sicilian regional election, 2012|2012]].

In 1516, the Turks settled in [[Algiers]], and from 1520, the corsair [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] under the command of [[Ottoman Empire]], operated from that harbor.\n\nMost existing towers were built on architectural designs of the Florentine architect [[Camillo Camilliani]] from [1583] to 1584 and involved the coastal periple of Sicily. The typology changed completely in '800, because of the new higher fire volumes of cannon vessels, the towers were built on the type of [[Martello towers]] that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire. \nThe decline of Mediterranean piracy caused by the [[Second Barbary War]] led to a smaller number of coastal towers built during the 19th Century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=Scott |title=Sicilian Castles and Coastal Towers |date=2017 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Albuquerque |pages=318,319--329 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35190827 |accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref> \n<gallery>\nFile:Torre-Capo-Rama-bjs.jpg|Torre-Capo-Rama ([[Terrasini]])\nFile:Altavilla Milicia BW 2012-10-08 18-04-22 b.JPG|Torre di ([[Altavilla Milicia]])\nFile:Torre dello Spalmatore - Ustica.jpg|Torre Spalmatore ([[Ustica]])\nFile:D7A 1568 bis Torre Pozzillo.jpg|Torre Pozzillo ([[Cinisi]])\nFile:Ligny Tower - Trapani.jpg|[[Ligny Tower]] - ([[Trapani]])\nFile:Trapani.jpg|Torre Nubia ([[Paceco]])\nFile:Torre di Manfria (Gela).jpg|Torre [[Manfria]] ([[Gela]])\nFile:Torre Cabrera, Marina di Ragusa.jpg|[[Torre Cabrera (Marina di Ragusa)]] ([[Marina di Ragusa]])\nFile:Pozzallo-TorreCabrera.JPG|[[Torre Cabrera (Pozzallo)]] ([[Pozzallo]])\nFile:Vignazzi Tower.JPG|[[Vignazza Tower]] ([[Giardini Naxos]])\n</gallery>\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|List of museums in Sicily}}\n{{Quote|text=To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.|sign=[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art149.htm|title=Goethe in Sicily - Best of Sicily Magazine|website=www.bestofsicily.com}}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}}}\n[[File:Antonello da Messina - Virgin Annunciate - Galleria Regionale della Sicilia, Palermo.jpg|thumb|[[Virgin Annunciate (Antonello da Messina, Palermo)|''Virgin Annunciate'']], [[Antonello da Messina]]]]\nSicily has long been associated with [[the arts]]; many poets, writers, [[philosophy|philosophers]], intellectuals, architects and painters have roots on the island.

Noto provides one of the best examples of the Baroque architecture brought to Sicily.\nThe Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and [[palazzo|palazzi]] built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy.<ref>\"Palazzo\" ''(pl. palazzi)'': is any large building in a town, state or private (often much smaller than the term ''palace'' implies in the [[English-speaking world]]). While ''palazzo'' is the technically correct appellation and postal address, no Sicilian aristocrat would ever use the word, instead referring to his or her own house, however large, as \"casa\". \"Palazzo\" followed by the family name was the term used by officials, tradesmen, and delivery men. Gefen, p. 15.</ref> The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, [[Florence]], and [[Naples]]. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterize in words.\n\n===Music and film===\n{{See also|Music of Sicily}}\n[[File:Palermo teatro massimo.jpg|thumb|[[Teatro Massimo]], [[Palermo]]]]\n[[Palermo]] hosts the [[Teatro Massimo]] which is the largest [[opera house]] in Italy and the third largest in all of Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://selectitaly.com/theater.php?product_id=6 |publisher=SelectItaly.com |title=Teatro Massimo in Palermo |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>\nIn [[Catania]] there is another important [[opera house]], the [[Teatro Massimo Bellini]] with 1,200 seats, which is considered one of the best European [[opera houses]] for its acoustics.\nSicily's composers vary from [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Sigismondo d'India]], [[Giovanni Pacini]] and [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], to contemporary composers such as [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] and [[Silvio Amato]].\n[[File:Vincenzo bellini.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Vincenzo Bellini]]]]\n[[File:Alessandro_Scarlatti.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Alessandro Scarlatti]]]]\nMany award-winning and acclaimed films of Italian cinema have been filmed in Sicily, amongst the most noted of which are: [[Luchino Visconti|Visconti]]'s ''\"[[La Terra Trema]]\"'' and ''\"[[Il Gattopardo]]\"'', [[Pietro Germi]]'s ''\"[[Divorce, Italian Style|Divorzio all'Italiana]]''\" and ''\"[[Seduced and Abandoned|Sedotta e Abbandonata]]''\".\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|Italian Literature|Sicilian School}}\n[[File:Luigi Pirandello.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Luigi Pirandello]]]]\nThe golden age of Sicilian poetry began in the early 13th century with the [[Sicilian School]] of [[Giacomo da Lentini]], which was highly influential on [[Italian literature]].
