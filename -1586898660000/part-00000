Russia established direct rule of Chechnya in May 2000 and after the full-scale [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], Chechen militant [[Resistance movement|resistance]] throughout the North Caucasus region continued to inflict heavy Russian casualties and challenge Russian political control over Chechnya for several more years. Some Chechen separatists also carried out attacks against civilians in Russia. [[Second Chechen War crimes and terrorism|These attacks]], as well as widespread human rights violations by Russian and separatist forces, drew international condemnation.\n\nIn mid-2000, the Russian government transferred certain military operations to pro-Russian Chechen forces. The military phase of operations was terminated in April 2002, and the coordination of the field operations were given first to the [[Federal Security Service]] and then to the [[MVD]] in the summer of 2003.\n\nBy 2009, Russia had severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement and large-scale fighting ceased. Russian army and interior ministry troops no longer occupied the streets. Grozny underwent reconstruction efforts and much of the city and surrounding areas were rebuilt quickly.

The Russian [[Terek Cossack Host]] was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free [[Cossacks]] who were resettled from the [[Volga]] to the [[Terek River]]. In 1783, Russia and the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], under which Kartl-Kakheti became a Russian [[protectorate]]. To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the [[Transcaucasia]], the [[Russian Empire]] began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the [[Caucasus War]] in 1817. Russian forces first moved into [[Highland (geography)|highland]] Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under [[Aleksandr Baryatinsky|General Baryatinsky]] broke down the highlanders' resistance. Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u201378]].\n\n===Soviet Union===\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Chechens established a short-lived [[Caucasian Imamate]] which included parts of Chechnya, [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]]; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]].<ref>Armstrong, Patrick. \"Conflict in Chechnya: A Background Perspective.\" ''Journal of Conflict Studies.''

Then, months before the creation of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Chechen Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Russian SFSR]] was established. It annexed a part of territory of the former [[Terek Cossack Host]]. Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia formed the [[Chechen\u2013Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1936. In 1941, during World War II, a Chechen [[1940-1944 Chechnya insurgency|revolt]] broke out, led by [[Khasan Israilov]]. Chechens were accused by [[Joseph Stalin]] of aiding [[Nazism|Nazi]] forces. In February 1944 Stalin [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|deported all]] the Chechens and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] to the [[Kazakh SSR|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz SSR]]s. Up to a quarter of these people died during the \"resettlement.\"<ref>In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and [[Chechen people]] (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia.'' Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929\u20131953.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C.

The debate over independence ultimately led to a small-scale civil war since 1992, in which the Russians supported the opposition forces against [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]]. Thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians) fled the Chechen Republic, and Chechnya's industrial production began failing after Russian engineers and workers fled or were expelled. The [[First Chechen War]] began in 1994, when Russian forces entered Chechnya to \"restore constitutional order\".

Some Chechen separatists also carried out attacks against civilians in Russia. [[Second Chechen War crimes and terrorism|These attacks]], as well as widespread human rights violations by Russian and separatist forces, drew international condemnation.\n\nIn mid-2000, the Russian government transferred certain military operations to pro-Russian Chechen forces. The military phase of operations was terminated in April 2002, and the coordination of the field operations were given first to the [[Federal Security Service]] and then to the [[MVD]] in the summer of 2003.\n\nBy 2009, Russia had severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement and large-scale fighting ceased. Russian army and interior ministry troops no longer occupied the streets. Grozny underwent reconstruction efforts and much of the city and surrounding areas were rebuilt quickly.

The Russian [[Terek Cossack Host]] was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free [[Cossacks]] who were resettled from the [[Volga]] to the [[Terek River]]. In 1783, Russia and the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], under which Kartl-Kakheti became a Russian [[protectorate]]. To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the [[Transcaucasia]], the [[Russian Empire]] began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the [[Caucasus War]] in 1817. Russian forces first moved into [[Highland (geography)|highland]] Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under [[Aleksandr Baryatinsky|General Baryatinsky]] broke down the highlanders' resistance. Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u201378]].\n\n===Soviet Union===\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Chechens established a short-lived [[Caucasian Imamate]] which included parts of Chechnya, [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]]; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]].<ref>Armstrong, Patrick. \"Conflict in Chechnya: A Background Perspective.\" ''Journal of Conflict Studies.''

Then, months before the creation of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Chechen Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Russian SFSR]] was established. It annexed a part of territory of the former [[Terek Cossack Host]]. Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia formed the [[Chechen\u2013Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1936. In 1941, during World War II, a Chechen [[1940-1944 Chechnya insurgency|revolt]] broke out, led by [[Khasan Israilov]]. Chechens were accused by [[Joseph Stalin]] of aiding [[Nazism|Nazi]] forces. In February 1944 Stalin [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|deported all]] the Chechens and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] to the [[Kazakh SSR|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz SSR]]s. Up to a quarter of these people died during the \"resettlement.\"<ref>In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and [[Chechen people]] (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia.'' Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929\u20131953.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C.

In August and September 1999, [[Shamil Basayev]] (in association with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]]-born [[Ibn al-Khattab]], Commander of the Mujahedeen) led two armies of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab and international [[mujahideen]] and Wahhabist militants from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan.

Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total nearly 300 people were killed. A criminal investigation of the bombings was completed in 2002. The results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by [[Achemez Gochiyaev]], who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and [[Abu Omar al-Saif]] (both of whom were later killed), in retaliation for the Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan.

Hoping to avoid the significant casualties that plagued the first Chechen War, the Russians advanced slowly and in force, making extensive use of [[artillery]] and [[air power]] in an attempt to soften Chechen defences. Many thousands of civilians fled the Russian advance, leaving Chechnya for neighbouring Russian republics. Their numbers were later estimated to reach 200,000 to 350,000, out of the approximately 800,000 residents of the Chechen Republic. The Russians appeared to be taking no chances with the Chechen population in its rear areas, setting up \"[[filtration camp system in Chechnya|filtration camps]]\" in October in northern Chechnya for detaining suspected members of ''bandformirovaniya'' militant formations (literally: \"bandit formations\").\n\nOn 15 October 1999, Russian forces took control of a strategic ridge within artillery range of the Chechen capital Grozny after mounting an intense tank and artillery barrage against Chechen fighters.
