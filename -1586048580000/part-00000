With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines.

The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|number=194|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night. Wellington, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|The southern terminus of the North Island Main Trunk, [[Wellington railway station]], and busiest station in the Wellington suburban network.]]\n{{main|Public transport in Wellington}}\n\nWellington's Metlink suburban network, operated by [[Transdev Wellington]], includes the southern portion of the NIMT between [[Wellington railway station, New Zealand|Wellington]] and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] as the [[Kapiti Line]].\n\n==Stations==\n\n<ref>{{cite book|title=New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas|year=1965|publisher=Quail Map Co.|pages=3 & 4|edition=First}}</ref>{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=289\u2013290}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=00288624|volume=45 no. 1|number=194|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

Among Sangam literature, ''[[Mathuraikkanci]]'' refers to women singing ''sevvazhi pann'' to invoke the mercy of God during childbirth. In ''[[Tolkappiyam]]'', the five [[Sangam landscape|landscapes]] of the Sangam literature had each an associated ''Pann'', each describing the mood of the song associated with that landscape.

The basic concepts of this music includes ''[[Shruti (music)|shruti]]'' (microtones), ''[[swaras]]'' (notes), ''[[alankar]]'' (ornamentations), ''[[raga]]'' (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' (rhythmic patterns used in percussion).

It originated in South India during the rule of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] through the Keerthanas composed by [[Purandara Dasa]]. Like Hindustani music, it is [[Melodic music|melodic]], with improvised variations, but tends to have more fixed compositions. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of ''[[Alapana|Raga Alapana]]'', ''[[Kalpanaswaram]]'', ''[[Niraval|Neraval]]'' and, in the case of more advanced students, Raga, Tala, Pallavi. The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as ''g\u0101yaki''). Around 300 [[raga]]ms are in use today.\n[[Annamayya]] is the first known composer in Carnatic music. He is widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha (Godfather of Telugu song-writing).\n[[Purandara Dasa]] is considered the father of Carnatic music, while the later musicians [[Tyagaraja]], [[Shyama Shastry]] and [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] are considered the trinity of Carnatic music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nNoted artists of Carnatic music include [[Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar]] (the father of the current concert format), [[Palghat Mani Iyer]], [[Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer]], [[Nedunuri Krishnamurthy]] [[Alathur Brothers]], [[MS Subbulakshmi]], [[Lalgudi Jayaraman]], [[Balamuralikrishna]], [[TN Seshagopalan]], [[K J Yesudas]], [[N.

It diverged from Carnatic music around the 13th\u201314th centuries CE, primarily due to Islamic influences.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic philosophy]] and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] performance practices of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]]. Classical genres are [[dhrupad]], [[dhamar (music)|dhamar]], [[khyal]], [[tarana]] and [[sadra (music)|sadra]], and there are also several semi-classical forms.\n\n===Light classical music===\nThere are many types of music which comes under the category of light classical or semi-classical.

International shortwave radio stations such as The Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Ceylon played a major part in bringing Western pop, folk, and rock music to the masses. Indian rock bands began to gain prominence only much later, around the late 1980s.\n\nIt was around this time that the rock band [[Indus Creed]] formerly known as The Rock Machine got itself noticed on the international stage with hits like ''Rock N Roll Renegade''. Other bands quickly followed. With the introduction of MTV in the early 1990s, Indians began to be exposed to various forms of rock such as grunge and speed metal, impacting the national scene. The cities of the North Eastern Region, mainly Guwahati and [[Shillong]], [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]] have emerged as major melting pots for rock and metal enthusiasts.

Among Sangam literature, ''[[Mathuraikkanci]]'' refers to women singing ''sevvazhi pann'' to invoke the mercy of God during childbirth. In ''[[Tolkappiyam]]'', the five [[Sangam landscape|landscapes]] of the Sangam literature had each an associated ''Pann'', each describing the mood of the song associated with that landscape. Among the numerous ''panns'' that find mention in the ancient Tamil literature are, ''Ambal Pann'', which is suitable to be played on the flute, ''sevvazhi pann'' on the ''Yazh'' (lute), ''Nottiram'' and ''Sevvazhi'' expressing pathos, the captivating ''Kurinji pann'' and the invigorating ''Murudappann''. \n[[Pann]]({{lang-ta|\u0baa\u0ba3\u0bcd}}) is the melodic mode used by the [[Tamil people]] in [[Ancient Tamil music|their music]] since the ancient times.

The basic concepts of this music includes ''[[Shruti (music)|shruti]]'' (microtones), ''[[swaras]]'' (notes), ''[[alankar]]'' (ornamentations), ''[[raga]]'' (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' (rhythmic patterns used in percussion). Its tonal system divides the octave into 22 segments called Shrutis, not all equal but each roughly equal to a quarter of a whole tone of the Western music.\n\n[[Sangeet Natak Academy]] recognizes eight classical dance and music forms, namely [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Odissi]], [[Kathakali]], [[Sattriya]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]] and [[Mohiniyattam]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Bishnupriya Dutt |author2=Urmimala Sarkar Munsi |title=Engendering Performance: Indian Women Performers in Search of an Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNaGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA216 |year=2010 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-321-0612-8 |page=216}}</ref> Additionally, India's [[Ministry of Culture]] also includes [[Chhau dance|Chhau]] in its classical list.\n\n===Carnatic music===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main|Carnatic music}}\n\nCarnatic music can be traced to the 14th - 15th centuries AD and thereafter. It originated in South India during the rule of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] through the Keerthanas composed by [[Purandara Dasa]]. Like Hindustani music, it is [[Melodic music|melodic]], with improvised variations, but tends to have more fixed compositions. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of ''[[Alapana|Raga Alapana]]'', ''[[Kalpanaswaram]]'', ''[[Niraval|Neraval]]'' and, in the case of more advanced students, Raga, Tala, Pallavi. The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as ''g\u0101yaki''). Around 300 [[raga]]ms are in use today.\n[[Annamayya]] is the first known composer in Carnatic music. He is widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha (Godfather of Telugu song-writing).\n[[Purandara Dasa]] is considered the father of Carnatic music, while the later musicians [[Tyagaraja]], [[Shyama Shastry]] and [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] are considered the trinity of Carnatic music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nNoted artists of Carnatic music include [[Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar]] (the father of the current concert format), [[Palghat Mani Iyer]], [[Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer]], [[Nedunuri Krishnamurthy]] [[Alathur Brothers]], [[MS Subbulakshmi]], [[Lalgudi Jayaraman]], [[Balamuralikrishna]], [[TN Seshagopalan]], [[K J Yesudas]], [[N.

It diverged from Carnatic music around the 13th-14th centuries CE, primarily due to Islamic influences.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic philosophy]] and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] performance practices of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]]. Classical genres are [[dhrupad]], [[dhamar (music)|dhamar]], [[khyal]], [[tarana]] and [[sadra (music)|sadra]], and there are also several semi-classical forms.\n\n===Light classical music===\nThere are many types of music which comes under the category of light classical or semi-classical. Some of the forms are [[Thumri]], [[Dadra]], [[Bhajan]], [[Ghazal]], [[Chaiti]], [[Kajri]], [[Tappa]], [[Natya Sangeet]] and [[Qawwali]]. These forms place emphasis on explicitly seeking emotion from the audience, as opposed to the classical forms.\n\n==Folk music==\n[[File:Hira Devi Waiba.jpg|thumb|Hira Devi Waiba, pioneer of Nepali folk songs in India]]\n[[File:Jodhpur RIFF.jpg|right|thumb|Group of Dharohar [[Indian folk music|folk music]]ians performing in [[Mehrangarh Fort]], [[Jodhpur]], India]]\n{{Main|Indian folk music}}\n\n===Bhangra and Giddha===\n{{main | Music of Punjab}}\n\n[[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: \u0a2d\u0a70\u0a17\u0a5c\u0a3e) is a form of [[dance]]-oriented [[folk music]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]].

International shortwave radio stations such as The Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Ceylon played a major part in bringing Western pop, folk, and rock music to the masses. Indian rock bands began to gain prominence only much later, around the late 1980s.\n\nIt was around this time that the rock band [[Indus Creed]] formerly known as The Rock Machine got itself noticed on the international stage with hits like ''Rock N Roll Renegade''. Other bands quickly followed. With the introduction of MTV in the early 1990s, Indians began to be exposed to various forms of rock such as grunge and speed metal, impacting the national scene. The cities of the North Eastern Region, mainly Guwahati and [[Shillong]], [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]] have emerged as major melting pots for rock and metal enthusiasts.

In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the [[anode]] by the [[electric field]] in the tube.\n\nThe simplest vacuum tube, the [[diode]] invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], contains only a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. Electrons can only flow in one direction through the device\u2014from the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more [[control grid]]s within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoddeson|first=L|title=The Vacuum Tube|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415063342/http://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century.

Overall though, a basic [[communication system|telecommunication system]] consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another:\n* A [[transmitter]] that takes information and converts it to a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]].\n* A [[transmission medium]], also called the ''physical channel'' that carries the signal. An example of this is the [[Free-space optical communication|\"free space channel\"]].\n* A [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back into usable information for the recipient.\n\nFor example, in a [[radio station|radio broadcasting station]] the station's large [[power amplifier]] is the transmitter; and the broadcasting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is the interface between the power amplifier and the \"free space channel\". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the [[radio receiver]] is the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.\n\nSometimes, telecommunication systems are [[duplex (telecommunications)|\"duplex\"]] (two-way systems) with a single box of [[electronics]] working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a ''transceiver''. For example, a [[cellular telephone]] is a transceiver.<ref name=\"stallings-intro\">{{cite book | last = Haykin | first = Simon | edition= 4th | title = Communication Systems | url = https://archive.org/details/communicationsy000simo | url-access = registration | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2001 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/communicationsy000simo/page/n21 1]\u20133 | isbn = 978-0-471-17869-9 }}</ref> The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in [[watt]]s or [[kilowatt]]s, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the [[microwatt]]s or [[nanowatt]]s. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.\n\nTelecommunication over fixed lines is called [[point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point communication]] because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called [[broadcasting|broadcast communication]] because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.<ref name=\"stallings-intro\" />\n\nTelecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called [[multiplexing|multiplex systems]]. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.\n\n=== Analog versus digital communications ===\nCommunications signals can be sent either by [[analog signal]]s or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signals]]. There are [[analog communication]] systems and [[digital communication]] systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by [[noise (signal processing)|undesirable physical noise]]. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely [[random process|random way]]. This form of noise is called [[additive noise]], with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.\n\nOn the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ambardar | first = Ashok | edition = 2nd | title = Analog and Digital Signal Processing | publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/analogdigitalsig00amba/page/1 1\u20132] | isbn = 978-0-534-95409-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/analogdigitalsig00amba/page/1 }}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunication networks ===\nA [[telecommunications network]] is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and [[communications channel]]s that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more [[Router (computing)|routers]] that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more [[telephone switch|switches]] that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, [[repeater]]s may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat [[attenuation]] that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.<ref name=\"glossary\">[http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ ATIS Telecom Glossary 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302071329/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |date=2 March 2008 }}, ATIS Committee T1A1 Performance and Signal Processing (approved by the American National Standards Institute), 28 February 2001.</ref>\nAnother advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are easier to store than a continuous range of states.\n\n=== Communication channels ===\nThe term \"channel\" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the [[atmosphere]] for sound communications, glass [[optical fiber]]s for some kinds of [[optical communications]], [[coaxial cable]]s for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and [[Free-space optical communication|free space]] for communications using [[visible light]], [[infrared|infrared waves]], [[ultraviolet light]], and [[radio wave]]s. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or \"radio guide\", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.conwire.com/coax-cable-rg-cable-blog|title=Coax Cable FAQ Series: What is RG Cable? \u2013 Conwire|date=12 January 2016|work=Conwire|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> This last channel is called the \"free space channel\". The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect [[vacuum]] just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.\n\nThe other meaning of the term \"channel\" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase [[channel (communications)|communications channel]], which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5&nbsp;[[MHz]] (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1&nbsp;MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of about 180&nbsp;[[kHz]] (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [[Carrier wave|\"carrier frequencies\"]]. Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200&nbsp;kHz, and the difference between 200&nbsp;kHz and 180&nbsp;kHz (20&nbsp;kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.\n\nIn the example above, the \"free space channel\" has been divided into communications channels according to [[frequency|frequencies]], and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called \"[[frequency-division multiplexing]]\".  Another term for the same concept is \"[[wavelength-division multiplexing]]\", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.\n\nAnother way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a \"time slot\", for example, 20 [[milliseconds]] out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called \"[[time-division multiplexing]]\" ('''TDM'''), and is used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and FDM.\n\n=== Modulation ===\nThe shaping of a signal to convey information is known as [[modulation]]. Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called [[keying (telecommunications)|\"keying\"]]\u2014a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications\u2014and several keying techniques exist (these include [[phase-shift keying]], [[frequency-shift keying]], and [[amplitude-shift keying]]). The \"[[Bluetooth]]\" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices.<ref>Haykin, pp. 344\u2013403.</ref><ref>[http://www.bluetooth.org/foundry/adopters/document/Core_v2.0_EDR/en/1/Core_v2.0_EDR.zip Bluetooth Specification Version 2.0 + EDR] (p. 27), Bluetooth, 2004.</ref> In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) \"[[quadrature amplitude modulation]]\" (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.\n\nModulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the \"[[carrier wave]]\") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most basic being [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and [[frequency modulation]] (FM)]. An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96&nbsp;MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel \"96&nbsp;FM\").<ref>Haykin, pp. 88\u2013126.</ref> In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).\n\n== Society ==\nTelecommunication has a significant social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the [[telecommunication industry]]'s revenue at $4.7&nbsp;trillion or just under 3 percent of the [[gross world product]] (official exchange rate).<ref name=\"plunkettresearch01\" /> Several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society.\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\n==== Microeconomics ====\nOn the microeconomic scale, companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer [[Walmart]] has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lenert | first = Edward |date=December 1998 | title = A Communication Theory Perspective on Telecommunications Policy | journal = Journal of Communication| volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 3\u201323 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02767.x}}</ref> In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In [[Bangladesh]]'s Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mireille Samaan | title = The Effect of Income Inequality on Mobile Phone Penetration | version = Boston University Honors thesis | date = April 2003 | url = http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ashonors | format = PDF | accessdate =8 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214102055/http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ashonors |archivedate = 14 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Macroeconomics ====\nOn the macroeconomic scale, Lars-Hendrik R\u00f6ller and [[Leonard Waverman]] suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.91.4.909 | last = R\u00f6ller | first = Lars-Hendrik |author2=Leonard Waverman  | title = Telecommunications Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Simultaneous Approach | journal = American Economic Review | issn = 0002-8282 | year = 2001 | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 909\u201323| citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.9393 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Christine Zhen-Wei Qiang and Carlo M.

A 2003 survey by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Access Index (DAI)|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/dai/|publisher=itu.int|accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref> Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and [[Iceland]] received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/wtdr_03/index.html World Telecommunication Development Report 2003], International Telecommunication Union, 2003.</ref>\n\n=== Social impact ===\nTelecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.<ref name=\"fischer\">Fischer, Claude S. {{\"'}}Touch Someone': The Telephone Industry Discovers Sociability.\" Technology and Culture 29.1 (January 1988): 32\u201361. {{doi|10.2307/3105226}}. {{JSTOR|3105226}}.</ref>\n\nSince then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of [[social networking site]]s has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to [[courtship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How do you know your love is real?

In 2000, market research group [[Ipsos MORI]] reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom had used the service to coordinate social arrangements and 42% to flirt.<ref>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/1575/I-Just-Text-To-Say-I-Love-You.aspx I Just Text To Say I Love You], Ipsos MORI, September 2005.</ref>\n\n=== Other impacts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left: 5px;\"\n|+News source preference of Americans in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Online News: For many home broadband users, the internet is a primary news source|publisher=Pew Internet Project|url=http://www.ccgrouppr.com/PIP_News.and.Broadband.pdf|date=22 March 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021122359/http://www.ccgrouppr.com/PIP_News.and.Broadband.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n| Local TV || 59%\n|-\n| National TV || 47%\n|-\n| Radio || 44%\n|-\n| Local paper || 38%\n|-\n| Internet || 23%\n|-\n| National paper || 12%\n|-\n| colspan = 2|<small>Survey permitted multiple answers</small>\n|}\nIn cultural terms, telecommunication has increased the public's ability to access music and film.

The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller [[pulse dialing|dials]] the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small [[microphone]] in the caller's [[handset]]. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small [[loudspeaker|speaker]] in that person's handset.\n\nAs of 2015, the landline telephones in most residential homes are analog\u2014that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage.<ref>Michael Hacker, David Burghardt, Linnea Fletcher, Anthony Gordon, William Peruzzi, Richard Prestopnik, Michael Qa\u00edssaunee, ''Engineering and Technology'', p. 433, Cengage Learning, 2015 {{ISBN|1-305-85577-9}}.</ref> Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).\n\nMobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6&nbsp;million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m).<ref>[http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_145891_11.html Gartner Says Top Six Vendors Drive Worldwide Mobile Phone Sales to 21% Growth in 2005], Gartner Group, 28 February 2006.</ref> In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth.<ref>[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 Africa Calling] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624100209/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 |date=24 June 2006 }}, Victor and Irene Mbarika, [[IEEE Spectrum]], May 2006.</ref> Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as [[GSM]] or [[W-CDMA]] with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]].<ref>[http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 Ten Years of GSM in Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110058/http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 |date=20 July 2008 }}, Australia Telecommunications Association, 2003.</ref>\n\nThere have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of [[TAT-8]] in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optical fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optical fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8.<ref>[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html Milestones in AT&T History], AT&T Knowledge Ventures, 2006.</ref> This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optical fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable.<ref>[http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html Optical fibre waveguide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524033058/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html |date=24 May 2006 }}, Saleem Bhatti, 1995.</ref> Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/mels/cm1500/dwdm/dwdm_ovr.pdf Fundamentals of DWDM Technology], CISCO Systems, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=31358 Report: DWDM No Match for Sonet], Mary Jander, Light Reading, 2006.</ref>\n\nAssisting communication across many modern optical fibre networks is a protocol known as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the side-by-side [[data transmission]] mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a [[traffic contract]] with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th intl | title = Data and Computer Communications | url = https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1 | url-access = registration | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1/page/337 337\u201366] | isbn = 978-0-13-183311-1 }}</ref> There are competitors to ATM, such as [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html MPLS is the future, but ATM hangs on] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706034545/http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html |date=6 July 2007 }}, John Dix, Network World, 2002</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lazar|first=Irwin|title=The WAN Road Ahead: Ethernet or Bust?|url=http://www.telarus.com/industry/the-wan-road-ahead:-ethernet-or-bust.html|accessdate=22 February 2011|newspaper=Telecom Industry Updates|date=22 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Radio and television ===\n{{Main|Radio|Television|Broadcasting}}\n[[File:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Digital television]] standards and their adoption worldwide]]\n\nIn a broadcast system, the central high-powered [[radio masts and towers|broadcast tower]] transmits a high-frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then [[antenna tuner|tuned]] so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a [[demodulator]] is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).<ref name=\"stallings-intro\" /><ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/radio.htm How Radio Works], HowStuffWorks.com, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[broadcast media industry]] is at a critical turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable [[integrated circuit]]s. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as [[noise (video)|snowy pictures]], [[television interference (ghosting)|ghosting]] and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011\u2014 a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using [[forward error correction]] a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.<ref>[http://www.digitaltv.com.au/ Digital Television in Australia], Digital Television News Australia, 2001.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th intl | title = Data and Computer Communications | url = https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1 | url-access = registration | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-13-183311-1 }}</ref>\n\nIn digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ISDB]] standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use [[MPEG-2]] for video compression. ATSC uses [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital AC-3]] for audio compression, ISDB uses [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses [[MPEG-1|MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2]].<ref>[http://www.dynamix.ca/doc/HDVhandbook1.pdf HDV Technology Handbook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623142640/http://www.dynamix.ca/doc/HDVhandbook1.pdf |date=23 June 2006 }}, [[Sony]], 2004.</ref><ref>[http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards_specifications/audio/ Audio], Digital Video Broadcasting Project, 2003.</ref> The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes.<!--Both DVB and ISDB use [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) for terrestrial broadcasts (as opposed to satellite or cable broadcasts) whereas ATSC uses [[8VSB|vestigial sideband modulation]] (VSB). OFDM should offer better resistance to multipath interference and the [[Doppler effect]] (which would impact reception using moving receivers).<ref>[http://www.mrcbroadcast.com/tech_services/COFDM%20vs%20VSB.html COFDM versus VSB in ENG/HD-ENG], Microwave Radio Communications, 2006.</ref> However controversial tests conducted by the United States' [[National Association of Broadcasters]] have shown that there is little difference between the two for stationary receivers.<ref>[http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/archives/mstvtestsum.html 8VSB/COFDM Comparison Report], VSB/COFDM Project, December 2000 (preface by Dale Cripps of HDTV Magazine).</ref>--> In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] standard (also known as the [[Eureka 147]] standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt [[HD Radio]]. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as [[in-band on-channel]] transmission that allows digital information to \"piggyback\" on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.<ref>[http://www.worlddab.org/cstatus.aspx Status of DAB (US)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721060832/http://www.worlddab.org/cstatus.aspx |date=21 July 2006 }}, World DAB Forum, March 2005.</ref> <!-- This avoids the bandwidth allocation issues of Eureka 147 and therefore being strongly advocated National Association of Broadcasters who felt there was a lack of new spectrum to allocate for the Eureka 147 standard. --><!-- In the United States the [[Federal Communications Commission]] has chosen to leave licensing of the standard in the hands of a commercial corporation called [[iBiquity]].<ref>[http://www.ibiquity.com/licensing/index.htm Licensing], iBiquity Digital, 2005.</ref> An open in-band on-channel standard exists in the form of [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) however adoption of this standard is mostly limited to a handful of [[shortwave|shortwave broadcasts]].

HD Radio uses a codec called [[High-Definition Coding]].-->\n\nHowever, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009<ref>{{cite news | author=Brian Stelter | title=Changeover to Digital TV Off to a Smooth Start | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/business/media/14digital.html?_r=2&hp |work=New York Times | date=13 June 2009 }}</ref> after twice delaying the switchover deadline. Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there were three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [[:File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png|here]]). These are known as [[PAL]] (German designed), [[NTSC]] (American designed), and [[SECAM]] (French designed). For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the higher cost of digital receivers.<ref>[http://www.worlddab.org/dabprod.aspx DAB Products] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621082027/http://www.worlddab.org/dabprod.aspx |date=21 June 2006 }}, World DAB Forum, 2006.</ref> The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude ('''AM''') or frequency modulation ('''FM'''). To achieve [[stereophonic sound|stereo playback]], an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for [[stereo FM]], and quadrature amplitude modulation is used for stereo AM or [[C-QUAM]].\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:OSI Model v1.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|The [[OSI reference model]]]]\n\nThe [[Internet]] is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP).<ref>Robert E. Kahn and Vinton G. Cerf, [http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/what_is_internet.html What Is The Internet (And What Makes It Work)], December 1999. (specifically see footnote xv)</ref> Any computer on the Internet has a unique [[IP address]] that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet-infrastructure.htm |title=How Internet Infrastructure Works |website=Computer.HowStuffWorks.com |year=2007 |author=Jeff Tyson}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the [[landline telephone]]). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through [[mobile phones]]).<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\"/> {{As of|2008}}, an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%).<ref>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm World Internet Users and Population Stats], internetworldstats.com, 19 March 2007.</ref> In terms of [[Broadband Internet access|broadband access]], Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/39/0,2340,en_2649_34225_36459431_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Broadband Statistics], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], December 2005.</ref>\n\nThe Internet works in part because of [[communications protocol|protocols]] that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an [[Internet browser]] to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.<ref>[http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_HistoryoftheOSIReferenceModel.htm History of the OSI Reference Model], The TCP/IP Guide v3.0, Charles M. Kozierok, 2005.</ref>\n\nFor the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.\n\nAt the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol (IP) being adopted for [[logical address]]ing. For the World Wide Web, these \"IP addresses\" are derived from the human readable form using the [[Domain Name System]] (e.g. 72.14.207.99 is derived from www.google.com). At the moment, the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/ipv6/introipv6.mspx Introduction to IPv6], Microsoft Corporation, February 2006.</ref> <!-- The main advantage of the new version is that it supports 3.40{{e|38}} addresses compared to 4.29{{e|9}} addresses. The new version also adds support for enhanced security through [[IPSec]] as well as support for [[quality of service|QoS identifiers]].-->\n\nAt the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). TCP is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers<!-- (this ordering also allows duplicate packets to be eliminated) -->. With UDP, packets are not ordered nor retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry [[TCP and UDP port|port numbers]] with them to specify what application or [[process (computing)|process]] the packet should be handled by.<ref>Stallings, pp. 683\u2013702.</ref> Because certain application-level protocols use [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|certain ports]], network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning [[WAN optimization|priority]].\n\nAbove the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) and [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.<!-- and one or the other is in use when a padlock appears in the address bar of your web browser. Security is generally based upon the principle that eavesdroppers cannot factorize very large numbers that are the composite of two primes without knowing one of the primes.--><ref>T. Dierks and C. Allen, The TLS Protocol Version 1.0, RFC 2246, 1999.</ref><!--Another protocol that loosely fits in the session and presentation layers is the [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) most notably used to stream QuickTime.<ref>[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/rtp/ RTP: About RTP and the Audio-Video Transport Working], Henning Schulzrinne, July 2006.</ref> --> Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as [[HTTP]] (web browsing), [[POP3]] (e-mail), [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] (file transfer), [[IRC]] (Internet chat), [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] (file sharing) and [[XMPP]] (instant messaging).\n\n[[VoIP|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for [[synchronous]] voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk/infosheets/voip_voice_over_internet_protocol_and_internet_telephony.htm|title= VoIP, Voice over Internet Protocol and Internet telephone calls|last= Multimedia|first= Crucible|date= 7 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Local area networks and wide area networks ===\nDespite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of [[local area network]]s (LANs)\u2014computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers\u2014remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.\n\n[[Wide area network]]s (WANs) are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers. Once again, some of their advantages include privacy and security. Prime users of private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the [[OSI reference model]]. These included [[Appletalk]], [[IPX]], and [[NetBIOS]] with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with [[MS-DOS]] users. [[TCP/IP]] existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.<ref>Martin, Michael (2000). ''Understanding the Network'' ([http://www.informit.com/content/images/0735709777/samplechapter/0735709777.pdf The Networker's Guide to AppleTalk, IPX, and NetBIOS]), SAMS Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7357-0977-7}}.</ref>\n\nAs the Internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as [[DHCP]], allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.<ref>Ralph Droms, [http://www.dhcp.org/ Resources for DHCP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704061131/http://www.dhcp.org/ |date=4 July 2007 }}, November 2003.</ref>\n\nWhereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as [[quality of service]] guarantees, and offer [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision prevention]]. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.<ref>Stallings, pp. 500\u201326.</ref>\n\nDespite the modest popularity of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use [[twisted pair|copper twisted-pair cables]] (including the common [[10BASE-T]] networks).

In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the [[anode]] by the [[electric field]] in the tube.\n\nThe simplest vacuum tube, the [[diode]] invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], contains only a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. Electrons can only flow in one direction through the device\u2014from the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more [[control grid]]s within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoddeson|first=L|title=The Vacuum Tube|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415063342/http://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century.

Thermionic tubes still have some applications for certain high-frequency amplifiers.\n\n=== Semiconductor era ===\nThe modern period of telecommunication history from 1950 onwards is referred to as the [[semiconductor]] era, due to the wide adoption of [[semiconductor devices]] in telecommunication technology.

Overall though, a basic [[communication system|telecommunication system]] consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another:\n* A [[transmitter]] that takes information and converts it to a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]].\n* A [[transmission medium]], also called the ''physical channel'' that carries the signal. An example of this is the [[Free-space optical communication|\"free space channel\"]].\n* A [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back into usable information for the recipient.\n\nFor example, in a [[radio station|radio broadcasting station]] the station's large [[power amplifier]] is the transmitter; and the broadcasting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is the interface between the power amplifier and the \"free space channel\". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the [[radio receiver]] is the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.\n\nSometimes, telecommunication systems are [[duplex (telecommunications)|\"duplex\"]] (two-way systems) with a single box of [[electronics]] working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a ''transceiver''. For example, a [[cellular telephone]] is a transceiver.<ref name=\"stallings-intro\">{{cite book | last = Haykin | first = Simon | edition= 4th | title = Communication Systems | url = https://archive.org/details/communicationsy000simo | url-access = registration | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2001 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/communicationsy000simo/page/n21 1]\u20133 | isbn = 978-0-471-17869-9 }}</ref> The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in [[watt]]s or [[kilowatt]]s, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the [[microwatt]]s or [[nanowatt]]s. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.\n\nTelecommunication over fixed lines is called [[point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point communication]] because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called [[broadcasting|broadcast communication]] because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.<ref name=\"stallings-intro\" />\n\nTelecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called [[multiplexing|multiplex systems]]. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.\n\n=== Analog versus digital communications ===\nCommunications signals can be sent either by [[analog signal]]s or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signals]]. There are [[analog communication]] systems and [[digital communication]] systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by [[noise (signal processing)|undesirable physical noise]]. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely [[random process|random way]]. This form of noise is called [[additive noise]], with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.\n\nOn the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ambardar | first = Ashok | edition = 2nd | title = Analog and Digital Signal Processing | publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/analogdigitalsig00amba/page/1 1\u20132] | isbn = 978-0-534-95409-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/analogdigitalsig00amba/page/1 }}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunication networks ===\nA [[telecommunications network]] is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and [[communications channel]]s that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more [[Router (computing)|routers]] that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more [[telephone switch|switches]] that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, [[repeater]]s may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat [[attenuation]] that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.<ref name=\"glossary\">[http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ ATIS Telecom Glossary 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302071329/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |date=2 March 2008 }}, ATIS Committee T1A1 Performance and Signal Processing (approved by the American National Standards Institute), 28 February 2001.</ref>\nAnother advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are easier to store than a continuous range of states.\n\n=== Communication channels ===\nThe term \"channel\" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the [[atmosphere]] for sound communications, glass [[optical fiber]]s for some kinds of [[optical communications]], [[coaxial cable]]s for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and [[Free-space optical communication|free space]] for communications using [[visible light]], [[infrared|infrared waves]], [[ultraviolet light]], and [[radio wave]]s. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or \"radio guide\", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.conwire.com/coax-cable-rg-cable-blog|title=Coax Cable FAQ Series: What is RG Cable? \u2013 Conwire|date=12 January 2016|work=Conwire|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> This last channel is called the \"free space channel\". The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect [[vacuum]] just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.\n\nThe other meaning of the term \"channel\" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase [[channel (communications)|communications channel]], which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5&nbsp;[[MHz]] (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1&nbsp;MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of about 180&nbsp;[[kHz]] (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [[Carrier wave|\"carrier frequencies\"]]. Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200&nbsp;kHz, and the difference between 200&nbsp;kHz and 180&nbsp;kHz (20&nbsp;kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.\n\nIn the example above, the \"free space channel\" has been divided into communications channels according to [[frequency|frequencies]], and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called \"[[frequency-division multiplexing]]\".  Another term for the same concept is \"[[wavelength-division multiplexing]]\", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.\n\nAnother way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a \"time slot\", for example, 20 [[milliseconds]] out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called \"[[time-division multiplexing]]\" ('''TDM'''), and is used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and FDM.\n\n=== Modulation ===\nThe shaping of a signal to convey information is known as [[modulation]]. Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called [[keying (telecommunications)|\"keying\"]]\u2014a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications\u2014and several keying techniques exist (these include [[phase-shift keying]], [[frequency-shift keying]], and [[amplitude-shift keying]]). The \"[[Bluetooth]]\" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices.<ref>Haykin, pp. 344\u2013403.</ref><ref>[http://www.bluetooth.org/foundry/adopters/document/Core_v2.0_EDR/en/1/Core_v2.0_EDR.zip Bluetooth Specification Version 2.0 + EDR] (p. 27), Bluetooth, 2004.</ref> In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) \"[[quadrature amplitude modulation]]\" (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.\n\nModulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the \"[[carrier wave]]\") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most basic being [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and [[frequency modulation]] (FM)]. An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96&nbsp;MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel \"96&nbsp;FM\").<ref>Haykin, pp. 88\u2013126.</ref> In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).\n\n== Society ==\nTelecommunication has a significant social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the [[telecommunication industry]]'s revenue at $4.7&nbsp;trillion or just under 3 percent of the [[gross world product]] (official exchange rate).<ref name=\"plunkettresearch01\" /> Several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society.\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\n==== Microeconomics ====\nOn the microeconomic scale, companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer [[Walmart]] has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lenert | first = Edward |date=December 1998 | title = A Communication Theory Perspective on Telecommunications Policy | journal = Journal of Communication| volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 3\u201323 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02767.x}}</ref> In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In [[Bangladesh]]'s Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mireille Samaan | title = The Effect of Income Inequality on Mobile Phone Penetration | version = Boston University Honors thesis | date = April 2003 | url = http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ashonors | format = PDF | accessdate =8 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214102055/http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ashonors |archivedate = 14 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Macroeconomics ====\nOn the macroeconomic scale, Lars-Hendrik R\u00f6ller and [[Leonard Waverman]] suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.91.4.909 | last = R\u00f6ller | first = Lars-Hendrik |author2=Leonard Waverman  | title = Telecommunications Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Simultaneous Approach | journal = American Economic Review | issn = 0002-8282 | year = 2001 | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 909\u201323| citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.9393 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Christine Zhen-Wei Qiang and Carlo M.

A 2003 survey by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Access Index (DAI)|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/dai/|publisher=itu.int|accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref> Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and [[Iceland]] received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/wtdr_03/index.html World Telecommunication Development Report 2003], International Telecommunication Union, 2003.</ref>\n\n=== Social impact ===\nTelecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.<ref name=\"fischer\">Fischer, Claude S. {{\"'}}Touch Someone': The Telephone Industry Discovers Sociability.\" Technology and Culture 29.1 (January 1988): 32\u201361. {{doi|10.2307/3105226}}. {{JSTOR|3105226}}.</ref>\n\nSince then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of [[social networking site]]s has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to [[courtship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How do you know your love is real?

The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller [[pulse dialing|dials]] the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small [[microphone]] in the caller's [[handset]]. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small [[loudspeaker|speaker]] in that person's handset.\n\nAs of 2015, the landline telephones in most residential homes are analog\u2014that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage.<ref>Michael Hacker, David Burghardt, Linnea Fletcher, Anthony Gordon, William Peruzzi, Richard Prestopnik, Michael Qa\u00edssaunee, ''Engineering and Technology'', p. 433, Cengage Learning, 2015 {{ISBN|1-305-85577-9}}.</ref> Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).\n\nMobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6&nbsp;million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m).<ref>[http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_145891_11.html Gartner Says Top Six Vendors Drive Worldwide Mobile Phone Sales to 21% Growth in 2005], Gartner Group, 28 February 2006.</ref> In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth.<ref>[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 Africa Calling] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624100209/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 |date=24 June 2006 }}, Victor and Irene Mbarika, [[IEEE Spectrum]], May 2006.</ref> Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as [[GSM]] or [[W-CDMA]] with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]].<ref>[http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 Ten Years of GSM in Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110058/http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 |date=20 July 2008 }}, Australia Telecommunications Association, 2003.</ref>\n\nThere have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of [[TAT-8]] in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optical fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optical fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8.<ref>[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html Milestones in AT&T History], AT&T Knowledge Ventures, 2006.</ref> This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optical fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable.<ref>[http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html Optical fibre waveguide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524033058/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html |date=24 May 2006 }}, Saleem Bhatti, 1995.</ref> Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/mels/cm1500/dwdm/dwdm_ovr.pdf Fundamentals of DWDM Technology], CISCO Systems, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=31358 Report: DWDM No Match for Sonet], Mary Jander, Light Reading, 2006.</ref>\n\nAssisting communication across many modern optical fibre networks is a protocol known as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the side-by-side [[data transmission]] mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a [[traffic contract]] with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th intl | title = Data and Computer Communications | url = https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1 | url-access = registration | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1/page/337 337\u201366] | isbn = 978-0-13-183311-1 }}</ref> There are competitors to ATM, such as [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html MPLS is the future, but ATM hangs on] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706034545/http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html |date=6 July 2007 }}, John Dix, Network World, 2002</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lazar|first=Irwin|title=The WAN Road Ahead: Ethernet or Bust?|url=http://www.telarus.com/industry/the-wan-road-ahead:-ethernet-or-bust.html|accessdate=22 February 2011|newspaper=Telecom Industry Updates|date=22 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Radio and television ===\n{{Main|Radio|Television|Broadcasting}}\n[[File:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Digital television]] standards and their adoption worldwide]]\n\nIn a broadcast system, the central high-powered [[radio masts and towers|broadcast tower]] transmits a high-frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then [[antenna tuner|tuned]] so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a [[demodulator]] is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).<ref name=\"stallings-intro\" /><ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/radio.htm How Radio Works], HowStuffWorks.com, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[broadcast media industry]] is at a critical turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable [[integrated circuit]]s. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as [[noise (video)|snowy pictures]], [[television interference (ghosting)|ghosting]] and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011\u2014 a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using [[forward error correction]] a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.<ref>[http://www.digitaltv.com.au/ Digital Television in Australia], Digital Television News Australia, 2001.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th intl | title = Data and Computer Communications | url = https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1 | url-access = registration | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-13-183311-1 }}</ref>\n\nIn digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide.

An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009<ref>{{cite news | author=Brian Stelter | title=Changeover to Digital TV Off to a Smooth Start | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/business/media/14digital.html?_r=2&hp |work=New York Times | date=13 June 2009 }}</ref> after twice delaying the switchover deadline. Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays.

The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet-infrastructure.htm |title=How Internet Infrastructure Works |website=Computer.HowStuffWorks.com |year=2007 |author=Jeff Tyson}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the [[landline telephone]]). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through [[mobile phones]]).<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\"/> {{As of|2008}}, an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%).<ref>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm World Internet Users and Population Stats], internetworldstats.com, 19 March 2007.</ref> In terms of [[Broadband Internet access|broadband access]], Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/39/0,2340,en_2649_34225_36459431_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Broadband Statistics], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], December 2005.</ref>\n\nThe Internet works in part because of [[communications protocol|protocols]] that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an [[Internet browser]] to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.<ref>[http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_HistoryoftheOSIReferenceModel.htm History of the OSI Reference Model], The TCP/IP Guide v3.0, Charles M. Kozierok, 2005.</ref>\n\nFor the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.\n\nAt the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol (IP) being adopted for [[logical address]]ing. For the World Wide Web, these \"IP addresses\" are derived from the human readable form using the [[Domain Name System]] (e.g. 72.14.207.99 is derived from www.google.com). At the moment, the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/ipv6/introipv6.mspx Introduction to IPv6], Microsoft Corporation, February 2006.</ref> <!-- The main advantage of the new version is that it supports 3.40{{e|38}} addresses compared to 4.29{{e|9}} addresses. The new version also adds support for enhanced security through [[IPSec]] as well as support for [[quality of service|QoS identifiers]].-->\n\nAt the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). TCP is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers<!-- (this ordering also allows duplicate packets to be eliminated) -->. With UDP, packets are not ordered nor retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry [[TCP and UDP port|port numbers]] with them to specify what application or [[process (computing)|process]] the packet should be handled by.<ref>Stallings, pp. 683\u2013702.</ref> Because certain application-level protocols use [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|certain ports]], network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning [[WAN optimization|priority]].\n\nAbove the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) and [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.<!-- and one or the other is in use when a padlock appears in the address bar of your web browser. Security is generally based upon the principle that eavesdroppers cannot factorize very large numbers that are the composite of two primes without knowing one of the primes.--><ref>T. Dierks and C. Allen, The TLS Protocol Version 1.0, RFC 2246, 1999.</ref><!--Another protocol that loosely fits in the session and presentation layers is the [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) most notably used to stream QuickTime.<ref>[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/rtp/ RTP: About RTP and the Audio-Video Transport Working], Henning Schulzrinne, July 2006.</ref> --> Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as [[HTTP]] (web browsing), [[POP3]] (e-mail), [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] (file transfer), [[IRC]] (Internet chat), [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] (file sharing) and [[XMPP]] (instant messaging).\n\n[[VoIP|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for [[synchronous]] voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk/infosheets/voip_voice_over_internet_protocol_and_internet_telephony.htm|title= VoIP, Voice over Internet Protocol and Internet telephone calls|last= Multimedia|first= Crucible|date= 7 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Local area networks and wide area networks ===\nDespite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of [[local area network]]s (LANs)\u2014computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers\u2014remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.\n\n[[Wide area network]]s (WANs) are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers. Once again, some of their advantages include privacy and security. Prime users of private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the [[OSI reference model]]. These included [[Appletalk]], [[IPX]], and [[NetBIOS]] with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with [[MS-DOS]] users. [[TCP/IP]] existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.<ref>Martin, Michael (2000). ''Understanding the Network'' ([http://www.informit.com/content/images/0735709777/samplechapter/0735709777.pdf The Networker's Guide to AppleTalk, IPX, and NetBIOS]), SAMS Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7357-0977-7}}.</ref>\n\nAs the Internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as [[DHCP]], allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.<ref>Ralph Droms, [http://www.dhcp.org/ Resources for DHCP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704061131/http://www.dhcp.org/ |date=4 July 2007 }}, November 2003.</ref>\n\nWhereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as [[quality of service]] guarantees, and offer [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision prevention]]. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.<ref>Stallings, pp. 500\u201326.</ref>\n\nDespite the modest popularity of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use [[twisted pair|copper twisted-pair cables]] (including the common [[10BASE-T]] networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers.<ref>Stallings, pp. 514\u201316.</ref> When optic fibers are used, the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. [[Multi-mode optical fiber|Multimode fibers]] can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation\u2014implying poorer long-distance performance.<ref>[http://www.arcelect.com/fibercable.htm Fiber Optic Cable Tutorial], Arc Electronics.

The 3' end of the S segment is conserved between the genera suggesting a functional role.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Virions===\nHantavirus virions are about 120\u2013160 [[nanometer]]s (nm) in diameter. The lipid bilayer of the [[viral envelope]] is about 5 nm thick and is embedded with viral surface proteins to which sugar residues are attached. These glycoproteins, known as Gn and Gc, are encoded by the M segment of the viral genome. They tend to associate ([[Dimer (chemistry)|heterodimerize]]) with each other and have both an interior tail and an exterior domain that extends to about 6 nm beyond the envelope surface.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nInside the envelope are the nucleocapsids. These are composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid protein N, which interact with the three segments of the viral genome to form helical structures. The virally encoded [[RNA polymerase]] is also found in the interior. By mass, the virion is greater than 50% protein, 20\u201330% lipid and 2\u20137% carbohydrate. The density of the virions is 1.18&nbsp;gram per cubic centimeter. These features are common to all members of the ''Hantaviridae'' family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Life cycle===\nEntry into host cells is thought to occur by attachment of virions to cellular receptors and subsequent [[endocytosis]]. Nucleocapsids are introduced into the cytoplasm by pH-dependent fusion of the virion with the [[endosomal membrane]]. After the release of the nucleocapsids into cytoplasm, the complexes are targeted to the ER\u2013Golgi Intermediate compartments (ERGIC) through [[microtubule|microtubular]]-associated movement resulting in the formation of viral factories at ERGIC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese factories then facilitate transcription and subsequent translation of the viral proteins. Transcription of viral genes must be initiated by association of the L protein with the three nucleocapsid species. In addition to transcriptase and replicase functions, the viral L protein is also thought to have an endonuclease activity that cleaves cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the production of capped primers used to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. As a result of this [[cap snatching]], the mRNAs of hantaviruses are capped and contain nontemplated 5'-terminal extensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garcin|first=D.|last2=Lezzi|first2=M.|last3=Dobbs|first3=M.|last4=Elliott|first4=R.

The L protein produces nascent genomes by replication via a positive-sense RNA intermediate. Hantavirus virions are believed to assemble by association of nucleocapsids with glycoproteins embedded in the membranes of the Golgi, followed by budding into the [[Golgi cisternae]]. Nascent virions are then transported in secretory [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] to the [[plasma membrane]] and released by [[exocytosis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Pathogenesis ===\nThe pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is unclear as there is a lack of animal models to describe it (rats and mice do not seem to acquire severe disease). While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS the main effect is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually appear around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.<ref name=CLA>{{cite web |title=Hantavirus: Canadian Lung Association  |publisher=Canadian Lung Association  |date=26 November 2015  |url=https://www.lung.ca/lung-health/lung-disease/hantavirus  |accessdate=23 April 2018  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302114405/http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/a-z/hantavirus-hantavirus/index_e.php  |archivedate=2 March 2011  }}</ref>\n\n=== Transmission ===\nThe viruses that cause hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have not been shown to transfer from person to person, except for [[Andes virus]].<ref name=\"Martinez2005\" /> For other species of hantavirus, aerosolized rodent excreta or rodent bites are the only known routes of transmission to humans.

into account the inconsistencies in the theory of coevolution, it was proposed in 2009 that the patterns seen in hantaviruses in relation to their reservoirs could be attributed to preferential host switching directed by geographical proximity and adaptation to specific host types.<ref name=\"doi10.1093/molbev/msn234\"/> Another proposal from 2010 is that geographical clustering of hantavirus sequences may have been caused by an isolation-by-distance mechanism.<ref name=\"doi10.1128/Jvi.01226-09\"/> Upon comparison of the hantaviruses found in hosts of orders [[Rodent]]ia and [[Soricomorpha]], it was proposed in 2011 that the hantavirus evolutionary history is a mix of both host switching and codivergence and that ancestral shrews or moles, rather than rodents, may have

These subsequently spread to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], North America and [[Siberia]] possibly carried by their hosts.

The 3' end of the S segment is conserved between the genera suggesting a functional role.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Virions===\nHantavirus virions are about 120\u2013160 [[nanometer]]s (nm) in diameter. The lipid bilayer of the [[viral envelope]] is about 5 nm thick and is embedded with viral surface proteins to which sugar residues are attached. These glycoproteins, known as Gn and Gc, are encoded by the M segment of the viral genome. They tend to associate ([[Dimer (chemistry)|heterodimerize]]) with each other and have both an interior tail and an exterior domain that extends to about 6 nm beyond the envelope surface.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nInside the envelope are the nucleocapsids. These are composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid protein N, which interact with the three segments of the viral genome to form helical structures. The virally encoded [[RNA polymerase]] is also found in the interior. By mass, the virion is greater than 50% protein, 20\u201330% lipid and 2\u20137% carbohydrate. The density of the virions is 1.18&nbsp;gram per cubic centimeter. These features are common to all members of the ''Hantaviridae'' family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Life cycle===\nEntry into host cells is thought to occur by attachment of virions to cellular receptors and subsequent [[endocytosis]]. Nucleocapsids are introduced into the cytoplasm by pH-dependent fusion of the virion with the [[endosomal membrane]]. After the release of the nucleocapsids into cytoplasm, the complexes are targeted to the ER\u2013Golgi Intermediate compartments (ERGIC) through [[microtubule|microtubular]]-associated movement resulting in the formation of viral factories at ERGIC.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese factories then facilitate transcription and subsequent translation of the viral proteins. Transcription of viral genes must be initiated by association of the L protein with the three nucleocapsid species. In addition to transcriptase and replicase functions, the viral L protein is also thought to have an endonuclease activity that cleaves cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the production of capped primers used to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. As a result of this [[cap snatching]], the mRNAs of hantaviruses are capped and contain nontemplated 5'-terminal extensions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garcin|first=D.|last2=Lezzi|first2=M.|last3=Dobbs|first3=M.|last4=Elliott|first4=R.

The L protein produces nascent genomes by replication via a positive-sense RNA intermediate. Hantavirus virions are believed to assemble by association of nucleocapsids with glycoproteins embedded in the membranes of the Golgi, followed by budding into the [[Golgi cisternae]]. Nascent virions are then transported in secretory [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] to the [[plasma membrane]] and released by [[exocytosis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Pathogenesis ===\nThe pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is unclear as there is a lack of animal models to describe it (rats and mice do not seem to acquire severe disease). While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS the main effect is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually appear around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.<ref name=CLA>{{cite web |title=Hantavirus: Canadian Lung Association  |publisher=Canadian Lung Association  |date=26 November 2015  |url=https://www.lung.ca/lung-health/lung-disease/hantavirus  |accessdate=23 April 2018  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302114405/http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/a-z/hantavirus-hantavirus/index_e.php  |archivedate=2 March 2011  }}</ref>\n\n=== Transmission ===\nThe viruses that cause hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have not been shown to transfer from person to person, except for [[Andes virus]].<ref name=\"Martinez2005\" /> For other species of hantavirus, aerosolized rodent excreta or rodent bites are the only known routes of transmission to humans.

into account the inconsistencies in the theory of coevolution, it was proposed in 2009 that the patterns seen in hantaviruses in relation to their reservoirs could be attributed to preferential host switching directed by geographical proximity and adaptation to specific host types.<ref name=\"doi10.1093/molbev/msn234\"/> Another proposal from 2010 is that geographical clustering of hantavirus sequences may have been caused by an isolation-by-distance mechanism.<ref name=\"doi10.1128/Jvi.01226-09\"/> Upon comparison of the hantaviruses found in hosts of orders [[Rodent]]ia and [[Soricomorpha]], it was proposed in 2011 that the hantavirus evolutionary history is a mix of both host switching and codivergence and that ancestral shrews or moles, rather than rodents, may have

These subsequently spread to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], North America and [[Siberia]] possibly carried by their hosts.

Genotype ''Dobrava'' is found in the [[yellow-necked mouse]] (''Apodemus flavicollis''); genotypes ''Saaremaa'' and ''Kurkino'' in the [[striped field mouse]] (''Apodemus agrarius''), and genotype ''Sochi'' in the [[Black Sea field mouse]] (''Apodemus ponticus'').\n\nIn 2017 alone, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany received 1,713 notifications of hantavirus infections.<ref>Hofmann J, Kr\u00fcger DH, Loyen M: \"''Hantavirus-Infektionen in Deutschland&nbsp;\u2013 ein R\u00fcckblick auf das Ausbruchsjahr 2017''{{-\"}}.
