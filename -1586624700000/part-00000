{"title_page": "Satellite constellation", "text_new": "[[File:GPS satellite constellation.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] constellation calls for 24 satellites to be distributed equally among six [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital planes]]]]\nA '''satellite constellation''' is a group of [[artificial satellite]]s working together as a system. Unlike a single satellite, a constellation can provide permanent global or near-global [[pass (spaceflight)|coverage]], such that at any time everywhere on Earth at least one satellite is visible. Satellites are typically placed in sets of complementary [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital planes]] and connect to globally distributed [[ground station]]s. They may also use [[Inter-satellite service|inter-satellite communication]].\n\nSatellite constellations should not be confused with ''satellite clusters'', which are groups of satellites moving very close together in almost identical orbits (see [[satellite formation flying]]), ''satellite programs'' (such as [[Landsat program|Landsat]]), which are generations of satellites launched in succession, and ''satellite fleets'', which are groups of satellites from the same manufacturer or operator that function independently from each other (not as a system).\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Flare at Paranal.jpg|thumb|A bright artificial satellite flare is visible above the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]. Satellite constellations have an impact on ground-based astronomy.<ref>{{cite web |title=On the increasing number of satellite constellations |url=https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann19029/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=10 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth orbiting satellites]] (LEOs) are often deployed in satellite constellations, because the coverage area provided by a single LEO satellite only covers a small area that moves as the satellite travels at the high [[angular velocity]] needed to maintain its [[Planetary orbit|orbit]].  Many LEO satellites are needed to maintain continuous coverage over an area. This contrasts with [[geostationary]] satellites, where a single satellite, moving at the same angular velocity as the rotation of the Earth's surface, provides permanent coverage over a large area.\n\nExamples of satellite constellations include the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] and [[GLONASS]] constellations for [[navigation]] and [[geodesy]], the [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]] and [[Globalstar]] satellite telephony services, the [[Disaster Monitoring Constellation]] and [[RapidEye]] for remote sensing, the [[Orbcomm]] messaging service, Russian [[elliptic orbit]] [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] and Tundra constellations, the large-scale [[Teledesic]], Skybridge, and [[Celestri]] [[broadband]] constellation proposals of the 1990s, and more recent systems such as [[O3b]] or the [[OneWeb]] proposal.\n\nFor applications which benefit from low-latency [[telecommunication|communications]], LEO satellite constellations provide an advantage over a geostationary satellite, where minimum theoretical latency from ground to satellite is about 125 milliseconds, compared to 1\u20134 milliseconds for a LEO satellite.  A LEO satellite constellation can also provide more system capacity by frequency reuse across its coverage, with [[spot beam]] frequency use being analogous to the minimum number of satellites needed to provide a service, and their orbits\u2014is a field in itself.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Walker Constellation ===\n\nThere are a large number of constellations that may satisfy a particular mission. Usually constellations are designed so that the satellites have similar orbits, eccentricity and inclination so that any perturbations affect each satellite in approximately the same way. In this way, the geometry can be preserved without excessive station-keeping thereby reducing the fuel usage and hence increasing the life of the satellites. Another consideration is that the phasing of each satellite in an orbital plane maintains sufficient separation to avoid collisions or interference at orbit plane intersections. Circular orbits are popular, because then the satellite is at a constant altitude requiring a constant strength signal to communicate.\n\nA class of circular orbit geometries that has become popular is the Walker Delta Pattern constellation.\nThis has an associated notation to describe it which was proposed by John Walker.<ref>J. G. Walker, Satellite constellations, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol. 37, pp. 559-571, 1984</ref> His notation is:\n\n:::'''i: t/p/f'''\n\nwhere:\n'''i''' is the inclination;\n'''t''' is the total number of satellites;\n'''p''' is the number of equally spaced planes; and\n'''f''' is the relative spacing between satellites in adjacent planes. The change in true anomaly (in degrees) for equivalent satellites in neighbouring planes is equal to '''f'''*360/'''t'''.\n\nFor example, the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo Navigation system]] is a Walker Delta 56\u00b0:24/3/1 constellation. This means there are 24 satellites in 3 planes inclined at 56 degrees, spanning the 360 degrees around the [[equator]]. The \"1\" defines the phasing between the planes, and how they are spaced. The Walker Delta is also known as the Ballard rosette, after A. H. Ballard's similar earlier work.<ref>A. H. Ballard, Rosette Constellations of Earth Satellites, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Vol 16 No. 5, Sep. 1980.</ref><ref>J. G. Walker, Comments on \"Rosette constellations of earth satellites\", IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, vol. 18 no. 4, pp. 723-724,\nNovember 1982.</ref> Ballard's notation is (t,p,m) where m is a multiple of the fractional offset between planes.\n\nAnother popular constellation type is the near-polar Walker Star, which is used by [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]]. Here, the satellites are in near-polar circular orbits across approximately 180 degrees, travelling north on one side of the Earth, and south on the other.  The active satellites in the full Iridium constellation form a Walker Star of 86.4\u00b0:66/6/2, i.e. the phasing repeats every two planes. Walker uses similar notation for stars and deltas, which can be confusing.\n\nThese sets of circular orbits at constant altitude are sometimes referred to as [[orbital shell (spaceflight)|orbital shells]].\n\n=== Broadband ===\nIn 2015 Farooq Khan then the President of [[Samsung Research America]] published a research paper providing details how a large satellite broadband constellation can be designed.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Khan|first1=Farooq|title=Mobile Internet from the Heavens|eprint=1508.02383|date=9 August 2015|class=cs.NI}}</ref>\n\n== List of satellite constellations ==\n\n===

Unlike a single satellite, a constellation can provide permanent global or near-global [[pass (spaceflight)|coverage]], such that at any time everywhere on Earth at least one satellite is visible. Satellites are typically placed in sets of complementary [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital planes]] and connect to globally distributed [[ground station]]s. They may also use [[Inter-satellite service|inter-satellite communication]].\n\nSatellite constellations should not be confused with ''satellite clusters'', which are groups of satellites moving very close together in almost identical orbits (see [[satellite formation flying]]), ''satellite programs'' (such as [[Landsat program|Landsat]]), which are generations of satellites launched in succession, and ''satellite fleets'', which are groups of satellites from the same manufacturer or operator that function independently from each other (not as a system).\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Flare at Paranal.jpg|thumb|A bright artificial satellite flare is visible above the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]. Satellite constellations have an impact on ground-based astronomy.<ref>{{cite web |title=On the increasing number of satellite constellations |url=https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann19029/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=10 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth orbiting satellites]] (LEOs) are often deployed in satellite constellations, because the coverage area provided by a single LEO satellite only covers a small area that moves as the satellite travels at the high [[angular velocity]] needed to maintain its [[Planetary orbit|orbit]].  Many LEO satellites are needed to maintain continuous coverage over an area. This contrasts with [[geostationary]] satellites, where a single satellite, moving at the same angular velocity as the rotation of the Earth's surface, provides permanent coverage over a large area.\n\nExamples of satellite constellations include the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] and [[GLONASS]] constellations for [[navigation]] and [[geodesy]], the [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]] and [[Globalstar]] satellite telephony services, the [[Disaster Monitoring Constellation]] and [[RapidEye]] for remote sensing, the [[Orbcomm]] messaging service, Russian [[elliptic orbit]] [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] and Tundra constellations, the large-scale [[Teledesic]], Skybridge, and [[Celestri]] [[broadband]] constellation proposals of the 1990s, and more recent systems such as [[O3b]] or the [[OneWeb]] proposal.\n\nFor applications which benefit from low-latency [[telecommunication|communications]], LEO satellite constellations provide an advantage over a geostationary satellite, where minimum theoretical latency from ground to satellite is about 125 milliseconds, compared to 1\u20134 milliseconds for a LEO satellite.  A LEO satellite constellation can also provide more system capacity by frequency reuse across its coverage, with [[spot beam]] frequency use being analogous to the minimum number of satellites needed to provide a service, and their orbits\u2014is a field in itself.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Walker Constellation ===\n\nThere are a large number of constellations that may satisfy a particular mission. Usually constellations are designed so that the satellites have similar orbits, eccentricity and inclination so that any perturbations affect each satellite in approximately the same way. In this way, the geometry can be preserved without excessive station-keeping thereby reducing the fuel usage and hence increasing the life of the satellites. Another consideration is that the phasing of each satellite in an orbital plane maintains sufficient separation to avoid collisions or interference at orbit plane intersections. Circular orbits are popular, because then the satellite is at a constant altitude requiring a constant strength signal to communicate.\n\nA class of circular orbit geometries that has become popular is the Walker Delta Pattern constellation.\nThis has an associated notation to describe it which was proposed by John Walker.<ref>J. G. Walker, Satellite constellations, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol. 37, pp. 559-571, 1984</ref> His notation is:\n\n:::'''i: t/p/f'''\n\nwhere:\n'''i''' is the inclination;\n'''t''' is the total number of satellites;\n'''p''' is the number of equally spaced planes; and\n'''f''' is the relative spacing between satellites in adjacent planes. The change in true anomaly (in degrees) for equivalent satellites in neighbouring planes is equal to '''f'''*360/'''t'''.\n\nFor example, the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo Navigation system]] is a Walker Delta 56\u00b0:24/3/1 constellation. This means there are 24 satellites in 3 planes inclined at 56 degrees, spanning the 360 degrees around the [[equator]]. The \"1\" defines the phasing between the planes, and how they are spaced. The Walker Delta is also known as the Ballard rosette, after A. H. Ballard's similar earlier work.<ref>A. H. Ballard, Rosette Constellations of Earth Satellites, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Vol 16 No. 5, Sep. 1980.</ref><ref>J. G. Walker, Comments on \"Rosette constellations of earth satellites\", IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, vol. 18 no. 4, pp. 723-724,\nNovember 1982.</ref> Ballard's notation is (t,p,m) where m is a multiple of the fractional offset between planes.\n\nAnother popular constellation type is the near-polar Walker Star, which is used by [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]]. Here, the satellites are in near-polar circular orbits across approximately 180 degrees, travelling north on one side of the Earth, and south on the other.  The active satellites in the full Iridium constellation form a Walker Star of 86.4\u00b0:66/6/2, i.e. the phasing repeats every two planes. Walker uses similar notation for stars and deltas, which can be confusing.\n\nThese sets of circular orbits at constant altitude are sometimes referred to as [[orbital shell (spaceflight)|orbital shells]].\n\n=== Broadband ===\nIn 2015 Farooq Khan then the President of [[Samsung Research America]] published a research paper providing details how a large satellite broadband constellation can be

The screenplay was written by [[John Briley]] based on a pair of books by journalist [[Donald Woods]]. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist [[Steve Biko]] and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. [[Denzel Washington]] stars as Biko, while actor [[Kevin Kline]] portrays Woods. ''Cry Freedom'' delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.\n\nA joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Universal Pictures]] and Marble Arch Productions and the film was primarily shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] and in [[Kenya]] due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures opening in the United States on 6 November 1987. South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.<ref name=\"nyTimesCryFreedom\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/28/world/pretoria-censors-to-let-cry-freedom-be-seen.html|title=Pretoria Censors to Let 'Cry Freedom' Be Seen|last=Battersby|first=John D.|date=1987-11-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=|last2=|first2=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe film was generally met with favourable reviews and earned [[theatrical rental]]s of $15 million worldwide. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], South Africa, liberal journalist [[Donald Woods]] (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist [[Steve Biko]] (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially [[banning order|''banned'']] by the [[South African government]] and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at [[King William's Town]]. Woods is opposed to Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.\n\nAfter speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by the South African security forces (who have been tipped off by an informer).  Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalise the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with [[Jimmy Kruger]] ([[John Thaw]]), the South African Minister of Justice, in his house in [[Pretoria]] in an attempt to prevent further abuses. Kruger first expresses discontent over their actions; however Woods is later harassed at his home by security forces, who insinuate that their orders came directly from Kruger.\n\nLater, Biko travels to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him asking him him to say his name and he said \"Bantu Stephen Biko\". He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1&nbsp;020&nbsp;km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.\n\nWoods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], disguised as a priest. His wife [[Wendy Woods|Wendy]] ([[Penelope Wilton]]) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist [[Bruce Haigh]] ([[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]]), the [[British High Commission]] in Maseru, and the [[Government of Lesotho]], they are flown under [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|United Nations passports]] and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via [[Botswana]] to London, where they were granted [[political asylum]].\n\nThe film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Steve Biko]]\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as [[Donald Woods]]\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Wendy Woods\n* [[Alec McCowen]] as British Acting High Commissioner\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as Ken Robertson\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as State Prosecutor\n* [[John Thaw]] as [[Jimmy Kruger]]\n* [[Timothy West]] as Captain De Wet\n* [[Josette Simon]] as Dr. [[Mamphela Ramphele]]\n* [[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]] as [[Bruce Haigh]]\n* [[Miles Anderson]] as Lemick\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Father Kani\n* [[John Matshikiza]] as Mapetla\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|right|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa in the late 1970s.]]\nThe premise of ''Cry Freedom'' is based on the true story of [[Steve Biko]], the charismatic South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]] leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of [[Apartheid]], and [[Donald Woods]], the [[Liberalism in South Africa|liberal]] white editor of the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered.

These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973.<ref name=\"SouthAfricanHistory\" /> The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody.

The screenplay was written by [[John Briley]] based on a pair of books by journalist [[Donald Woods]]. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist [[Steve Biko]] and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. [[Denzel Washington]] stars as Biko, while actor [[Kevin Kline]] portrays Woods. ''Cry Freedom'' delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.\n\nA joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Universal Pictures]] and Marble Arch Productions and the film was primarily shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] and in [[Kenya]] due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures opening in the United States on 6 November 1987. South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.<ref name=\"nyTimesCryFreedom\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/28/world/pretoria-censors-to-let-cry-freedom-be-seen.html|title=Pretoria Censors to Let 'Cry Freedom' Be Seen|last=Battersby|first=John D.|date=1987-11-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=|last2=|first2=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe film was generally met with favourable reviews and earned [[theatrical rental]]s of $15 million worldwide. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], South Africa, liberal journalist [[Donald Woods]] (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist [[Steve Biko]] (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially [[banning order|''banned'']] by the [[South African government]] and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at [[King William's Town]]. Woods is opposed to Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.\n\nAfter speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by the South African security forces (who have been tipped off by an informer).  Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalise the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with [[Jimmy Kruger]] ([[John Thaw]]), the South African Minister of Justice, in his house in [[Pretoria]] in an attempt to prevent further abuses. Kruger first expresses discontent over their actions; however Woods is later harassed at his home by security forces, who insinuate that their orders came directly from Kruger.\n\nLater, Biko travels to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him asking him him to say his name and he said \"Bantu Stephen Biko\". He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1&nbsp;020&nbsp;km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.\n\nWoods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], disguised as a priest. His wife [[Wendy Woods|Wendy]] ([[Penelope Wilton]]) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist [[Bruce Haigh]] ([[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]]), the [[British High Commission]] in Maseru, and the [[Government of Lesotho]], they are flown under [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|United Nations passports]] and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via [[Botswana]] to London, where they were granted [[political asylum]].\n\nThe film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Steve Biko]]\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as [[Donald Woods]]\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Wendy Woods\n* [[Alec McCowen]] as British Acting High Commissioner\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as Ken Robertson\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as State Prosecutor\n* [[John Thaw]] as [[Jimmy Kruger]]\n* [[Timothy West]] as Captain De Wet\n* [[Josette Simon]] as Dr. [[Mamphela Ramphele]]\n* [[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]] as [[Bruce Haigh]]\n* [[Miles Anderson]] as Lemick\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Father Kani\n* [[John Matshikiza]] as Mapetla\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|right|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa in the late 1970s.]]\nThe premise of ''Cry Freedom'' is based on the true story of [[Steve Biko]], the charismatic South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]] leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of [[Apartheid]], and [[Donald Woods]], the [[Liberalism in South Africa|liberal]] white editor of the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered.

He also edited and published compilations of his work, which greatly influenced [[visual artist]]s and the developing fields of scientific and industrial photography. He returned to his native England permanently in 1894. In 1904, [[Kingston Museum]], was opened in his hometown and continues to house a collection of his works to this day in a dedicated 'Muybridge Exhibition'. \n\n== Names ==\nEdward James Muggeridge was born and raised in England.

From 1855 to 1865, he mainly used the surname \"Muygridge\".{{sfn|Solnit|2003|p=7|ps=}}\n\nFrom 1865 onward, he used the surname \"Muybridge\". \n\nIn addition, he used the [[pseudonym]] ''[[Helios]]'' (Titan of the sun) for his early photography. He also used this as the name of his studio and gave it to his only son, as a middle name: Florado Helios Muybridge, born in 1874.<ref>\"Exhibition notes\", ''Muybridge Exhibition'', at [[Tate Britain]], January 2011.</ref>\n\nWhile travelling in 1875 on a photography expedition in the Spanish-speaking nations of Central America, the photographer advertised his works under the name \"Eduardo Santiago Muybridge\" in [[Guatemala]].{{sfn|Solnit|2003|p=148|ps=}} \n\nAfter an 1882 trip to England, he changed the spelling of his first name to \"Eadweard\", the [[Old English]] form of his name.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses.

Muybridge intervened several times and believed the affair was over when he sent Flora to stay with a relative and Larkyns found a job at a mine near [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]]. Mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, \"Here's the answer to the letter you sent my wife\", and shot him [[point-blank]].

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://books.google.com/books?id=eHcI45y0gG8C&pg=PA159&dq=King+Edward+-+eadweard+muybridge&hl=en&ei=4aQRTfnAFJGJhQfW-cS3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=King%20Edward%20-%20eadweard%20muybridge&f=false ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, \"Here's the answer to the letter you sent my wife\", and shot him [[point-blank]].

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition.

As Pearce, Manz and Sims (2009) summarize, all definitions of shared leadership consistently include a \"process of influence\" that is \"built upon more than just downward influence on subordinates or followers by an appointed or elected leader.\"  Nearly all concepts of shared leadership entail the practice of \"broadly sharing power and influence among a set of individuals rather than centralizing it in the hands of a single individual who acts in the clear role of a dominant superior.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = C | last2 = Manz | first2 =  | last3 = Sims Jr | first3 = H.

In a 2002 paper, David Sally noted that shared leadership was present even in the early days of Republican Rome. Indeed, during those ancient times, [[Rome]] \"had a successful system of co-leadership that lasted for over four centuries. This structure of co-leadership was so effective that it extended from the lower levels of the Roman magistracy to the very top position, that of [[consul]].\" (Sally, 2002) Despite such early incantations of the practice, however, most of the scholarly work on leadership has still been predominantly focused on the study of leadership in its hierarchical form. Leadership is conceived around a single individual \u2013 the leader \u2013 and how that person inspires, entices, commands, cajoles and controls followers. Research on shared leadership instead departs from the notion that leadership may well be studied as a collective phenomenon, as activities involving several individuals beyond the formally appointed manager.<ref>Crevani et al, 2010; Denis et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are some earlier conceptualizations of shared leadership. In 1924, [[Mary Parker Follet]] wrote that \"one should not only look to the designated leader, but one should let logic dictate to whom one should look for guidance\" (as cited by Crainer, 2002, p.&nbsp;72).<ref>Crainer, S. (2000). The Management Century. New York: Jossey-Bass.</ref> Along similar lines, Gibb, in 1954, wrote that, \"Leadership is probably best conceived as a group quality, as a set of functions which must be carried out by the group.\"<ref>Gibb, C. A., Gilbert, D. T., & Lindzey, G. (1954). Leadership. New York: John Wiley & Sons (p.54)</ref>  Despite these early nods toward group leadership, the formalized construct of shared leadership did not become more developed and experimentally explored until recently. Current research suggest that shared leadership forms may imply significant advantages at individual-, team-, organizational- and societal levels.<ref>Crevani et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe shift in this scholarly paradigm might partly be explained by looking at the rise of studies on [[teamwork]]. Teamwork is becoming increasingly important in the workplace literature as many organizations recognize the benefits that teamwork can bring. Thus, organizations consider it important to investigate team effectiveness and the elements that increase this. Leaders have been pointed to as critical factors in team performance and effectiveness; some have even gone as far as to say they the most important ingredient for team effectiveness.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Additionally, problems associated with team leaders are often cited as the primary reason for failures of work involving teams.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nWith the complexity and ambiguity of tasks that teams often experience, it is becoming more apparent that a single leader is unlikely to have all of the skills and traits to effectively perform the necessary leadership functions.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref> Shared leadership has been identified as the optimal model of leadership when the knowledge characteristics of interdependence, creativity, and complexity <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 =  | year = 2004 | title = The future of leadership: Combining vertical and shared leadership to transform knowledge work | url = | journal = Academy of Management Executive | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 47\u201357 }}</ref> are encountered.  Thus, shared leadership is becoming increasingly popular in teams, as multiple team members emerge as leaders, especially when they have the skills/knowledge/expertise that the team needs.\n\n== Measuring ==\nThere are two main ways that most researchers measure the existence and extent of shared leadership in a team: Ratings of the team's collective leadership behavior and Social Network Analysis. A less common technique of measuring shared leadership is with the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales.\n\n=== Ratings of team's collective leadership behavior ===\nMany studies measure shared leadership as team member perceptions of leader behavior exhibited by respective team leaders and team members.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2001</ref> Often this is done by distributing leader behavior questionnaires (surveys aimed at measuring the existence and frequency of different leader behaviors) to all members of a team. Team members are instructed to fill these out once for the appointed leader and then again for all other team members. Although this allows leadership quantity to be assessed, it does not pinpoint how many other team members are engaging in leadership behaviors or how many members are looking to the same people for leadership.\n\n=== Social network analysis ===\n[[Social network analysis]] (SNA) addresses some of the flaws of collective leader behavior ratings by assessing the patterns of connections that emerge in a team and providing a method for modeling both vertical and shared leadership within a team. SNA examines the relationships that form between individuals and uses these relationships as the units of analysis. In the leadership domain, a relationship, or \"tie\" as it is referred to in SNA literature, occurs when one team member perceives another as exerting leadership influence on the team. The proportion of actual ties that exist in a team to all potential ties that could have emerged in a team is called network density and can be used as a measure of shared leadership.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mehra | first1 = A. | last2 = Smith | first2 = B. R. | last3 = Dixon | first3 = A. L. | last4 = Robertson | first4 = B. | year = 2006 | title = Distributed leadership in teams: The network of leadership perceptions and team performance | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 232\u2013245 }}</ref>\n\nSome researchers go further into SNA and analyze a network's centralization, which helps assess the distribution of leadership, as well as the quantity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Rentsch | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = Shared Leadership in Teams: A Matter of Distribution | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 203\u2013211 | doi = 10.1027/1866-5888/a000017 }}</ref>  Network centralization is measured using [[centrality]] values that are calculated for each individual. A centrality value for an individual represents the number of connections that individual has with others. The sum of the differences between the maximum individual centrality value and every other individual centrality value, divided by the maximum possible sum of differences, produces a measure of network centralization between 0 and 1, which describes the extent to which connections are concentrated around one individual, or if multiple individuals are central to the leadership network.\n\nA shared leadership network can be further separated into distributed-coordinated or distributed-fragmented by SNA.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>  This distinction depends on whether the formal and emergent leaders in a network recognize each other as leaders and are able to coordinate and lead together efficiently.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) ===\nSome studies have sought to measure shared leadership through observations of actual leadership behaviors. [[Behaviorally anchored rating scales]] (BARS) are commonly used to assess and rate performances, and can be developed to assess different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012), for example, developed such a scale and had trained raters watch videotapes of team interactions and rate each team member's behavior in terms of the dimensions on the BARS. They then operationalized shared leadership as the number of members who performed leadership behaviors, as well as the amount of leadership behavior exhibited by the team (calculated by aggregating the leadership ratings for each team member to the team level).<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each measurement technique. Although all are attempting to measure the same phenomenon and all have been used in published studies, the particular measure that a researcher uses can impact his or her results.\n\n== Antecedents: internal and external conditions ==\nA host of scholars who have studied shared leadership found that in order for the dynamic to properly emerge, two preconditions must be met. First, team members must actually be willing to extend their feedback to the team in a way that aims to influence and motivate the direction of the group. Second, the team must overall be disposed to accept and rely on such feedback by other team members.<ref>Katz, D., & Kahn, R. L. (1978).</ref> The preconditions specified by Katz and Kahn (1978) tend to be met by leadership sharing in teams by the development of interpersonal alliances (measured by LMX-TEAM) between and among participants as several meta-analyses reported.<ref>Graen, G. B. (2013). The Oxford Handbook of Leadership, Oxford: Oxford University Press (Graen, G. B. (2013. The Social Psychology of Organizations, 2nd Ed. London: Wiley</ref> Carson et al. (2007) expanded these two requirements by describing them in a larger, two-part framework that includes the degree to which a strong internal team environment exists and the extent to which positive external team [[coaching]] occurs.<ref>Carson et al</ref>\n\n=== Internal team environment ===\nCarson et al. (2007) propose first that shared leadership is facilitated by an overall team environment that consists of three dimensions: shared purpose, social support, and voice. The three concepts are also drawn from a wide body of literature:\n\n* '''Shared [[purpose]]''' prevails when team members have similar understandings of their team's main objectives and take steps to ensure a focus on collective goals.\n* '''[[Social support]]''' is the extent to which team members actively provide emotional and psychological strength to one another. This may occur through overt acts of encouragement or expressed recognition of other team members' contributions and accomplishments.\n* '''[[Advice (opinion)|Voice]]''' is the degree to which a team's members have input into how the team carries out its purpose.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe three dimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, thereby \"representing a high order construct.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref> Carson et al. summarize the [[interconnectivity]] of these three concepts in a concise narrative: \nWhen team members are able to speak up and get involved (voice), the likelihood that many of them will exercise leadership increases greatly. The opportunity for voice also facilitates shared leadership by strengthening both a common sense of direction and the potential for positive interpersonal support in a team. When teams are focused on collective goals (shared purpose), there is a greater sense of meaning and increased motivation for team members to both speak up and invest themselves in providing leadership to the team and to respond to the leadership of others. The motivation to participate and provide input toward achieving common goals and a common purpose can also be reinforced by an encouraging and supportive climate. When team members feel recognized and supported within their team (social support) they are more willing to share responsibility, cooperate, and commit to the team's collective [[goal]]s. Thus, these three dimensions work together to create an internal team environment that is characterized by a shared understanding about purpose and goals, a sense of recognition and importance, and high levels of involvement, challenge, and cooperation.<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref>\n\n=== External team coaching ===\nScholars have also described the important role that external team leaders and support can have in the development of shared leadership.<ref>Manz, C. C., & Sims H. P. Jr. (1987). Leading worker to lead themselves: The external leadership for self-managing work team. ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 106-129.</ref>  When framing this dynamic or antecedent, scholars have stressed the importance of external [[coaching]] behaviors. One scholar defines these coaching behaviors as: \"direct interaction with a team intended to help team members make coordinated and task-appropriate use of their collective resources in accomplishing the team's task.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hackman | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Wageman | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = A theory of team coaching | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 30 | issue = | page = 269 }}</ref> Researchers have identified two types of team coaching\u2014distinguishing between those that reinforce shared leadership (supportive [[coaching]]) and those that focus on identifying team problems through task [[interventions]] (functional approach).<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Through supportive coaching, external team managers can reinforce the development of shared leadership in a variety of ways. Through active encouragement and [[positive reinforcement]] of team members who demonstrate leadership, coaching can foster independence and a sense of self-competence nurtures among team members. Coaching can also nurture collective commitment to the team and its objectives, a shared promise that can reduce free riding and increase the possibility that team members will demonstrate personal initiative.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nA second, more indirect, way that external [[coaching]] may positively encourage shared leadership is based on a functional approach. Within this approach, the role of an external team leader is to do whatever is not being adequately managed by the team itself, to \"intervene on behalf of an incomplete task.\" This functional coaching can be redundant when teams have highly supportive internal environments and therefore are less critical to the overall development of shared leadership. When interventions are necessary, however, such as when teams lack a strong shared purpose, the functional approach asserts that this kind of external influence may be particularly important. In this sense, the functional approach can be understood as providing \"motivational and consultative functions that enable shared leadership but have not been adequately developed by the team internally.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1224</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\nThough there is an ongoing debate about the existence and importance of shared leadership, many studies have shown that shared leadership is a significant predictor for various team processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Team effectiveness/performance ===\nA commonly explored consequence of shared leadership is team effectiveness or [[job performance|team performance]], which can be measured either by self-reports of team members or by outsider ratings, such as supervisor or client ratings.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2002</ref>  Performance is also sometimes measured more objectively, by using a commonly agreed-upon scale or rubric to rate the execution of a task. Many studies have found a positive relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness and performance.<ref>Sivasubramaniam, N., Murray, W. D., Avolio, B. J., & Jung, D. I. (2002). A longitudinal model of the effects of team leadership and group potency on group performance ''Group & Organization Management'' 2, 1, 66-96; Carson et al, 2007</ref> Similarly, other studies have explored the extent to which shared leadership can predict a team's effectiveness or performance, and have found that it is a significant predictor\u2014often a better predictor than vertical leadership.<ref>Pearce and Sims, 2002; Pearce et al, 2004; Ensley, Hmieleski, & Pearce, 2006</ref>\nA meta-analysis by Nicolaides and colleagues (2014) found that one reason why shared leadership relates to performance is through increasing team confidence. The researchers also found that shared leadership contributed to performance, over and above the effects of vertical leadership.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nicolaides | first1 = V.

For example, Mehra et al. (2006) first compared teams with a distributed (shared) leadership structure to teams with a more traditional (vertical) leadership structure. In contrast to other studies, they did not find that teams with shared leadership outperformed the traditional teams. However, when they separated the distributed teams into distributed-coordinated and distributed-fragmented (see measures section), they found that distributed-coordinated team structures were associated with higher performance than both traditional leader-centered teams and distributed-fragmented leadership networks. Thus, they theorized, having more leaders is not the only factor that matters to team performance; rather, leaders must recognize other leaders as such in order for them to contribute positively to team effectiveness.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Number and types of leadership ===\nNot surprisingly, shared leadership has been shown to increase the number and types of leadership (for example, [[transformational leadership]]; [[transactional leadership]]; [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|and consideration and initiating structure]]).\u00b7<ref>Bergman et al, 2012; Pearce and Sims, 2002</ref>   Shared leadership enables team members to express their different abilities, thus letting members of a team exhibit different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012) found that teams did, in fact, experience more types of leadership behaviors when multiple members of the team participated in the team's leadership. Additionally, they found that each leader only effectively engaged in one type of leadership, indicating that shared leadership lets more leadership behaviors be expressed than vertical leadership.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\n=== In schools ===\nThe effect of shared leadership at school is contingent on the key players involved and how they view their missions. Conflicting thoughts on how shared leadership influences [[student engagement]] result in a variety of interpretations by researchers. Sharing leadership also impacts how teachers interact with one another, whether they possess relationships where they reinforce one another or feel distant from the organization.\n\nOne view is that sharing leadership among more people does not necessarily bring positive student outcomes. Some researchers have called the influence of shared leadership into question, suggesting that the influence of shared leadership is statistically non-significant ([[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] & Jantzi, 1999),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Jantzi | first2 = D. | year = 1999 | title = The relative effects of principal and teacher sources of leadership on student engagement with school | url = | journal = Educational administration quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 679\u2013706 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x99355002 }}</ref> and indicating that shared leadership is \"not a significant factor for students' participation in or engagement with school\" (Silins et al., 2002).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Mulford | first2 = W.

S. | year = 2005 | title = Distributed leadership: Developing theory from practice | url = | journal = Journal of curriculum studies | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 395\u2013420 | doi = 10.1080/00220270500038545 }}</ref>\n\nConversely, it has been argued that shared leadership is positively related to students' achievement. In addition, shared leadership enables teachers to employ certain methodologies or instructional content. [[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] and Mascall(2008) conclude that shared leadership eventually influences students' math achievement indirectly by effecting teacher motivation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Mascall | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Collective leadership effects on student achievement | url = | journal = Educational Administration Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 529\u2013561 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x08321221 }}</ref> Similarly, a study by Heck and Hallinger(2009) shows that the development of school shared leadership has an indirect impact on students' academic growth in math, mutually reinforcing academic capacity of teachers and students over time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heck | first1 = R. H. | last2 = Hallinger | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = ''Assessing the contribution of distributed leadership to school improvement and growth in math achievement.

Camburn and Han's study (2009), however, does not present empirical evidence that shared leadership is associated with students' outcomes.<ref>Camburn, E. M., & Han, S. W. (2009). ''Investigating connections'' ''between distributed leadership and instructional change (pp. 25-45).'' Springer Netherlands.</ref>\n\nOther research focused on the impact of shared leadership notes the teacher perceptions. Work by Hulpia and Devos (2010) reveals that leadership practices such as the sharing of leadership roles, social interaction, cooperation of the leadership team, and inclusive decision-making, positively reinforce teachers' [[Organizational commitment|commitment to the organization.]]<ref>Hulpia, H., & Devos, G. (2010). How distributed leadership can make a difference in teachers' organizational commitment? A qualitative study. ''Teaching and'' Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies'', 26 (3),'' 565-575.</ref> It has been underscored that teachers' academic optimism, which refer to trust, teacher [[efficacy]], and [[organizational citizenship behavior]] as well, are heavily and positively associated with planned approaches to leadership distribution (Mascall et al.,2008)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mascall | first1 = B. | last2 = Leithwood | first2 = K. | last3 = Straus | first3 = T. | last4 = Sacks | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = ''The relationship between distributed leadership and teachers' academic optimism.

Shared traditional leadership refers to a task-oriented, [[Transactional leadership|transactional form of leadership]], which emphasizes maintaining the status quo. Shared new-genre leadership however focuses on [[transformational leadership]] and therefore a more inspirational, visionary, growth and change-oriented kind of leadership. Lastly, cumulative, overall leadership was assessed based on individual members\u2019 ratings of leadership influence for each of his/her peers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThe studies showed that both shared new-genre leadership and cumulative, overall shared leadership show a stronger relationship with team effectiveness than shared traditional leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Work complexity ====\nWork complexity (also known as job complexity) acts as a moderator of the shared leadership-team effectiveness relationship, namely that the relationship is stronger when work is more complex compared with when it is less complex. This can be explained by the higher interdependence, coordination and information sharing that is necessary when work complexity is high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n== Implications and further research directions ==\nScholars have pointed to 4 main areas in shared leadership that need more research: \n# Events that generate shared leadership\n# Facilitation factors\n# Most conducive influence approaches\n# Stages and life cycles in shared leadership settings (Carson et al., 2007; Pearce and Conger, 2002).\nAdditionally, more scholarship must be done on outcomes of shared leadership. The spike of recent scholarship in this field does indicate that scholars increasingly understand the significance of shared leadership as organizations in the field are also increasingly capitalizing on the many benefits a shared leadership approach can offer.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Group development]]\n* [[Group dynamics]]\n* [[Human resources]]\n* [[Leadership development]]\n* [[Leadership studies]]\n* [[Organizational development]]\n* [[Team building]]\n* [[Team composition]]\n* [[Three levels of leadership model]]\n* [[Trait leadership]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Bass, B.

As Pearce, Manz and Sims (2009) summarize, all definitions of shared leadership consistently include a \"process of influence\" that is \"built upon more than just downward influence on subordinates or followers by an appointed or elected leader.\"  Nearly all concepts of shared leadership entail the practice of \"broadly sharing power and influence among a set of individuals rather than centralizing it in the hands of a single individual who acts in the clear role of a dominant superior.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = C | last2 = Manz | first2 =  | last3 = Sims Jr | first3 = H.

In a 2002 paper, David Sally noted that shared leadership was present even in the early days of Republican Rome. Indeed, during those ancient times, [[Rome]] \"had a successful system of co-leadership that lasted for over four centuries. This structure of co-leadership was so effective that it extended from the lower levels of the Roman magistracy to the very top position, that of [[consul]].\" (Sally, 2002) Despite such early incantations of the practice, however, most of the scholarly work on leadership has still been predominantly focused on the study of leadership in its hierarchical form. Leadership is conceived around a single individual \u2013 the leader \u2013 and how that person inspires, entices, commands, cajoles and controls followers. Research on shared leadership instead departs from the notion that leadership may well be studied as a collective phenomenon, as activities involving several individuals beyond the formally appointed manager.<ref>Crevani et al, 2010; Denis et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are some earlier conceptualizations of shared leadership. In 1924, [[Mary Parker Follet]] wrote that \"one should not only look to the designated leader, but one should let logic dictate to whom one should look for guidance\" (as cited by Crainer, 2002, p.&nbsp;72).<ref>Crainer, S. (2000). The Management Century. New York: Jossey-Bass.</ref> Along similar lines, Gibb, in 1954, wrote that, \"Leadership is probably best conceived as a group quality, as a set of functions which must be carried out by the group.\"<ref>Gibb, C. A., Gilbert, D. T., & Lindzey, G. (1954). Leadership. New York: John Wiley & Sons (p.54)</ref>  Despite these early nods toward group leadership, the formalized construct of shared leadership did not become more developed and experimentally explored until recently. Current research suggest that shared leadership forms may imply significant advantages at individual-, team-, organizational- and societal levels.<ref>Crevani et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe shift in this scholarly paradigm might partly be explained by looking at the rise of studies on [[teamwork]]. Teamwork is becoming increasingly important in the workplace literature as many organizations recognize the benefits that teamwork can bring. Thus, organizations consider it important to investigate team effectiveness and the elements that increase this. Leaders have been pointed to as critical factors in team performance and effectiveness; some have even gone as far as to say they the most important ingredient for team effectiveness.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Additionally, problems associated with team leaders are often cited as the primary reason for failures of work involving teams.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nWith the complexity and ambiguity of tasks that teams often experience, it is becoming more apparent that a single leader is unlikely to have all of the skills and traits to effectively perform the necessary leadership functions.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref> Shared leadership has been identified as the optimal model of leadership when the knowledge characteristics of interdependence, creativity, and complexity <ref>Pearce (2004). The future of leadership: Combining vertical and shared leadership to transform knowledge work. ''Academy of Management Executive'', 18, 1, 47-57.</ref> are encountered.  Thus, shared leadership is becoming increasingly popular in teams, as multiple team members emerge as leaders, especially when they have the skills/knowledge/expertise that the team needs.\n\n== Measuring ==\nThere are two main ways that most researchers measure the existence and extent of shared leadership in a team: Ratings of the team's collective leadership behavior and Social Network Analysis. A less common technique of measuring shared leadership is with the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales.\n\n=== Ratings of team's collective leadership behavior ===\nMany studies measure shared leadership as team member perceptions of leader behavior exhibited by respective team leaders and team members.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2001</ref> Often this is done by distributing leader behavior questionnaires (surveys aimed at measuring the existence and frequency of different leader behaviors) to all members of a team. Team members are instructed to fill these out once for the appointed leader and then again for all other team members. Although this allows leadership quantity to be assessed, it does not pinpoint how many other team members are engaging in leadership behaviors or how many members are looking to the same people for leadership.\n\n=== Social network analysis ===\n[[Social network analysis]] (SNA) addresses some of the flaws of collective leader behavior ratings by assessing the patterns of connections that emerge in a team and providing a method for modeling both vertical and shared leadership within a team. SNA examines the relationships that form between individuals and uses these relationships as the units of analysis. In the leadership domain, a relationship, or \"tie\" as it is referred to in SNA literature, occurs when one team member perceives another as exerting leadership influence on the team. The proportion of actual ties that exist in a team to all potential ties that could have emerged in a team is called network density and can be used as a measure of shared leadership.<ref>Mehra, A., Smith, B. R., Dixon, A. L., & Robertson, B. (2006) Distributed leadership in teams: The network of leadership perceptions and team performance. ''The Leadership Quarterly'', 17, 3, 232-245</ref>\n\nSome researchers go further into SNA and analyze a network's centralization, which helps assess the distribution of leadership, as well as the quantity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Rentsch | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = Shared Leadership in Teams: A Matter of Distribution | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 203\u2013211 | doi = 10.1027/1866-5888/a000017 }}</ref>  Network centralization is measured using [[centrality]] values that are calculated for each individual. A centrality value for an individual represents the number of connections that individual has with others. The sum of the differences between the maximum individual centrality value and every other individual centrality value, divided by the maximum possible sum of differences, produces a measure of network centralization between 0 and 1, which describes the extent to which connections are concentrated around one individual, or if multiple individuals are central to the leadership network.\n\nA shared leadership network can be further separated into distributed-coordinated or distributed-fragmented by SNA.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>  This distinction depends on whether the formal and emergent leaders in a network recognize each other as leaders and are able to coordinate and lead together efficiently.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) ===\nSome studies have sought to measure shared leadership through observations of actual leadership behaviors. [[Behaviorally anchored rating scales]] (BARS) are commonly used to assess and rate performances, and can be developed to assess different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012), for example, developed such a scale and had trained raters watch videotapes of team interactions and rate each team member's behavior in terms of the dimensions on the BARS. They then operationalized shared leadership as the number of members who performed leadership behaviors, as well as the amount of leadership behavior exhibited by the team (calculated by aggregating the leadership ratings for each team member to the team level).<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each measurement technique. Although all are attempting to measure the same phenomenon and all have been used in published studies, the particular measure that a researcher uses can impact his or her results.\n\n== Antecedents: internal and external conditions ==\nA host of scholars who have studied shared leadership found that in order for the dynamic to properly emerge, two preconditions must be met. First, team members must actually be willing to extend their feedback to the team in a way that aims to influence and motivate the direction of the group. Second, the team must overall be disposed to accept and rely on such feedback by other team members.<ref>Katz, D., & Kahn, R. L. (1978).</ref> The preconditions specified by Katz and Kahn (1978) tend to be met by leadership sharing in teams by the development of interpersonal alliances (measured by LMX-TEAM) between and among participants as several meta-analyses reported.<ref>Graen, G. B. (2013). The Oxford Handbook of Leadership, Oxford: Oxford University Press (Graen, G. B. (2013. The Social Psychology of Organizations, 2nd Ed. London: Wiley</ref> Carson et al. (2007) expanded these two requirements by describing them in a larger, two-part framework that includes the degree to which a strong internal team environment exists and the extent to which positive external team [[coaching]] occurs.<ref>Carson et al</ref>\n\n=== Internal team environment ===\nCarson et al. (2007) propose first that shared leadership is facilitated by an overall team environment that consists of three dimensions: shared purpose, social support, and voice. The three concepts are also drawn from a wide body of literature:\n\n* '''Shared [[purpose]]''' prevails when team members have similar understandings of their team's main objectives and take steps to ensure a focus on collective goals.\n* '''[[Social support]]''' is the extent to which team members actively provide emotional and psychological strength to one another. This may occur through overt acts of encouragement or expressed recognition of other team members' contributions and accomplishments.\n* '''[[Advice (opinion)|Voice]]''' is the degree to which a team's members have input into how the team carries out its purpose.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe three dimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, thereby \"representing a high order construct.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref> Carson et al. summarize the [[interconnectivity]] of these three concepts in a concise narrative: \nWhen team members are able to speak up and get involved (voice), the likelihood that many of them will exercise leadership increases greatly. The opportunity for voice also facilitates shared leadership by strengthening both a common sense of direction and the potential for positive interpersonal support in a team. When teams are focused on collective goals (shared purpose), there is a greater sense of meaning and increased motivation for team members to both speak up and invest themselves in providing leadership to the team and to respond to the leadership of others. The motivation to participate and provide input toward achieving common goals and a common purpose can also be reinforced by an encouraging and supportive climate. When team members feel recognized and supported within their team (social support) they are more willing to share responsibility, cooperate, and commit to the team's collective [[goal]]s. Thus, these three dimensions work together to create an internal team environment that is characterized by a shared understanding about purpose and goals, a sense of recognition and importance, and high levels of involvement, challenge, and cooperation.<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref>\n\n=== External team coaching ===\nScholars have also described the important role that external team leaders and support can have in the development of shared leadership.<ref>Manz, C. C., & Sims H. P. Jr. (1987). Leading worker to lead themselves: The external leadership for self-managing work team. ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 106-129.</ref>  When framing this dynamic or antecedent, scholars have stressed the importance of external [[coaching]] behaviors. One scholar defines these coaching behaviors as: \"direct interaction with a team intended to help team members make coordinated and task-appropriate use of their collective resources in accomplishing the team's task.\"<ref>Hackman, J. R., & Wageman, R. (2005). A theory of team coaching. ''Academy of Management Review'', 30,p. 269</ref> Researchers have identified two types of team coaching\u2014distinguishing between those that reinforce shared leadership (supportive [[coaching]]) and those that focus on identifying team problems through task [[interventions]] (functional approach).<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Through supportive coaching, external team managers can reinforce the development of shared leadership in a variety of ways. Through active encouragement and [[positive reinforcement]] of team members who demonstrate leadership, coaching can foster independence and a sense of self-competence nurtures among team members. Coaching can also nurture collective commitment to the team and its objectives, a shared promise that can reduce free riding and increase the possibility that team members will demonstrate personal initiative.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nA second, more indirect, way that external [[coaching]] may positively encourage shared leadership is based on a functional approach. Within this approach, the role of an external team leader is to do whatever is not being adequately managed by the team itself, to \"intervene on behalf of an incomplete task.\" This functional coaching can be redundant when teams have highly supportive internal environments and therefore are less critical to the overall development of shared leadership. When interventions are necessary, however, such as when teams lack a strong shared purpose, the functional approach asserts that this kind of external influence may be particularly important. In this sense, the functional approach can be understood as providing \"motivational and consultative functions that enable shared leadership but have not been adequately developed by the team internally.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1224</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\nThough there is an ongoing debate about the existence and importance of shared leadership, many studies have shown that shared leadership is a significant predictor for various team processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Team effectiveness/performance ===\nA commonly explored consequence of shared leadership is team effectiveness or [[job performance|team performance]], which can be measured either by self-reports of team members or by outsider ratings, such as supervisor or client ratings.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2002</ref>  Performance is also sometimes measured more objectively, by using a commonly agreed-upon scale or rubric to rate the execution of a task. Many studies have found a positive relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness and performance.<ref>Sivasubramaniam, N., Murray, W. D., Avolio, B. J., & Jung, D. I. (2002). A longitudinal model of the effects of team leadership and group potency on group performance ''Group & Organization Management'' 2, 1, 66-96; Carson et al, 2007</ref> Similarly, other studies have explored the extent to which shared leadership can predict a team's effectiveness or performance, and have found that it is a significant predictor\u2014often a better predictor than vertical leadership.<ref>Pearce and Sims, 2002; Pearce et al, 2004; Ensley, Hmieleski, & Pearce, 2006</ref>\nA meta-analysis by Nicolaides and colleagues (2014) found that one reason why shared leadership relates to performance is through increasing team confidence. The researchers also found that shared leadership contributed to performance, over and above the effects of vertical leadership.<ref>Nicolaides, V. C., LaPort, K. A., Chen, T. R., Tomassetti, A. J., Weis, E. J., Zaccaro, S. J., & Cortina, J. M. (2014). The shared leadership of teams: A meta-analysis of proximal, distal, and moderating relationships. ''The Leadership Quarterly'', 25(5), 923-942.</ref>\n\nThe causes for this positive effect on [[team effectiveness]] lie in feeling empowered through the perceived responsibility and self-control in the context of shared leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dumaine|first=Brian|title=The Trouble with Teams|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ487492|journal=Fortune|language=en|volume=130|issue=5|pages=86|issn=0015-8259}}</ref> This results in more engagement of the team members, more team [[Group cohesiveness|cohesion]], [[Psychological safety|trust]], a higher level of consensus and satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=Jacqueline Z.|last2=Rentsch|first2=Joan R.|last3=Small|first3=Erika E.|last4=Davenport|first4=Shaun W.|last5=Bergman|first5=Shawn M.|date=2012-01-01|title=The Shared Leadership Process in Decision-Making Teams|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=152|issue=1|pages=17\u201342|doi=10.1080/00224545.2010.538763|issn=0022-4545|pmid=22308759}}</ref>\n\nAs discussed in the measurement section of this article, the technique used to measure shared leadership can influence the results that are found. For example, Mehra et al. (2006) first compared teams with a distributed (shared) leadership structure to teams with a more traditional (vertical) leadership structure. In contrast to other studies, they did not find that teams with shared leadership outperformed the traditional teams. However, when they separated the distributed teams into distributed-coordinated and distributed-fragmented (see measures section), they found that distributed-coordinated team structures were associated with higher performance than both traditional leader-centered teams and distributed-fragmented leadership networks. Thus, they theorized, having more leaders is not the only factor that matters to team performance; rather, leaders must recognize other leaders as such in order for them to contribute positively to team effectiveness.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Number and types of leadership ===\nNot surprisingly, shared leadership has been shown to increase the number and types of leadership (for example, [[transformational leadership]]; [[transactional leadership]]; [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|and consideration and initiating structure]]).\u00b7<ref>Bergman et al, 2012; Pearce and Sims, 2002</ref>   Shared leadership enables team members to express their different abilities, thus letting members of a team exhibit different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012) found that teams did, in fact, experience more types of leadership behaviors when multiple members of the team participated in the team's leadership. Additionally, they found that each leader only effectively engaged in one type of leadership, indicating that shared leadership lets more leadership behaviors be expressed than vertical leadership.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\n=== In schools ===\nThe effect of shared leadership at school is contingent on the key players involved and how they view their missions. Conflicting thoughts on how shared leadership influences [[student engagement]] result in a variety of interpretations by researchers. Sharing leadership also impacts how teachers interact with one another, whether they possess relationships where they reinforce one another or feel distant from the organization.\n\nOne view is that sharing leadership among more people does not necessarily bring positive student outcomes. Some researchers have called the influence of shared leadership into question, suggesting that the influence of shared leadership is statistically non-significant ([[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] & Jantzi, 1999),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Jantzi | first2 = D. | year = 1999 | title = The relative effects of principal and teacher sources of leadership on student engagement with school | url = | journal = Educational administration quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 679\u2013706 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x99355002 }}</ref> and indicating that shared leadership is \"not a significant factor for students' participation in or engagement with school\" (Silins et al., 2002).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Mulford | first2 = W. R. | last3 = Zarins | first3 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Organizational learning and school change | url = | journal = Educational Administration Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 613\u2013642 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x02239641 }}</ref> Timperley (2005, p.&nbsp;417) also underlines the significance of promoting the quality of shared leadership activities, emphasizing that shared leadership has risks associated with \"greater distribution of incompetence.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Timperley | first1 = H. S. | year = 2005 | title = Distributed leadership: Developing theory from practice | url = | journal = Journal of curriculum studies | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 395\u2013420 | doi = 10.1080/00220270500038545 }}</ref>\n\nConversely, it has been argued that shared leadership is positively related to students' achievement. In addition, shared leadership enables teachers to employ certain methodologies or instructional content. [[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] and Mascall(2008) conclude that shared leadership eventually influences students' math achievement indirectly by effecting teacher motivation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Mascall | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Collective leadership effects on student achievement | url = | journal = Educational Administration Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 529\u2013561 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x08321221 }}</ref> Similarly, a study by Heck and Hallinger(2009) shows that the development of school shared leadership has an indirect impact on students' academic growth in math, mutually reinforcing academic capacity of teachers and students over time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heck | first1 = R. H. | last2 = Hallinger | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = ''Assessing the contribution of distributed leadership to school improvement and growth in math achievement. ''American | url = | journal = Educational Research Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 659\u2013689 | doi = 10.3102/0002831209340042 }}</ref> Researchers and writers, such as Camburn and Han(2009), have also remarked that widespread leadership promotes teachers exposure to plentiful instructional resources and the likelihood that they will employ these instruction practices. Camburn and Han's study (2009), however, does not present empirical evidence that shared leadership is associated with students' outcomes.<ref>Camburn, E. M., & Han, S. W. (2009). ''Investigating connections'' ''between distributed leadership and instructional change (pp. 25-45).'' Springer Netherlands.</ref>\n\nOther research focused on the impact of shared leadership notes the teacher perceptions. Work by Hulpia and Devos (2010) reveals that leadership practices such as the sharing of leadership roles, social interaction, cooperation of the leadership team, and inclusive decision-making, positively reinforce teachers' [[Organizational commitment|commitment to the organization.]]<ref>Hulpia, H., & Devos, G. (2010). How distributed leadership can make a difference in teachers' organizational commitment? A qualitative study. ''Teaching and'' Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies'', 26 (3),'' 565-575.</ref> It has been underscored that teachers' academic optimism, which refer to trust, teacher [[efficacy]], and [[organizational citizenship behavior]] as well, are heavily and positively associated with planned approaches to leadership distribution (Mascall et al.,2008)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mascall | first1 = B. | last2 = Leithwood | first2 = K. | last3 = Straus | first3 = T. | last4 = Sacks | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = ''The relationship between distributed leadership and teachers' academic optimism.

Shared traditional leadership refers to a task-oriented, [[Transactional leadership|transactional form of leadership]], which emphasizes maintaining the status quo. Shared new-genre leadership however focuses on [[transformational leadership]] and therefore a more inspirational, visionary, growth and change-oriented kind of leadership. Lastly, cumulative, overall leadership was assessed based on individual members\u2019 ratings of leadership influence for each of his/her peers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThe studies showed that both shared new-genre leadership and cumulative, overall shared leadership show a stronger relationship with team effectiveness than shared traditional leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Work complexity ====\nWork complexity (also known as job complexity) acts as a moderator of the shared leadership-team effectiveness relationship, namely that the relationship is stronger when work is more complex compared with when it is less complex. This can be explained by the higher interdependence, coordination and information sharing that is necessary when work complexity is high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n== Implications and further research directions ==\nScholars have pointed to 4 main areas in shared leadership that need more research: \n# Events that generate shared leadership\n# Facilitation factors\n# Most conducive influence approaches\n# Stages and life cycles in shared leadership settings (Carson et al., 2007; Pearce and Conger, 2002).\nAdditionally, more scholarship must be done on outcomes of shared leadership. The spike of recent scholarship in this field does indicate that scholars increasingly understand the significance of shared leadership as organizations in the field are also increasingly capitalizing on the many benefits a shared leadership approach can offer.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Group development]]\n* [[Group dynamics]]\n* [[Human resources]]\n* [[Leadership development]]\n* [[Leadership studies]]\n* [[Organizational development]]\n* [[Team building]]\n* [[Team composition]]\n* [[Three levels of leadership model]]\n* [[Trait leadership]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n# Bass, B.
