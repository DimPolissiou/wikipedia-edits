The battle began with the launch of the German offensive [[Operation Citadel]] ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Zitadelle}}), on 5 July, which had the objective of pinching off the Kursk [[Salient (military)|salient]] with attacks on the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. After the German offensive stalled on the northern side of the salient, on 12 July the Soviets commenced their '''Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation''' with the launch of [[Operation Kutuzov]] ({{lang-ru|\u041a\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432}}) against the rear of the German forces in the northern side. On the southern side, the Soviets also launched powerful counterattacks the same day, one of which led to a large armoured clash, the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]]. On 3 August, the Soviets began the second phase of the Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of [[Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev]] ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432}}) against the German forces in the southern side of the Kursk salient.\n\nThe battle was the final strategic offensive that the Germans were able to launch on the Eastern Front. Because the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began during the battle, [[Adolf Hitler]] was forced to have troops training in France diverted to meet the Allied threat in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front.<ref>Dunn Jr., Walter S.

Aware months in advance that the attack would fall on the neck of the Kursk salient, the Soviets built a [[defence in depth]] designed to wear down the German [[armoured spearhead]].{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=65}} The Germans delayed the offensive while they tried to build up their forces and waited for new weapons, mainly the new [[Panther tank|Panther]] tank but also larger numbers of the [[Tiger I|Tiger]] heavy tank.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Dunn|1997|p=94}}{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=16}}  This gave the Red Army time to construct a series of deep defensive belts.

By January 1943, a {{convert|160|to|300|km|abbr=on}} wide gap had opened between [[Army Group B#Eastern Front|Army Group B]] and [[Army Group Don]], and the advancing Soviet armies threatened to cut off all German forces south of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], including [[Army Group A]] operating in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=167}} [[Army Group Center]] came under significant pressure as well.

He received an approval from Hitler for a counteroffensive against the Soviet forces advancing in the Donbass region.{{sfn|Citino|2012|pp=66\u201367}} On 12 February 1943, the remaining German forces were reorganised. To the south, Army Group Don was renamed Army Group South and placed under Manstein's command. Directly to the north, Army Group B was dissolved, with its forces and areas of responsibility divided between Army Group South and Army Group Centre. Manstein inherited responsibility for the massive breach in the German lines.{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=8}} On 18 February, Hitler arrived at Army Group South headquarters at [[Zaporizhia]] just hours before the Soviets liberated [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], and had to be hastily evacuated on the 19th.{{sfn|Citino|2012|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nOnce given freedom of action, Manstein intended to utilise his forces to make a series of counterstrokes into the flanks of the Soviet armoured formations, with the goal of destroying them while retaking Kharkov and Kursk.{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=177}} The [[II SS Panzer Corps]] had arrived from France in January 1943, refitted and up to near full strength.{{sfn|Dunn|1997|p=61}} Armoured units from the [[1st Panzer Army]] of Army Group A had pulled out of the Caucasus and further strengthened Manstein's forces.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=13}}\n\nThe operation was hastily prepared and did not receive a name. Later known as [[Third Battle of Kharkov]], it commenced on 21 February, as 4th Panzer Army under General Hoth launched a counter-attack. The German forces cut off the Soviet mobile spearheads and continued the drive north,{{sfn|Citino|2012|pp=68\u201370}} retaking Kharkov on 15 March and [[Belgorod]] on 18 March.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=177}} A Soviet offensive launched on 25 February by the Central Front against Army Group Centre had to be abandoned by 7 March to allow the attacking formations to disengage and redeploy to the south to counter the threat of the advancing German forces under Manstein.{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=11, 13}} Exhaustion of both the Wehrmacht and the [[Red Army]] coupled with the loss of mobility due to the onset of the spring [[rasputitsa]] resulted in the cessation of operations for both sides by mid-March.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=178}} The counteroffensive left a salient extending into the German area of control, centered on the city of Kursk.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=178}}\n\n=== German plans and preparation ===\n[[File:Kursk-1943-Plan-GE.svg|thumb|German plan of attack]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Zschaeckel-206-35, Schlacht um Kursk, Panzer VI (Tiger I).jpg|thumb|Troops of [[Division Das Reich]], [[Tiger I tank]], in June 1943 before the battle]]\nThe heavy losses sustained by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]] (army) since the opening of [[Operation Barbarossa]] had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=43}} Units were in total 470,000 men understrength.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=374}} For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943, the burden of the offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and holding ground on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=262}} On 10 March, Manstein presented a plan whereby the German forces would pinch off the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring [[rasputitsa]] had subsided.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=184}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=14}}\n\nOn 13 March, Hitler signed Operational Order No. 5, which authorised several offensives, including one against the Kursk salient.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=186}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=354}} As the last Soviet resistance in Kharkov petered out, Manstein attempted to persuade [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], commander of Army Group Centre, to immediately attack the Central Front, which was defending the northern face of the salient. Kluge refused, believing that his forces were too weak to launch such an attack.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=14}} Further Axis advances were blocked by Soviet forces that had been shifted down from the Central Front to the area north of Belgorod.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=177}} By mid-April, amid poor weather and with the German forces exhausted and in need of refitting, the offensives of Operational Order No. 5 were postponed.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=13}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=178, 186}}\n\nOn 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, which called for the Kursk offensive operation, codenamed ''Zitadelle'' (\"Citadel\"), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter. The directive was drafted by [[Kurt Zeitzler]], the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] Chief of Staff.{{sfn|Citino|2012|p=121}} For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets had a chance to prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=187}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=25}} Some military historians have described the operation using the term [[blitzkrieg]] (lightning war);{{efn|name=Blitzkrieg}} other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.{{efn|name=No Blitzkrieg}}\n\nOperation Citadel called for a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]], directed at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off the salient.{{sfn|Nipe|1998}} Army Group Centre would provide General [[Walter Model]]'s [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] to form the northern pincer. It would cut through the northern face of the salient, driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=13}} Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army, under [[Hermann Hoth]], and [[Army Detachment Kempf]], under [[Werner Kempf]], to pierce the southern face of the salient. This force would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk.{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=194,196}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=51\u201353}} Manstein's main attack was to be delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, spearheaded by the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] under [[Paul Hausser]]. The [[XLVIII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVIII Panzer Corps]], commanded by [[Otto von Knobelsdorff]], would advance on the left while Army Detachment ''Kempf'' would advance on the right.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=197}} The [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]], under the command of [[Walter Wei\u00df|Walter Weiss]], would contain the western portion of the salient.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=194}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nOn 27 April, Model met with Hitler to review and express his concern for reconnaissance information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at the shoulders of the salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=79}} He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=193}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=1\u20133}} Though in mid-April, Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=187}}\n\nHitler called his senior officers and advisors to [[Munich]] for a meeting on 4 May. Hitler spoke for about 45 minutes on the reasons to postpone the attack, essentially reiterating Model's arguments.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=49}} A number of options were put forth for comment: going on the offensive immediately with the forces at hand, delaying the offensive further to await the arrival of new and better tanks, radically revising the operation or cancelling it altogether. Manstein advocated an early attack, but requested two additional infantry divisions, to which Hitler responded that none were available.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=49}} Kluge spoke out strongly against postponement and discounted Model's reconnaissance materials.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|pp=49\u201350}} [[Albert Speer]], the minister of Armaments and War Production, spoke about the difficulties of rebuilding the armoured formations and the limitations of German industry to replace losses. General [[Heinz Guderian]] argued strongly against the operation, stating \"the attack was pointless\".{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=50}} The conference ended without Hitler coming to a decision, but Citadel was not aborted.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=50}} Three days later, [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]], Hitler's conduit for controlling the military, postponed the launch date for Citadel to 12 June.{{sfn|Glantz|2013|p=183}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=192}}\n\n[[File:091220 guderian.jpg|thumb|Guderian being transported to the Eastern Front, 1943]]\n\nFollowing this meeting, Guderian continued to voice his concerns over an operation that would likely degrade the panzer forces that he had been attempting to rebuild. He considered the offensive, as planned, to be a misuse of the panzer forces, as it violated two of the three tenets he had laid out as the essential elements for a successful panzer attack.{{efn|name=Achtung Panzer!}} In his opinion, the limited German resources in men and [[materiel]] should be conserved, as they would be needed for the pending defence of western Europe. In a meeting with Hitler on 10 May he asked,\n\n{{quote|\nIs it really necessary to attack Kursk, and indeed in the east this year at all? Do you think anyone even knows where Kursk is? The entire world doesn't care if we capture Kursk or not. What is the reason that is forcing us to attack this year on Kursk, or even more, on the Eastern Front?\n}}\n\nHitler replied, \"I know. The thought of it turns my stomach.\" Guderian concluded, \"In that case your reaction to the problem is the correct one. Leave it alone.\"{{sfn|Guderian|1952|p=308}}{{efn|name=Guderian}}\n\nDespite reservations, Hitler remained committed to the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east.

However, the T-34 made up the bulk of the Soviet armour.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=172}} Without including the deeper reserves organised under the Steppe Front, the Soviets massed about 1,300,000 men, 3,600 tanks, 20,000 artillery pieces and 2,792 aircraft to defend the salient.{{sfn|Taylor|Kulish|1974|p=168}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=204|loc=provides similar but more specific figures}} This amounted to 26 percent of the total manpower of the Red Army, 26 percent of its mortars and artillery, 35 percent of its aircraft and 46 percent of its tanks.{{sfn|Taylor|Kulish|1974|p=168}}\n\n=== Contest for air superiority ===\nBy 1943 the [[Luftwaffe]]'s strength on the Eastern Front had started to weaken after [[Operation Uranus|Stalingrad]], and the siphoning of resources to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].{{sfn|Muller|1992|p=106}} The Luftwaffe forces in the east were further depleted with [[Jagdgeschwader|fighter units]] being shifted back to Germany to defend against the escalating [[Defense of the Reich|Allied bombing campaign]].{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=471\u2013472}} By the end of June, only 38.7 percent of the Luftwaffe's total aircraft remained in the east.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=158}} In 1943 the Luftwaffe could still achieve local air superiority by concentrating its forces. The majority of German aircraft left available on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were slated for Citadel.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=472}} The goal of the Luftwaffe remained unchanged. The priority of the German air fleet(s) was to gain [[air superiority]], then to [[Air interdiction|isolate the battlefield]] from enemy reinforcements, and finally, once the critical point had been reached in the land battle, to render [[close air support]].<ref>{{harvnb|Corum|1995|pp=53\u201376}}</ref>\n[[File:RIAN archive 225 IL-2 attacking.jpg|thumb|[[Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily|VVS]] [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ground attack aircraft during the battle of Kursk.]]\n\nThe changing strengths between the two opponents prompted the Luftwaffe to make operational changes for the battle. Previous offensive campaigns had been initiated with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority. By this point in the war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced, making such raids futile. Therefore, this mission was abandoned. In addition, previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying well behind the frontline to block the arrival of reinforcements. This mission, however, was rarely attempted during Citadel.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=186}}\n\nThe Luftwaffe command understood that their support would be crucial for the success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft that could be used to replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=160}} Fuel was the most significant limiting factor.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=159}} To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=104}} Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=103}}\n\nFor Citadel, the Luftwaffe confined its operations to the direct support of the forces on the ground.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=105}} In this mission the Luftwaffe continued to make use of the [[Junkers Ju 87]] \"Stuka\" dive-bombers. A new development to this aircraft was the [[BK 37|\"Bordkanone\" 3,7&nbsp;cm]] calibre cannon, one of which could be slung under each wing of the Stuka in a [[gun pod]]. Half of the Stuka groups assigned to support Citadel were equipped with these ''Kanonenvogel'' (literally \"cannon-bird\") tankbuster aircraft.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|pp=79\u201381, 102, 106, 114, 118}} The air groups were also strengthened by the recent arrival of the [[Henschel Hs 129]], with its 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 103 cannon]], and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190#Ground attack versions|the F-subtype]] ground attack (\"jabo\") version of the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]].{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=104}}\n\nIn the months preceding the battle, [[Luftflotte 6]] supporting Army Group Center noted a marked increase in the strength of the opposing VVS formations. The VVS formations encountered displayed better training, and were flying improved equipment with greater aggressiveness and skill than the Luftwaffe had seen earlier.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=155}} The introduction of the [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-5]] fighters gave the Soviet pilots near parity with the Luftwaffe in terms of equipment. Furthermore, large numbers of ground-attack aircraft, such as the [[Ilyushin Il-2|Ilyushin Il-2 \"Shturmovik\"]] and the [[Petlyakov Pe-2|Pe-2]], had become available as well. The Soviet Air Force also fielded large numbers of aircraft supplied via lend-lease. Huge stockpiles of supplies and ample reserves of replacement aircraft meant the Red Army and VVS formations would be able to conduct an extended campaign without slackening in the intensity of their effort.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=186}}\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{see also|Battle of Kursk order of battle}}\n\n=== Germans ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-219-0596-12, Russland, Panzer IV und Sch\u00fctzenpanzer in Fahrt.jpg|thumb|German Panzer IV and Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack]]\nFor the operation, the Germans used four armies along with a large portion of their total tank strength on the Eastern Front.

In total, the German forces had a total strength of 777,000\u2013779,000 men, and the three attacking armies contained 438,271 combat soldiers.{{sfn|Frieser|2007|p=112}}{{sfn|Zetterling|Frankson|2000|p=18}} Army Group South was equipped with more [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]], infantry and artillery than the 9th Army of Army Group Center.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=196}}{{sfn|Zetterling|Frankson|2000|p=18}} The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment \"Kempf\" had 1,377&nbsp;tanks and assault guns, while the 9th Army possessed 988&nbsp;tanks and assault guns.{{sfn|Frieser|2007|p=112}}\n\nGerman industry produced 2,816 tanks and self-propelled guns between April and June, of which 156 were Tigers and 484 Panthers. At Kursk, a total of 259 Panther tanks, about 211 Tigers, and 90 Ferdinands were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/armysappersforward/kursk.htm|title=WWII Battle of Kursk: Mine/Countermine operations|work=oocities.org|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe two new Panther battalions \u2013 the 51st and 52nd \u2013 together equipped with 200 Panthers, for which the offensive had been delayed, were attached to the [[Panzer-Grenadier-Division Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division]] in the XLVIII Panzer Corps of Army Group South. With the 51st and 52nd Battalions arriving on 30 June and 1 July, the two units had little time to perform reconnaissance or to orient themselves to the terrain they found themselves in.

The two battalions came direct from the training ground and lacked combat experience.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=201}}{{sfn|Nipe|2011|p=143}} In addition, the requirement to maintain radio silence until the start of the attack meant that the Panther units had little training in battalion-level radio procedures.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=201}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=237}} Furthermore, the new Panthers were still experiencing problems with their transmissions, and proved mechanically unreliable.

The Central and Voronezh Fronts fielded 12 armies, with 711,575 men (510,983 combat soldiers) and 625,591 men (446,236 combat soldiers) respectively. In reserve, the Steppe Front had an additional 573,195 men (449,133). Thus the total size of the Soviet force was 1,910,361 men, with 1,426,352 actual combat soldiers.\n\nSoviet armour strength included 4,869 tanks (including 205 [[KV-1]]s heavy tank) and 259 SPGs (including 25 [[SU-152]]s, 56 [[SU-122]]s and 67 [[SU-76]]s)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/wi2/foto/ww2/proh/page4.html |title = Strengths and Losses}}</ref> Overall a third of the Soviet tanks at Kursk were [[light tanks]], but in some units this proportion was considerably higher. Of the 3,600 tanks in the Central and Voronezh Fronts in July 1943, 1,061 were light as [[T-60]] and [[T-70]]. With very thin armour and small guns, they were unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of German medium and heavy tanks or [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter S.

Only the [[SU-122]] and [[SU-152]] self-propelled guns had the power to destroy the Tiger at short range, but they were not equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122s and SU-152s at Kursk.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Order of battle: hi my name is bob\n Central Front (Army General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]){{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=478\u2013484}}h\n|-\n!

Most of the division's tank losses occurred late in the afternoon as they advanced through mine fields against well-hidden Soviet anti-tank guns. Although the 3rd SS succeeded in reaching the Karteschewka-Prokhorovka road, their hold was tenuous and it cost the division half of its armour. The majority of German tank losses suffered at Prokhorovka occurred here. To the south, the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps had been thrown back by the 1st SS Panzer Division. The 2nd SS Panzer Division also repelled attacks from the 2nd Tank Corps and the [[2nd Guards Tank Corps]].{{sfn|Nipe|2011|p=341}} Luftwaffe local air superiority over the battlefield also contributed to the Soviet losses, partly due to the VVS being directed against the German units on the flanks of II SS Panzer Corps.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|pp=79\u201380}} By the end of the day, the Soviets had fallen back to their starting positions.{{sfn|Brand|2003}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-219-0553A-07, Russland, bei Pokrowka, ersch\u00f6pfte Soldaten.jpg|thumb|German soldiers pause during the fighting.]]\n\nNeither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives.

The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to stop the offensive and move forces from Kursk to Italy. Kluge welcomed the news, as he was aware that the Soviets were initiating a massive counter-offensive against his sector but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein's forces had just spent a week fighting through a maze of defensive works and he believed they were on the verge of breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, \"On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [has] committed [are] completely beaten\".{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=354}} Hitler agreed temporarily to allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient but the following day he ordered Manstein's reserve \u2013 the XXIV Panzer Corps \u2013 to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=355}}\n\nThe offensive continued in the southern part with the launch of [[Operation Roland]] on 14 July.

As the German momentum in the north slowed, the Soviets launched Operation Kutusov on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient, directly north of the Kursk salient. The [[Bryansk Front]], under the command of [[Markian Popov]], attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]], commanded by [[Vasily Sokolovsky]], attacked from the north. The Western Front's assault was led by the [[11th Guards Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Hovhannes Bagramyan]], and was supported by the 1st and 5th Tank Corps. The Soviet spearheads sustained heavy casualties, but pushed through and in some areas achieved significant penetrations.

For the first time, a major German offensive had been stopped before achieving a breakthrough. The Germans, despite using more technologically advanced armour than in previous years, were unable to break through the in-depth Soviet defences and were caught off guard by the significant operational reserves of the Red Army. This result changed the pattern of operations on the Eastern Front, with the Soviet Union gaining the operational initiative. The Soviet victory was costly, with the Red Army losing considerably more men and [[materiel]] than the German Army.

By the evening of 10 July there were only 10 operational Panthers in the frontline. 25 Panthers had been lost as total writeoffs (23 were hit and burnt and two had caught fire during the approach march). 100 Panthers were in need of repair (56 were damaged by hits and mines and 44 by mechanical breakdown). 60 percent of the mechanical breakdowns could be easily repaired. Approximately 40 Panthers had already been repaired and were on the way to the front. About 25 still had not been recovered by the repair service... On the evening of 11 July, 38 Panthers were operational, 31 were total writeoffs and 131 were in need of repair. A slow increase in the combat strength is observable. The large number of losses by hits (81 Panthers up to 10 July) attests to the heavy fighting.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995, pp. 130\u2013132\"/>}}\n\nBy 16 July, Army Group South claimed 161&nbsp;tanks and 14 assault guns lost. Up to 14 July, 9th Army reported they had lost as total writeoffs 41&nbsp;tanks and 17 assault guns. These losses break down as 109 Panzer IVs, 42 Panthers, 38 Panzer IIIs, 31 assault guns, 19 ''Elefant''s, 10 Tigers and three [[flame tank]]s.{{sfn|Frieser|2007|p=151}} Before the Germans ended their offensive at Kursk, the Soviets began their counteroffensive and succeeded in pushing the Germans back into a steady retreat. Thus, a report on 11 August 1943 showed that the numbers of total writeoffs in Panthers swelled to 156, with only 9 operational. The German Army was forced into a fighting retreat and increasingly lost tanks in combat as well as from abandoning and destroying damaged vehicles.<ref name=\"Jentz 1995 p. 134\">{{harvnb|Jentz|1995|p=134}}</ref> Across the entire Eastern Front 50 Tiger tanks were lost during July and August, with some 240 damaged.

The battle began with the launch of the German offensive [[Operation Citadel]] ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Zitadelle}}), on 5 July, which had the objective of pinching off the Kursk [[Salient (military)|salient]] with attacks on the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. After the German offensive stalled on the northern side of the salient, on 12 July the Soviets commenced their '''Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation''' with the launch of [[Operation Kutuzov]] ({{lang-ru|\u041a\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432}}) against the rear of the German forces in the northern side. On the southern side, the Soviets also launched powerful counterattacks the same day, one of which led to a large armoured clash, the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]]. On 3 August, the Soviets began the second phase of the Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of [[Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev]] ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432}}) against the German forces in the southern side of the Kursk salient.\n\nThe battle was the final strategic offensive that the Germans were able to launch on the Eastern Front. Because the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began during the battle, [[Adolf Hitler]] was forced to have troops training in France diverted to meet the Allied threat in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front.<ref>Dunn Jr., Walter S.

By January 1943, a {{convert|160|to|300|km|abbr=on}} wide gap had opened between [[Army Group B#Eastern Front|Army Group B]] and [[Army Group Don]], and the advancing Soviet armies threatened to cut off all German forces south of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], including [[Army Group A]] operating in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=167}} [[Army Group Center]] came under significant pressure as well.

He received an approval from Hitler for a counteroffensive against the Soviet forces advancing in the Donbass region.{{sfn|Citino|2012|pp=66\u201367}} On 12 February 1943, the remaining German forces were reorganised. To the south, Army Group Don was renamed Army Group South and placed under Manstein's command. Directly to the north, Army Group B was dissolved, with its forces and areas of responsibility divided between Army Group South and Army Group Centre. Manstein inherited responsibility for the massive breach in the German lines.{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=8}} On 18 February, Hitler arrived at Army Group South headquarters at [[Zaporizhia]] just hours before the Soviets liberated [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], and had to be hastily evacuated on the 19th.{{sfn|Citino|2012|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nOnce given freedom of action, Manstein intended to utilise his forces to make a series of counterstrokes into the flanks of the Soviet armoured formations, with the goal of destroying them while retaking Kharkov and Kursk.{{sfn|Kasdorf|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=177}} The [[II SS Panzer Corps]] had arrived from France in January 1943, refitted and up to near full strength.{{sfn|Dunn|1997|p=61}} Armoured units from the [[1st Panzer Army]] of Army Group A had pulled out of the Caucasus and further strengthened Manstein's forces.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=13}}\n\nThe operation was hastily prepared and did not receive a name. Later known as [[Third Battle of Kharkov]], it commenced on 21 February, as 4th Panzer Army under General Hoth launched a counter-attack.

Kluge refused, believing that his forces were too weak to launch such an attack.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=14}} Further Axis advances were blocked by Soviet forces that had been shifted down from the Central Front to the area north of Belgorod.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=177}} By mid-April, amid poor weather and with the German forces exhausted and in need of refitting, the offensives of Operational Order No. 5 were postponed.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=13}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=178, 186}}\n\nOn 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, which called for the Kursk offensive operation, codenamed ''Zitadelle'' (\"Citadel\"), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter. The directive was drafted by [[Kurt Zeitzler]], the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] Chief of Staff.{{sfn|Citino|2012|p=121}} For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets had a chance to prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=187}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=25}} Some military historians have described the operation using the term [[blitzkrieg]] (lightning war);{{efn|name=Blitzkrieg}} other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.{{efn|name=No Blitzkrieg}}\n\nOperation Citadel called for a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]], directed at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off the salient.{{sfn|Nipe|1998}} Army Group Centre would provide General [[Walter Model]]'s [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] to form the northern pincer. It would cut through the northern face of the salient, driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=13}} Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army, under [[Hermann Hoth]], and [[Army Detachment Kempf]], under [[Werner Kempf]], to pierce the southern face of the salient.

The [[XLVIII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVIII Panzer Corps]], commanded by [[Otto von Knobelsdorff]], would advance on the left while Army Detachment ''Kempf'' would advance on the right.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=197}} The [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]], under the command of [[Walter Wei\u00df|Walter Weiss]], would contain the western portion of the salient.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=194}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nOn 27 April, Model met with Hitler to review and express his concern for reconnaissance information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at the shoulders of the salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=79}} He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=193}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=1\u20133}} Though in mid-April, Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=187}}\n\nHitler called his senior officers and advisors to [[Munich]] for a meeting on 4 May. Hitler spoke for about 45 minutes on the reasons to postpone the attack, essentially reiterating Model's arguments.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=49}} A number of options were put forth for comment: going on the offensive immediately with the forces at hand, delaying the offensive further to await the arrival of new and better tanks, radically revising the operation or cancelling it altogether. Manstein advocated an early attack, but requested two additional infantry divisions, to which Hitler responded that none were available.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=49}} Kluge spoke out strongly against postponement and discounted Model's reconnaissance materials.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|pp=49\u201350}} [[Albert Speer]], the minister of Armaments and War Production, spoke about the difficulties of rebuilding the armoured formations and the limitations of German industry to replace losses. General [[Heinz Guderian]] argued strongly against the operation, stating \"the attack was pointless\".{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=50}} The conference ended without Hitler coming to a decision, but Citadel was not aborted.{{sfn|Showalter|2013|p=50}} Three days later, [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]], Hitler's conduit for controlling the military, postponed the launch date for Citadel to 12 June.{{sfn|Glantz|2013|p=183}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=192}}\n\n[[File:091220 guderian.jpg|thumb|Guderian being transported to the Eastern Front, 1943]]\n\nFollowing this meeting, Guderian continued to voice his concerns over an operation that would likely degrade the panzer forces that he had been attempting to rebuild. He considered the offensive, as planned, to be a misuse of the panzer forces, as it violated two of the three tenets he had laid out as the essential elements for a successful panzer attack.{{efn|name=Achtung Panzer!}} In his opinion, the limited German resources in men and [[materiel]] should be conserved, as they would be needed for the pending defence of western Europe. In a meeting with Hitler on 10 May he asked,\n\n{{quote|\nIs it really necessary to attack Kursk, and indeed in the east this year at all? Do you think anyone even knows where Kursk is? The entire world doesn't care if we capture Kursk or not. What is the reason that is forcing us to attack this year on Kursk, or even more, on the Eastern Front?\n}}\n\nHitler replied, \"I know.

Leave it alone.\"{{sfn|Guderian|1952|p=308}}{{efn|name=Guderian}}\n\nDespite reservations, Hitler remained committed to the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused more and more on the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the [[Panther tank]], but also the [[Elefant]] [[tank destroyer]] and greater numbers of the [[Tiger I|Tiger]] heavy tank.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=12}} He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=193}} Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.{{sfn|Clark|1966|p=327}}\n\nWith pessimism for Citadel increasing with each delay, in June, [[Alfred Jodl]], the Chief of Staff at the OKW, instructed the armed forces propaganda office to portray the upcoming operation as a limited counteroffensive.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2004|p=55}}{{sfn|Glantz|2013|p=183}}<ref>[https://archive.is/20130630034148/http://www.vy75.dial.pipex.com/news.htm \"Kursk Press releases July 1943\"].

However, the T-34 made up the bulk of the Soviet armour.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=172}} Without including the deeper reserves organised under the Steppe Front, the Soviets massed about 1,300,000 men, 3,600 tanks, 20,000 artillery pieces and 2,792 aircraft to defend the salient.{{sfn|Taylor|Kulish|1974|p=168}}{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=204|loc=provides similar but more specific figures}} This amounted to 26 percent of the total manpower of the Red Army, 26 percent of its mortars and artillery, 35 percent of its aircraft and 46 percent of its tanks.{{sfn|Taylor|Kulish|1974|p=168}}\n\n=== Contest for air superiority ===\nBy 1943 the [[Luftwaffe]]'s strength on the Eastern Front had started to weaken after [[Operation Uranus|Stalingrad]], and the siphoning of resources to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].{{sfn|Muller|1992|p=106}} The Luftwaffe forces in the east were further depleted with [[Jagdgeschwader|fighter units]] being shifted back to Germany to defend against the escalating [[Defense of the Reich|Allied bombing campaign]].{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=471\u2013472}} By the end of June, only 38.7 percent of the Luftwaffe's total aircraft remained in the east.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=158}} In 1943 the Luftwaffe could still achieve local air superiority by concentrating its forces. The majority of German aircraft left available on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were slated for Citadel.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=472}} The goal of the Luftwaffe remained unchanged.

Previous offensive campaigns had been initiated with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority. By this point in the war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced, making such raids futile. Therefore, this mission was abandoned. In addition, previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying well behind the frontline to block the arrival of reinforcements. This mission, however, was rarely attempted during Citadel.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=186}}\n\nThe Luftwaffe command understood that their support would be crucial for the success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft that could be used to replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=160}} Fuel was the most significant limiting factor.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=159}} To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=104}} Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=103}}\n\nFor Citadel, the Luftwaffe confined its operations to the direct support of the forces on the ground.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=105}} In this mission the Luftwaffe continued to make use of the [[Junkers Ju 87]] \"Stuka\" dive-bombers. A new development to this aircraft was the [[BK 37|\"Bordkanone\" 3,7&nbsp;cm]] calibre cannon, one of which could be slung under each wing of the Stuka in a [[gun pod]]. Half of the Stuka groups assigned to support Citadel were equipped with these ''Kanonenvogel'' (literally \"cannon-bird\") tankbuster aircraft.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|pp=79\u201381, 102, 106, 114, 118}} The air groups were also strengthened by the recent arrival of the [[Henschel Hs 129]], with its 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 103 cannon]], and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190#Ground attack versions|the F-subtype]] ground attack (\"jabo\") version of the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]].{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=104}}\n\nIn the months preceding the battle, [[Luftflotte 6]] supporting Army Group Center noted a marked increase in the strength of the opposing VVS formations. The VVS formations encountered displayed better training, and were flying improved equipment with greater aggressiveness and skill than the Luftwaffe had seen earlier.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=155}} The introduction of the [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-5]] fighters gave the Soviet pilots near parity with the Luftwaffe in terms of equipment. Furthermore, large numbers of ground-attack aircraft, such as the [[Ilyushin Il-2|Ilyushin Il-2 \"Shturmovik\"]] and the [[Petlyakov Pe-2|Pe-2]], had become available as well. The Soviet Air Force also fielded large numbers of aircraft supplied via lend-lease. Huge stockpiles of supplies and ample reserves of replacement aircraft meant the Red Army and VVS formations would be able to conduct an extended campaign without slackening in the intensity of their effort.{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=186}}\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{see also|Battle of Kursk order of battle}}\n\n=== Germans ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-219-0596-12, Russland, Panzer IV und Sch\u00fctzenpanzer in Fahrt.jpg|thumb|German Panzer IV and Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack]]\nFor the operation, the Germans used four armies along with a large portion of their total tank strength on the Eastern Front.

The Central and Voronezh Fronts fielded 12 armies, with 711,575 men (510,983 combat soldiers) and 625,591 men (446,236 combat soldiers) respectively. In reserve, the Steppe Front had an additional 573,195 men (449,133). Thus the total size of the Soviet force was 1,910,361 men, with 1,426,352 actual combat soldiers.\n\nSoviet armour strength included 4,869 tanks (including 205 [[KV-1]]s heavy tank) and 259 SPGs (including 25 [[SU-152]]s, 56 [[SU-122]]s and 67 [[SU-76]]s)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/wi2/foto/ww2/proh/page4.html |title = Strengths and Losses}}</ref> Overall a third of the Soviet tanks at Kursk were [[light tanks]], but in some units this proportion was considerably higher. Of the 3,600 tanks in the Central and Voronezh Fronts in July 1943, 1,061 were light as [[T-60]] and [[T-70]]. With very thin armour and small guns, they were unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of German medium and heavy tanks or [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter S.

Only the [[SU-122]] and [[SU-152]] self-propelled guns had the power to destroy the Tiger at short range, but they were not equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122s and SU-152s at Kursk.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Order of battle: Central Front (Army General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]){{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=478\u2013484}}\n|-\n!

The bombardment delayed the German formations, but failed in the goal of disrupting their schedule or inflicting substantial losses. The Germans began their own artillery bombardment at about 05:00, which lasted 80 minutes in the northern face and 50 minutes in the southern face.

The plan was for the 3rd SS Panzer Division to drive northeast until it reached the Karteschewka-Prokhorovka road. Once there, they were to strike southeast to attack the Soviet positions at Prokhorovka from the flanks and rear. The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer divisions were to wait until 3rd SS Panzer Division attack had destabilised the Soviet positions at Prokhorovka; and once underway, the 1st SS Panzer Division was to attack the main Soviet defences dug in on the slopes southwest of Prokhorovka. To the division's right, the 2nd SS Panzer Division was to advance eastward, then turn southward away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet lines opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap.{{sfn|Nipe|2011|p=310}} During the night of 11 July, Rotmistrov moved his [[5th Guards Tank Army]] to an assembly area just behind Prokhorovka in preparation for a massive attack the following day.{{sfn|Nipe|2011|p=309}}{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|p=77}} At 5:45 Leibstandarte \u200aheadquarters started receiving reports of the sound of tank engines as the Soviets moved into their assembly areas.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=363}} Soviet artillery and Katyusha regiments were redeployed in preparation for the counterattack.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=482}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-022-2924-14, Russland, Unternehmen \"Zitadelle\", Fahrzeuge.jpg|thumb|left|Vehicles of II SS-Panzer Corps advancing toward Prokhorovka on 11 July{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=308\u2013309}}]]\nAt around 08:00, a Soviet artillery barrage began.

Tasked with flanking the Soviet defences around Prokhorovka, the unit first had to beat off a number of attacks before they could go over onto the offensive. Most of the division's tank losses occurred late in the afternoon as they advanced through mine fields against well-hidden Soviet anti-tank guns. Although the 3rd SS succeeded in reaching the Karteschewka-Prokhorovka road, their hold was tenuous and it cost the division half of its armour. The majority of German tank losses suffered at Prokhorovka occurred here. To the south, the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps had been thrown back by the 1st SS Panzer Division. The 2nd SS Panzer Division also repelled attacks from the 2nd Tank Corps and the [[2nd Guards Tank Corps]].{{sfn|Nipe|2011|p=341}} Luftwaffe local air superiority over the battlefield also contributed to the Soviet losses, partly due to the VVS being directed against the German units on the flanks of II SS Panzer Corps.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007|pp=79\u201380}} By the end of the day, the Soviets had fallen back to their starting positions.{{sfn|Brand|2003}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-219-0553A-07, Russland, bei Pokrowka, ersch\u00f6pfte Soldaten.jpg|thumb|German soldiers pause during the fighting.]]\n\nNeither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives.

The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to stop the offensive and move forces from Kursk to Italy. Kluge welcomed the news, as he was aware that the Soviets were initiating a massive counter-offensive against his sector but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein's forces had just spent a week fighting through a maze of defensive works and he believed they were on the verge of breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, \"On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [has] committed [are] completely beaten\".{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=354}} Hitler agreed temporarily to allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient but the following day he ordered Manstein's reserve \u2013 the XXIV Panzer Corps \u2013 to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army.{{sfn|Healy|2010|p=355}}\n\nThe offensive continued in the southern part with the launch of [[Operation Roland]] on 14 July.

As the German momentum in the north slowed, the Soviets launched Operation Kutusov on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient, directly north of the Kursk salient. The [[Bryansk Front]], under the command of [[Markian Popov]], attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]], commanded by [[Vasily Sokolovsky]], attacked from the north. The Western Front's assault was led by the [[11th Guards Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Hovhannes Bagramyan]], and was supported by the 1st and 5th Tank Corps. The Soviet spearheads sustained heavy casualties, but pushed through and in some areas achieved significant penetrations.

For the first time, a major German offensive had been stopped before achieving a breakthrough. The Germans, despite using more technologically advanced armour than in previous years, were unable to break through the in-depth Soviet defences and were caught off guard by the significant operational reserves of the Red Army. This result changed the pattern of operations on the Eastern Front, with the Soviet Union gaining the operational initiative. The Soviet victory was costly, with the Red Army losing considerably more men and [[materiel]] than the German Army.

Citino]] used the term to comment on the failure of the operation: \"The operation misfired from the start. There was no strategic breakthrough\u2014no \"blitzkrieg\", no war of movement. Instead it turned into World War I with tanks\".({{harvnb|Citino|2013}}) In ''The Wehrmacht Retreats: Fighting a Lost War, 1943'' (2012), Citino did not use the term \"blitzkrieg\", instead describing Citadel as an attempted operation in the classical tradition of ''Bewegungskrieg'', (literally: \"war of movement\", or [[maneuver warfare]]), culminating in a ''Kesselschlacht'' (literally: \"cauldron battle\", or battle of encirclement)({{harvnb|Citino|2012}}.)\n}}\n{{efn\n|name=No Blitzkrieg\n|Historians Steven Newton ({{harvnb|Newton|2002}}) and Dieter Brand ({{harvnb|Brand|2003}}) make no mention of blitzkrieg in their characterization of the operation.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = Kharkov\n| \"With the final destruction of German forces at Kharkov, the Battle of Kursk came to an end.

(Alonzo Rodriguez, 16th century, Museo Regionale di [[Messina]]).]]\nThe '''kiss of peace''' is an ancient traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] [[greeting]], sometimes also called the \"holy kiss\", \"brother kiss\" (among men), or \"sister kiss\" (among women). Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that [[peace]] be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain [[ritualized]] or formalized uses long established in [[liturgy]]. Many denominations use other forms of greeting (besides literal [[kiss]]es) to serve equivalent purposes; they include [[handshake]]s, [[gesture]]s, and [[hug]]s, any of which may be called a '''sign of peace'''. \n\n==Sources==\nIt was the widespread custom in the ancient western [[Mediterranean]] for men to greet each other with a [[kiss]].<ref>William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988</ref> That was also the custom in ancient [[Judea]] and practiced also by Christians.\n\nHowever, the [[New Testament]]'s references to a [[Sacred|holy]] kiss ({{lang-gr|\u1f10\u03bd \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u03c9 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9}}, ''en hagio philemati'') and kiss of [[love]] (''\u1f10\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7\u03c2'') transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament:\n\n* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|16:16|NIV}} \u2014 \"Greet one another with a holy kiss\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u1ff3}}).\n* [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|16:20|NIV}} \u2014 \"Greet one another with a holy kiss\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u1ff3}}).\n* [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|13:12|NIV}} \u2014 \"Greet one another with a holy kiss\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u1ff3 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9}}).\n* [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Thessalonians|5:26|NIV}} \u2014 \"Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u1ff3}}).\n* [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Peter|5:14|NIV}} \u2014 \"Greet one another with a kiss of love\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7\u03c2}}).\n\nIt has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles. Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the [[Eucharist]] the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist.{{cn|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call \"a sign of peace\", which was already part of the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]], occurring after the [[Lord's Prayer]] in the [[Roman Rite]] and the rites directly derived from it. [[St. Augustine]], for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: {{Quotation|Then, after the consecration of the Holy Sacrifice of God, because He wished us also to be His sacrifice, a fact which was made clear when the Holy Sacrifice was first instituted, and because that Sacrifice is a sign of what we are,  behold,  when the Sacrifice is finished, we say the Lord's Prayer which  you have received and recited. After this, the 'Peace be with you\u2019 is said, and the Christians embrace one another with the holy kiss. This is a sign of peace; as the lips indicate, let  peace be made in your conscience, that is, when your lips  draw near to those of your brother, do not let your heart  withdraw from his. Hence, these are great and powerful sacraments.<ref>SERMON 227, ''The Fathers of the Church'',(1959), Roy Joseph Deferrari, Genera editor, ''Sermons on the Liturgical Seasons'', vol. 38, p. 197. [https://archive.org/details/fathersofthechur009512mbp] See also: Sermon 227 in ''The Works of Saint Augustine: A New Translation for the 21st Century'', (1993), Vol. 6, part, 3, p. 255. {{ISBN|1-56548-050-3}}</ref>}}\n\nAugustine's Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the \"kiss of peace\" as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, In his ''Paschale carmen'' (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, \"And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?\"<ref>For a documented discussion of the mouth-to-mouth early Christian kiss of peace, see Franco Mormando, \"Just as your lips approach the lips of yours brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal,\" in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed. F.

In the [[Gospels]], both greetings were used by [[Jesus]] - e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|24:36|NIV}}; [[John 20:21]], [[John 20:26]]. The Latin term translated as \"sign of peace\" is simply ''pax'' (\"peace\"), not ''signum pacis'' (\"sign of peace\") nor ''osculum pacis'' (\"kiss of peace\"). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, \"Let us offer each other the sign of peace\", is in Latin: ''Offerte vobis pacem'' (\"Offer each other peace\" or \"Offer each other the peace\").\n\nFrom an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men.<ref name=CathEncl />\n\n==In the Church==\nThe practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Episcopal Church,<ref>Book of Common Prayer, 1979; </ref> [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]]; some liturgical mainline [[Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]]; and [[Spiritual Christian]], where it is often called the '''kiss of peace''', '''sign of peace''', '''Holy kiss''' or simply '''peace''' or '''pax''';  It is practiced as a part of worship in many Anabaptist heritage groups including [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], and [[Apostolic Christian]].\n\n==Contemporary practices==\n\n=== Catholic Church ===\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], the term now used is not \"the kiss of peace\", but \"the sign of peace\" or \"the rite of peace\". The ''[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]]'' states: \"There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament.\"<ref>General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 82</ref> The priest says or sings: \"The peace of the Lord be with you always\", to which the people respond: \"And with your spirit.\" Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, \"if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: 'Let us offer each other the sign of peace.'\"<ref name=RM>Roman Missal, Order of Mass, 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], it is placed after the [[Pater Noster]] and before the [[Fractio panis (liturgy)|Fractio Panis]]. Even within the Catholic Church, there are [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]] (the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:23\u201324}} about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of [[Justin Martyr]] in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where [[Saint Augustine]] understood it as related to the petition, \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6e6LZrH1WXgC&pg=PA123&dq=Irwin+%22sign+of+peace%22+Augustine&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0kklVPP9LsiV7AbZwIGIAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Irwin%20%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20Augustine&f=false Kevin W.

If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words \"Pax tecum\" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the [[deacon]], who in turn gives it to the [[subdeacon]], who gives the sign to any other clergy present in [[choir dress]]. During the Nuptial Solemn Mass, it is also given to the groom, who then gives the sign of peace to his bride.\n\nIn the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that \"the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister\".<ref name=RM/> The manner prescribed is as follows: \"It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner.

The priest announces, \"Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--\" and the people conclude the sentence, \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided.\" At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries \"The doors! The doors!\"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: \"Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity.\"\n\nIn the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions.  Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests.  Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.\n\nAnother example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people \"Peace be with all\", and their reply: \"And with your Spirit\". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.\n\n=== Lutheranism ===\nThe [[Lutheran Church]] teach:<ref name=\"ELCA2013\">{{cite web |title=What is the \"Exchange of Peace?\" |url=https://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/What_is_the_Exchange_of_Peace.pdf |publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] |accessdate=2 April 2020 |language=English |date=2013}}</ref>\n{{quotation|The exchange of peace is a ministry, an announcement of grace we make to each other, a summary of the gift given to us in the liturgy of the Word.

Of course, the real motive behind those who want to do away with the holy kiss is not that the they are convinced that the Scriptures forbid the practice of greeting with a holy kiss, but that the kiss is not a socially acceptable or politically correct greeting. In other words, they find the holy kiss embarrassing; to practice it would force them to look conspicuous for the purpose of devotion to Christ and brotherly love--it is a price they are not willing to pay. So many arguments have been conjured up to enable many denominations to quickly rationalize the holy kiss away.\n\nAmazingly, this line of thinking has even found its way into some of our English Bibles! Specifically, authors of some paraphrased versions of the Bible have chosen to replace the words \"holy kiss\" in their versions of the Bible with the words \"handshake\" or \"hug\" (if you don't find the holy kiss in your Bible, that's why). It is a terrible thing that authors of these Bible versions found some words in the original Scriptures so offensive that they resorted to substituting \"less offensive\" words. It should make you wonder what else they have censored out of their \"Bibles\" for your \"benefit.\" Thankfully, the better translations like the KJV, NKJV, NASB and even the NIV stayed true to the Greek of the New Testament Scriptures (the New Testament was written in Greek).\n\nThe most common argument for not practicing the holy kiss is that the holy kiss was only a social custom at the time of the Apostles and since our modern culture no longer practices this custom, the Biblical directives regarding the holy kiss do not apply. And if one looks up \"holy kiss\" in the typical Christian encyclopedia, if it appears at all, you will probably find a mention of the Jewish practice of greeting with a kiss and the implication that this is an obsolete custom not to be practiced in modern times. But never will you find any substantial supporting evidence given for that position and for good reason: there isn't any! Let's look at three reasons why Christians should continue to practice the holy kiss.\nFirst: While we know that a kiss of greeting was practiced in Jewish cultures, it was most likely not practiced in the greater Roman Empire, in fact, there was an imperial edict against the practice! And let us not forget that all but one of the Biblical letters encouraging the practice of the holy kiss were written exclusively to churches outside of Jerusalem. Therefore, we know that Paul was encouraging these churches to do something which was contrary to their own culture and even against the law! Paul was very familiar with their culture because he lived in these areas for months and even years, so he knew of the raised eyebrows and hardship that the practice of the holy kiss might bring to those who practiced it.\n\nSo why would Paul instruct the early Gentile churches to practice the holy kiss at such great cost? It is very unlikely that Paul was trying to force a Jewish custom on those who lived outside of Judea and who were not Jewish. After all, let's not forget that Paul was the one who was trying to free the Gentiles from the Jewish customs of the Pharisees and from the Jewish Law, he would not want them encumbered with yet another Jewish custom!\n\nAnd we know that the holy kiss was most likely responsible for vicious rumors which led, in part, to the severe persecution and death of many early Christians. Yet even this did not cause the early Christians to abandon the practice of the holy kiss! If the holy kiss were only regarded as an old Jewish custom, wouldn't they have quit observing it? It is only reasonable to conclude that the holy kiss was not just a Jewish social custom, but something of much greater importance.\n\nSecond: We need to remember that the holy kiss is called holy. The word \"holy\" here comes from the Greek word \"hagios,\" literally meaning \"set apart\" from that which is common according to Strong's Concordance. This is the very same \"holy\" found in the \"Holy Spirit\" (or Holy Ghost) in the Bible. Does anyone believe that the Holy Spirit is just any old spirit? Let's hope not, for blaspheming the Holy Spirit is the one unforgivable sin! This is also the same \"holy\" found in \"Holy Father\"--meaning God (John 17:11) in Jesus's prayer on Mount Gethsemane just before His crucifixion. And this is the same \"holy\" as we shall appear before God if we remain true and faithful to Christ (Colossians 1:21-23).  This word appears over 200 times in the New Testament and not once is it used to define something common or less than holy.\n\nThe holy kiss is called just that to separate it from the ordinary, common kiss. It has special, godly, significance and that is why the Gentiles were instructed to practice the holy kiss, even when such kissing broke more than one cultural taboo! We should not take things the Bible calls \"holy\" lightly, they are called holy for a reason!\n\nThird: The fact that a kiss of greeting and a kiss of solidarity between those of the same religious group was practiced in Jewish culture in Biblical times does not make the holy kiss any less holy. Baptism was also a part of Jewish culture, Jews would regularly ceremonially bath in observance of the Law and also as an initiation into a religious group. Baptism was a practice that was much less common than kissing in the ancient world, yet few would suggest that we throw out the practice of baptism because of its cultural origins! We know that baptism has a special significance of its own for Christians.\n\nThere can be no doubt that communion has its origins in the Jewish observation of Passover. But obviously, Jesus changed the significance of this meal to something that the Jews of His time would not identify with. Yet we do not know of a single denomination that has thrown out communion because it has Jewish origins! The holy kiss is no different. We know that the greeting of the kiss was practiced between Jesus and His disciples. The Apostle Peter instructed both Gentile and Jewish churches alike to practice it. The churches practiced it because it had a special religious significance to them, it was no ordinary greeting, but a holy one.\n\nTo avoid the holy kiss because it is not politically-correct, or socially acceptable means that we place more importance on pleasing men than pleasing God. Jesus made it perfectly clear that we should not place the approval of man before the approval of God. And to assert that a handshake or hug may be substituted for the holy kiss is adding to the Word of God.|author=Apostolic Christian Church<ref name=\"ACC\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.apostolicchristianchurch.org/Pages/Beliefs,%2520The%2520Holy%2520Kiss.htm|title=Apostolic Christian Church Info Center, The Holy Kiss|website=www.apostolicchristianchurch.org|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Pax (liturgy)]]\n* [[Pax (liturgical object)]], an object formerly kissed as a substitute during Catholic masses\n* [[Socialist fraternal kiss]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/K52578.html Kiss, Holy] in ''Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online''\n* [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm Kiss] \u2013 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]\n{{CatholicMass|collapsed}}\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Greetings]]\n[[Category:Christian symbols]]\n[[Category:Peace]]\n[[Category:Mass (liturgy)]]\n[[Category:Biblical phrases]]\n[[Category:Anabaptism]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Kissing|Peace]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Alonzo_Rodriguez_Commiato_dei_santi_Pietro_e_Paolo_Messina_Museo_Regionale.jpg|thumb|''Farewell of [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]]'', showing the [[Apostles]] giving each other the holy kiss before their [[martyr]]dom.

Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that [[peace]] be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain [[ritualized]] or formalized uses long established in [[liturgy]].

Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the [[Eucharist]] the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist.{{cn|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call \"a sign of peace\", which was already part of the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]], occurring after the [[Lord's Prayer]] in the [[Roman Rite]] and the rites directly derived from it. [[St. Augustine]], for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: {{Quotation|Then, after the consecration of the Holy Sacrifice of God, because He wished us also to be His sacrifice, a fact which was made clear when the Holy Sacrifice was first instituted, and because that Sacrifice is a sign of what we are,  behold,  when the Sacrifice is finished, we say the Lord's Prayer which  you have received and recited. After this, the 'Peace be with you\u2019 is said, and the Christians embrace one another with the holy kiss. This is a sign of peace; as the lips indicate, let  peace be made in your conscience, that is, when your lips  draw near to those of your brother, do not let your heart  withdraw from his. Hence, these are great and powerful sacraments.<ref>SERMON 227, ''The Fathers of the Church'',(1959), Roy Joseph Deferrari, Genera editor, ''Sermons on the Liturgical Seasons'', vol. 38, p. 197.

For example, In his ''Paschale carmen'' (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, \"And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?\"<ref>For a documented discussion of the mouth-to-mouth early Christian kiss of peace, see Franco Mormando, \"Just as your lips approach the lips of yours brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal,\" in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed.

Even within the Catholic Church, there are [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]] (the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:23\u201324}} about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of [[Justin Martyr]] in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where [[Saint Augustine]] understood it as related to the petition, \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6e6LZrH1WXgC&pg=PA123&dq=Irwin+%22sign+of+peace%22+Augustine&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0kklVPP9LsiV7AbZwIGIAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Irwin%20%22sign%20of%20peace%22%20Augustine&f=false Kevin W.

If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words \"Pax tecum\" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the [[deacon]], who in turn gives it to the [[subdeacon]], who gives the sign to any other clergy present in [[choir dress]]. During the Nuptial Solemn Mass, it is also given to the groom, who then gives the sign of peace to his bride.\n\nIn the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that \"the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister\".<ref name=RM/> The manner prescribed is as follows: \"It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful.\"<ref name=VD>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html Redemptionis Sacramentum], 72</ref>\n\nThe following are considered abuses by the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]]:<ref name=XD>[https://zenit.org/articles/text-of-vatican-document-on-sign-of-peace-at-mass/ Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments.

In some countries, such as the [[United States]], the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as [[India]] and [[Thailand]], a bow is prescribed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S31TA-yPDGwC&pg=PT85&dq=%22sign+of+peace%22+handshake+bow&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SWglVKyKDoHN7QbhxoHABA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22sign+of+peace%22+handshake+bow&f=false|title=Liturgical Question Box: Answers to Common Questions about the Modern Liturgy|first=Peter J.|last=Elliott|date=January 1, 1998|publisher=Ignatius Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than \"familiar and profane gestures of greeting\".<ref name=VD/>\n\n=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, \"Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--\" and the people conclude the sentence, \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided.\" At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries \"The doors! The doors!\"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: \"Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity.\"\n\nIn the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions.  Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests.  Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.\n\nAnother example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people \"Peace be with all\", and their reply: \"And with your Spirit\". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.\n\n=== Lutheranism ===\nThe [[Lutheran Church]] teach:<ref name=\"ELCA2013\">{{cite web |title=What is the \"Exchange of Peace?\" |url=https://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/What_is_the_Exchange_of_Peace.pdf |publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] |accessdate=2 April 2020 |language=English |date=2013}}</ref>\n{{quotation|The exchange of peace is a ministry, an announcement of grace we make to each other, a summary of the gift given to us in the liturgy of the Word.

Of course, the real motive behind those who want to do away with the holy kiss is not that the they are convinced that the Scriptures forbid the practice of greeting with a holy kiss, but that the kiss is not a socially acceptable or politically correct greeting. In other words, they find the holy kiss embarrassing; to practice it would force them to look conspicuous for the purpose of devotion to Christ and brotherly love--it is a price they are not willing to pay. So many arguments have been conjured up to enable many denominations to quickly rationalize the holy kiss away.\n\nAmazingly, this line of thinking has even found its way into some of our English Bibles! Specifically, authors of some paraphrased versions of the Bible have chosen to replace the words \"holy kiss\" in their versions of the Bible with the words \"handshake\" or \"hug\" (if you don't find the holy kiss in your Bible, that's why). It is a terrible thing that authors of these Bible versions found some words in the original Scriptures so offensive that they resorted to substituting \"less offensive\" words. It should make you wonder what else they have censored out of their \"Bibles\" for your \"benefit.\" Thankfully, the better translations like the KJV, NKJV, NASB and even the NIV stayed true to the Greek of the New Testament Scriptures (the New Testament was written in Greek).\n\nThe most common argument for not practicing the holy kiss is that the holy kiss was only a social custom at the time of the Apostles and since our modern culture no longer practices this custom, the Biblical directives regarding the holy kiss do not apply. And if one looks up \"holy kiss\" in the typical Christian encyclopedia, if it appears at all, you will probably find a mention of the Jewish practice of greeting with a kiss and the implication that this is an obsolete custom not to be practiced in modern times. But never will you find any substantial supporting evidence given for that position and for good reason: there isn't any! Let's look at three reasons why Christians should continue to practice the holy kiss.\nFirst: While we know that a kiss of greeting was practiced in Jewish cultures, it was most likely not practiced in the greater Roman Empire, in fact, there was an imperial edict against the practice! And let us not forget that all but one of the Biblical letters encouraging the practice of the holy kiss were written exclusively to churches outside of Jerusalem. Therefore, we know that Paul was encouraging these churches to do something which was contrary to their own culture and even against the law! Paul was very familiar with their culture because he lived in these areas for months and even years, so he knew of the raised eyebrows and hardship that the practice of the holy kiss might bring to those who practiced it.\n\nSo why would Paul instruct the early Gentile churches to practice the holy kiss at such great cost? It is very unlikely that Paul was trying to force a Jewish custom on those who lived outside of Judea and who were not Jewish. After all, let's not forget that Paul was the one who was trying to free the Gentiles from the Jewish customs of the Pharisees and from the Jewish Law, he would not want them encumbered with yet another Jewish custom!\n\nAnd we know that the holy kiss was most likely responsible for vicious rumors which led, in part, to the severe persecution and death of many early Christians. Yet even this did not cause the early Christians to abandon the practice of the holy kiss! If the holy kiss were only regarded as an old Jewish custom, wouldn't they have quit observing it? It is only reasonable to conclude that the holy kiss was not just a Jewish social custom, but something of much greater importance.\n\nSecond: We need to remember that the holy kiss is called holy. The word \"holy\" here comes from the Greek word \"hagios,\" literally meaning \"set apart\" from that which is common according to Strong's Concordance. This is the very same \"holy\" found in the \"Holy Spirit\" (or Holy Ghost) in the Bible. Does anyone believe that the Holy Spirit is just any old spirit? Let's hope not, for blaspheming the Holy Spirit is the one unforgivable sin! This is also the same \"holy\" found in \"Holy Father\"--meaning God (John 17:11) in Jesus's prayer on Mount Gethsemane just before His crucifixion. And this is the same \"holy\" as we shall appear before God if we remain true and faithful to Christ (Colossians 1:21-23).  This word appears over 200 times in the New Testament and not once is it used to define something common or less than holy.\n\nThe holy kiss is called just that to separate it from the ordinary, common kiss. It has special, godly, significance and that is why the Gentiles were instructed to practice the holy kiss, even when such kissing broke more than one cultural taboo! We should not take things the Bible calls \"holy\" lightly, they are called holy for a reason!\n\nThird: The fact that a kiss of greeting and a kiss of solidarity between those of the same religious group was practiced in Jewish culture in Biblical times does not make the holy kiss any less holy. Baptism was also a part of Jewish culture, Jews would regularly ceremonially bath in observance of the Law and also as an initiation into a religious group. Baptism was a practice that was much less common than kissing in the ancient world, yet few would suggest that we throw out the practice of baptism because of its cultural origins! We know that baptism has a special significance of its own for Christians.\n\nThere can be no doubt that communion has its origins in the Jewish observation of Passover. But obviously, Jesus changed the significance of this meal to something that the Jews of His time would not identify with. Yet we do not know of a single denomination that has thrown out communion because it has Jewish origins! The holy kiss is no different. We know that the greeting of the kiss was practiced between Jesus and His disciples. The Apostle Peter instructed both Gentile and Jewish churches alike to practice it. The churches practiced it because it had a special religious significance to them, it was no ordinary greeting, but a holy one.\n\nTo avoid the holy kiss because it is not politically-correct, or socially acceptable means that we place more importance on pleasing men than pleasing God. Jesus made it perfectly clear that we should not place the approval of man before the approval of God. And to assert that a handshake or hug may be substituted for the holy kiss is adding to the Word of God.|author=Apostolic Christian Church<ref name=\"ACC\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.apostolicchristianchurch.org/Pages/Beliefs,%2520The%2520Holy%2520Kiss.htm|title=Apostolic Christian Church Info Center, The Holy Kiss|website=www.apostolicchristianchurch.org|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Pax (liturgy)]]\n* [[Pax (liturgical object)]], an object formerly kissed as a substitute during Catholic masses\n* [[Socialist fraternal kiss]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/K52578.html Kiss, Holy] in ''Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online''\n* [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08663a.htm Kiss] \u2013 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]\n{{CatholicMass|collapsed}}\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Greetings]]\n[[Category:Christian symbols]]\n[[Category:Peace]]\n[[Category:Mass (liturgy)]]\n[[Category:Biblical phrases]]\n[[Category:Anabaptism]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Kissing|Peace]]\n", "name_user": "Benlugosch", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:Corrected a few diacriticals in the Greek", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_of_peace"}
