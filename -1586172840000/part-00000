The annexation was recognised by few nations (including Australia and the United States) and was resisted by many East Timorese. [[Cold War]] security concerns were emphasised,{{sfn|Gunderson|2015|p=15}} while foreign powers also placed high importance on good relations with Indonesia and were largely reluctant to assist a push for independence as a result. However, following [[Fall of Suharto|the fall of long-serving Indonesian President Suharto]], the new president, [[B. J. Habibie]], was prepared to grant East Timor special autonomy.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\">{{cite web|url=\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/content/s2422684.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923201217/http://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/content/s2422684.htm|title=The Howard Years: Episode 2: \"Whatever It Takes\"|work=Program Transcript|date=24 November 2008|archivedate=23 September 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1998, the Australian prime minister, [[John Howard]], with his foreign minister, [[Alexander Downer]], drafted a letter to Habibie supporting the idea of autonomy but incorporating a suggestion that the long-term issue of East Timorese self-determination could best be defused by providing the East Timorese with an opportunity for a [[plebiscite]] after a substantial period of autonomy. The explicit comparison was with the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Accords]] involving France and [[New Caledonia]].{{sfn|Connery|2010|pp=147\u2013148}} The letter upset Habibie, who saw it as implying Indonesia was a \"[[colonial power]]\", and he decided in response to announce a [[snap election|snap referendum]] to be conducted within six months.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nNews of the proposal provoked a violent reaction from pro-Indonesian militia in East Timor. The Indonesian army did not intervene to restore order. At a summit in [[Bali]], Howard told Habibie that a United Nations peacekeeping force should oversee the process. Habibie rejected the proposal, believing it would have insulted the Indonesian military.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\n==East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum==\n{{See also|East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum}}\n\nThe [[United Nations Mission in East Timor]] (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct a referendum on the question of independence. It was composed of police and observers rather than military personnel. The UN-sponsored [[referendum]] held on 30 August 1999 showed overwhelming approval for East Timorese [[independence]] from [[Indonesia]]. After the result was announced on 4 September, violent clashes, instigated by a suspected anti-independence [[militia]], sparked a humanitarian and security crisis in the region, with [[Xanana Gusm\u00e3o]] calling for a UN peacekeeping force the same day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/438145.stm|title=Timor chooses independence|work=BBC News|date=4 September 1999}}</ref> Many East Timorese were killed, with as many as 500,000 displaced and around half fleeing the territory.<ref name=\"awm.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/peacekeeping.asp|title=Australians and Peacekeeping|work=War History|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 September, Operation Spitfire commenced with [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[C-130 Hercules]] aircraft evacuating UNAMET staff, foreign nationals and refugees, including [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo|Bishop Belo]], to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] from Dili and [[Baucau]] airfields with protection provided by unarmed [[Special Air Service Regiment]] (SASR) soldiers.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=483\u2013489}}\n\n==United Nations resolution==\nThe violence was met with widespread public anger in Australia, Portugal and elsewhere, and activists in Portugal, Australia, the United States and other nations pressured their governments to take action.

Soon after, the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET) was established as a peacekeeping operation which was also fully responsible for the administration of East Timor to oversee its transition to independence.<ref name=\"awm.gov.au\"/> With only limited forces available, Cosgrove adopted the 'oil spot' concept of dominating key areas from which the surrounding areas could be influenced and then secured, moving quickly by helicopter to keep the militia off balance. The large airfield at [[Baucau]] was secured by two platoons from 2 RAR on 22 September, who were relieved by the [[Philippine Army]] non-combat contingent known as the Philippine Humanitarian Support Mission to East Timor (PhilHSMET) three days later.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=28}}\n\nOn 26 September D Company, 2 RAR conducted an air-mobile insertion into [[Liquica]], approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} returning to Dili about 30 hours later.{{sfn|Farrell|2000|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=28}} On 29 September, the first New Zealand infantry arrived in Dili with V Company from the 1st Battalion, [[Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment]] (1 RNZIR) together with four M-113 APCs from the [[Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles]].

The same day a platoon from 2 RAR was fired on by Indonesian police near [[Mota'ain]] on the border, and in the ensuing clash one Indonesian was killed.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=28}}\n\nOn 13 October, a major amphibious operation was launched at Suai with the bulk of Headquarters 3rd Brigade (renamed Headquarters West Force) logistic and support units landed.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=29}} West Force (WESTFOR) consisting of 2RAR, 3RAR, and 1RNZIR, in addition to supporting aviation, engineer and armoured units, was tasked with securing the border region.{{sfn|Farrell|2000|p=55}} By 22 October, the 1 RNZIR Battalion Group was fully deployed which included a Canadian infantry company from [[Royal 22nd Regiment|3rd Battalion, Royal 22 Regiment]] and a platoon of Irish special forces from the [[Army Ranger Wing]] supported by [[No. 3 Squadron RNZAF]] Iroquois helicopters.{{sfn|Farrell|2000|p=57}} From mid-October contingents from a number of other countries began to arrive, including battalions from Thailand and South Korea, which were deployed in the eastern part of the country.{{sfn|Farrell|2000|p=57}}\n\nThe arrival of thousands of international troops in East Timor caused the militia to flee across the border into Indonesia. A [[Battle of Aidabasalala|major contact at Aidabasalala]], {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the West Timor border, occurred on 16 October 1999. The action, involving an Australian covert reconnaissance patrol from the SASR, saw the Australians repeatedly attacked in a series of fire-fights by a group of more than 20 militia. The SASR patrol had been detected whilst establishing an observation post and were forced to fight their way to a landing zone, being attacked a further three times over a one-and-a-half hour period, killing a number of their attackers before they were successfully extracted by Black Hawk helicopter. Five militia were killed and three wounded, whilst there were no Australian casualties.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=296}} Later, intelligence reports speculated on the involvement of [[Indonesian military]] personnel in the attempt to cut off and destroy the Australians, whilst conjecture as to the identity of the pro-Indonesian militias and the source of their arms and training increased in the media.{{sfn|Farrell|2000|pp=56\u201357}}{{#tag:ref|Sporadic cross-border raids by the militia in 2000 following the hand-over to UNTAET led to further suspicion that the militia had the tacit support of elements of the Indonesian military, or that at the least their actions were being tolerated by them.{{sfn|Tanter|Selden|Shalom|2001|pp=249\u2013250}} Heightened activity occurred between July and September 2000, particularly in the southern border held by the [[New Zealand Army]], which resulted in the death of one New Zealand soldier and one from Nepal, as well as the wounding of three others.

1999\u20132000 until the arrival of [[UN peacekeepers]].<ref name=\"awm.gov.au\"/> INTERFET was commanded by an Australian [[military officer]], [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Peter

The annexation was recognised by few nations (including Australia and the United States) and was resisted by many East Timorese. [[Cold War]] security concerns were emphasised,{{sfn|Gunderson|2015|p=15}} while foreign powers also placed high importance on good relations with Indonesia and were largely reluctant to assist a push for independence as a result. However, following [[Fall of Suharto|the fall of long-serving Indonesian President Suharto]], the new president, [[B. J. Habibie]], was prepared to grant East Timor special autonomy.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\">{{cite web|url=\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/content/s2422684.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923201217/http://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/content/s2422684.htm|title=The Howard Years: Episode 2: \"Whatever It Takes\"|work=Program Transcript|date=24 November 2008|archivedate=23 September 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1998, the Australian prime minister, [[John Howard]], with his foreign minister, [[Alexander Downer]], drafted a letter to Habibie supporting the idea of autonomy but incorporating a suggestion that the long-term issue of East Timorese self-determination could best be defused by providing the East Timorese with an opportunity for a [[plebiscite]] after a substantial period of autonomy.
