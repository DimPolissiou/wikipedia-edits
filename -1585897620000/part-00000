Many fires are as a result of either deliberate arson or carelessness, however these fires normally happen in readily accessible areas and are rapidly brought under control.  Man-made events include [[electric arc|arcing]] from overhead power lines, arson, accidental ignition in the course of agricultural clearing, grinding and welding activities, campfires, cigarettes and dropped matches, sparks from machinery, and [[controlled burn]] escapes. They spread based on the type and quantity of fuel that is available. Fuel can include everything from trees, underbrush and dry grassy fields to homes. Wind supplies the fire with additional oxygen pushing the fire across the land at a faster rate.\n\nLarge, violent wildfires can generate winds of their own, called fire whirls. Fire whirls are like tornadoes and result from the vortices created by the fire's heat. When these vortices are tilted from horizontal to vertical, this creates fire whirls. These whirls have been known to hurl flaming logs and burning debris over considerable distances.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bonsor, Kevin|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/wildfire1.htm|title=How Wildfires Work|work=How Stuff Works|date=29 May 2001|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome reports indicate that a changing climate could also be contributing to the ferocity of the 2019\u201320 fires with hotter, drier conditions making the country's fire season longer and much more dangerous.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/australia-burning-bushfires-bad/|title=Australia is burning \u2013 but why are the bushfires so bad and is climate change to blame?|first=Sarah|last=Newey|date=2 January 2020|work=The Telegraph|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> Strong winds also promote the rapid spread of fires by lifting burning embers into the air.

The nature of the fire depends somewhat on local [[topography]]. Hilly/mountainous fires burn in areas which are usually densely forested. The land is less accessible and not conducive to agriculture, thus many of these densely forested areas have been saved from [[deforestation]] and are protected by national, state and other parks. The steep terrain increases the speed and intensity of a firestorm. Where settlements are located in hilly or mountainous areas, bushfires can pose a threat to both life and property. Flat/grassland fires burn along flat plains or areas of small undulation, predominantly covered in grasses or scrubland. These fires can move quickly, fanned by high winds in flat topography, and they quickly consume the small amounts of fuel/vegetation available. These fires pose less of a threat to settlements as they rarely reach the same intensity seen in major firestorms as the land is flat, the fires are easier to map and predict, and the terrain is more accessible for [[firefighting]] personnel. Many regions of predominantly flat terrain in Australia have been almost completely deforested for agriculture, reducing the fuel loads which would otherwise facilitate fires in these areas.\n\n=== Climate change ===\n{{See also| Climate change in Australia}}\nAustralia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts.<ref name=\"ScientificAmerican\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/australias-angry-summer-this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like/|title=Australia's Angry Summer: This Is What Climate Change Looks Like|author=Abram, Nerilie|author-link=Nerilie Abram|date=31 December 2019|work=Scientific American|accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref> Eight of Australia's ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005.<ref name=stuff>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/118568474/australia-bushfires-spew-twothirds-of-national-carbon-emissions-in-one-season|title=Australia bushfires spew two-thirds of national carbon emissions in one season|work=Stuff|location=New Zealand|date=3 January 2019|accessdate=}}</ref> A study in 2018 conducted at Melbourne University found that the major droughts of the late 20th century and early 21st century in southern Australia are \"likely without precedent over the past 400 years\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=Freund, Mandy|author2=Henley, Ben|author3=Allen, Kathryn|author4=Baker, Patrick|url=https://theconversation.com/recent-australian-droughts-may-be-the-worst-in-800-years-94292|title=Recent Australian droughts may be the worst in 800 years|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|author= |date=2 May 2018|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> Across the country, the average summer temperatures have increased leading to record-breaking hot weather,<ref name=\"auto\"/> with the early summer of 2019 the hottest on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/Climate%20of%20the%20Nation%202019%20%5BWEB%5D.pdf|title=Climate of the Nation|year=2019|publisher=The Australia Institute|page=3|issn=|accessdate=}}</ref> 2019 was also Australia's driest ever year since 1900 with rainfall 40% lower than average.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite news|author=Readfearn, Graham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/explainer-what-are-the-underlying-causes-of-australias-shocking-bushfire-season|title=Explainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?|work=Guardian Australia|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHeatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create conditions that increase the risk of bushfires.

In extreme fires, koalas tend to climb up to the top of a tree and curl into a ball where they become trapped. In January 2020 it was reported that half of the 50,000 koalas on [[Kangaroo Island]] off Australia's southern coast, which are kept separate to those on the mainland as insurance for the species\u2019 future, are thought to have died in the previous few weeks.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/kangaroo-koala-australia-bushfires-wildfires-die|title=The world loves kangaroos and koalas.

Loss of habitat also affects already endangered species such as the western ground parrot, the Leadbeater's possum, the Mallee emu-wren (a bird which cannot fly very far), and Gilbert's potoroo. Beekeepers have also lost hives in bushfires.<ref name=\"BBC_22Nov2019\"/>\n\nKangaroos and wallabies can move quickly trying to escape from fires. However, the Guardian reported in January 2020 that dozens, maybe hundreds of kangaroos \"perished in their droves\" as they tried to outrun the flames near Batlow in NSW.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The most resilient animals are those that can burrow or fly. Possums often get singed, but can sometimes hide in tree hollows. Wombats and snakes tend to go underground.<ref name=BBC_22Nov2019/>\n\n[[Goanna]]s can benefit from bushfires. Dickman says: \"In central Australia, we've seen goannas coming out from their burrows after a fire and picking off injured animals \u2013 singed birds, young birds, small mammals, surface-dwelling lizards, and snakes.\"<ref name=BBC_22Nov2019/>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nIn South Australia, Kangaroo Island was devastated when 25,000 Koalas were killed.

Tens of thousands of farm animals, mostly sheep, were also killed in the fire on Kangaroo Island. There are concerns about the survival of endangered species on Kangaroo Island, which include the dunnart (a mouse-like marsupial) and the black glossy cockatoo.\n\n== Impact on humans ==\n\nThe most devastating impact on humans is that bushfires have killed over 800 people since 1851.<ref name=Tronson/> In addition to loss of life, homes, properties, and livestock are destroyed potentially leaving people homeless, traumatised, and without access to electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, to drinking water.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-bushfires-insurance/australia-strengthens-bushfire-defenses-as-economic-environmental-costs-mount-idUSKBN1Z601F Australia strengthens bushfire defenses as economic, environmental costs mount], Reuters, 7 January 2020</ref>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nAt least 33 people have been killed, 4 of which were firefighters. About 2,000 homes have been destroyed, which has forced thousands to seek shelter elsewhere. Two people have also died on Kangaroo Island in South Australia.

Many fires are as a result of either deliberate arson or carelessness, however these fires normally happen in readily accessible areas and are rapidly brought under control.  Man-made events include [[electric arc|arcing]] from overhead power lines, arson, accidental ignition in the course of agricultural clearing, grinding and welding activities, campfires, cigarettes and dropped matches, sparks from machinery, and [[controlled burn]] escapes. They spread based on the type and quantity of fuel that is available. Fuel can include everything from trees, underbrush and dry grassy fields to homes. Wind supplies the fire with additional oxygen pushing the fire across the land at a faster rate.\n\nLarge, violent wildfires can generate winds of their own, called fire whirls. Fire whirls are like tornadoes and result from the vortices created by the fire's heat. When these vortices are tilted from horizontal to vertical, this creates fire whirls. These whirls have been known to hurl flaming logs and burning debris over considerable distances.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bonsor, Kevin|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/wildfire1.htm|title=How Wildfires Work|work=How Stuff Works|date=29 May 2001|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome reports indicate that a changing climate could also be contributing to the ferocity of the 2019\u201320 fires with hotter, drier conditions making the country's fire season longer and much more dangerous.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/australia-burning-bushfires-bad/|title=Australia is burning \u2013 but why are the bushfires so bad and is climate change to blame?|first=Sarah|last=Newey|date=2 January 2020|work=The Telegraph|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> Strong winds also promote the rapid spread of fires by lifting burning embers into the air.

The nature of the fire depends somewhat on local [[topography]]. Hilly/mountainous fires burn in areas which are usually densely forested. The land is less accessible and not conducive to agriculture, thus many of these densely forested areas have been saved from [[deforestation]] and are protected by national, state and other parks. The steep terrain increases the speed and intensity of a firestorm. Where settlements are located in hilly or mountainous areas, bushfires can pose a threat to both life and property. Flat/grassland fires burn along flat plains or areas of small undulation, predominantly covered in grasses or scrubland. These fires can move quickly, fanned by high winds in flat topography, and they quickly consume the small amounts of fuel/vegetation available. These fires pose less of a threat to settlements as they rarely reach the same intensity seen in major firestorms as the land is flat, the fires are easier to map and predict, and the terrain is more accessible for [[firefighting]] personnel. Many regions of predominantly flat terrain in Australia have been almost completely deforested for agriculture, reducing the fuel loads which would otherwise facilitate fires in these areas.\n\n=== Climate change ===\n{{See also| Climate change in Australia}}\nAustralia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts.<ref name=\"ScientificAmerican\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/australias-angry-summer-this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like/|title=Australia's Angry Summer: This Is What Climate Change Looks Like|author=Abram, Nerilie|author-link=Nerilie Abram|date=31 December 2019|work=Scientific American|accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref> Eight of Australia's ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005.<ref name=stuff>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/118568474/australia-bushfires-spew-twothirds-of-national-carbon-emissions-in-one-season|title=Australia bushfires spew two-thirds of national carbon emissions in one season|work=Stuff|location=New Zealand|date=3 January 2019|accessdate=}}</ref> A study in 2018 conducted at Melbourne University found that the major droughts of the late 20th century and early 21st century in southern Australia are \"likely without precedent over the past 400 years\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=Freund, Mandy|author2=Henley, Ben|author3=Allen, Kathryn|author4=Baker, Patrick|url=https://theconversation.com/recent-australian-droughts-may-be-the-worst-in-800-years-94292|title=Recent Australian droughts may be the worst in 800 years|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|author= |date=2 May 2018|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> Across the country, the average summer temperatures have increased leading to record-breaking hot weather,<ref name=\"auto\"/> with the early summer of 2019 the hottest on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/Climate%20of%20the%20Nation%202019%20%5BWEB%5D.pdf|title=Climate of the Nation|year=2019|publisher=The Australia Institute|page=3|issn=|accessdate=}}</ref> 2019 was also Australia's driest ever year since 1900 with rainfall 40% lower than average.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite news|author=Readfearn, Graham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/explainer-what-are-the-underlying-causes-of-australias-shocking-bushfire-season|title=Explainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?|work=Guardian Australia|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHeatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create conditions that increase the risk of bushfires.

There are concerns about the survival of endangered species on Kangaroo Island, which include the dunnart (a mouse-like marsupial) and the black glossy cockatoo.\n\n== Impact on humans ==\n\nThe most devastating impact on humans is that bushfires have killed over 800 people since 1851.<ref name=Tronson/> In addition to loss of life, homes, properties, and livestock are destroyed potentially leaving people homeless, traumatised, and without access to electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, to drinking water.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-bushfires-insurance/australia-strengthens-bushfire-defenses-as-economic-environmental-costs-mount-idUSKBN1Z601F Australia strengthens bushfire defenses as economic, environmental costs mount], Reuters, 7 January 2020</ref>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nAt least 33 people have been killed, 4 of which were firefighters. About 2,000 homes have been destroyed, which has forced thousands to seek shelter elsewhere. Two people have also died on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. More than 80 homes were destroyed in South Australia near Adelaide Hills, as well as one-third of the vineyards that provide grapes for the wine industry.\n\n=== Health ===\nBushfires produce particulate-matter pollution \u2013 airborne particles that are small enough to enter and damage human lung tissue. Following the [[Hazelwood Power Station#Coal mine fire|Hazelwood fire]] in 2014, Fay Johnston, an associate professor of public health at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research, says young children exposed to smoke either as infants, toddlers or in the womb develop changes to their lung function.
