Ashley announced his resignation from the priesthood - so he could marry - to the shock of the Bishop. Ashley later withdraws his resignation, causing George to once again say that Ashley is quick to make decisions. Eventually, the Bishop gives his approval and marries the couple in November 2005. Among the ceremonies he has conducted include the marriage of [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] ([[Kenneth Farrington]]) and [[Rosemary King|Rosemary Sinclair]] ([[Linda Thorson]]) on Christmas Day 2006 and the baptism of the Hope twins in May 2007.

While Emily and George spend more time with each other, he is persuading her to become a priest. In October 2008, Bishop George announces that Emmerdale's village church, St. Mary's, is to close due to low attendance at services. The congregation, organised by [[Nicola King|Nicola De Souza]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]), start a village choir and enter a competition, where they win an effort award. However, the church is still to be sold to [[Eric Pollard]] ([[Chris Chittell]]) and the last service will be on Christmas Day 2008. However, on Christmas Day, Nicola organises a sit-in at the Church and invites all the press including ''[[Calendar (News)|Calendar]]''. This causes Eric to pull out of buying the site, and the Bishop tells Ashley the following day that he may continue services in the church until a new buyer is found. He returns in January to tell the Thomas' that the church has been bought and they must be prepared to leave. However, the following day the church's new owners, [[Mark Wylde|Mark]] ([[Maxwell Caulfield]]) and [[Natasha Wylde]] ([[Amanda Donohoe]]), give the church back to the community and Ashley keeps his job. In February 2009, he visits the village when Ashley and Laurel have to tell him that [[Jasmine Thomas]] ([[Jenna Coleman|Jenna-Louise Coleman]]) has run away after murdering someone while Laurel is being charged with perverting the course of justice. He appears frequently appears during [[Sally Spode]]'s ([[Si\u00e2n Reeves]]) time in the village. Her husband was a vicar who he thought was abusing her so sent him to a health retreat.

First appearing in 2000, Faith returns to Emmerdale in October 2004 for celebrations to mark Zak and his family's 10th anniversary in the village. She tries to get to know her granddaughter, Debbie, but Cain does not let her.\n\nFaith and Shadrach's marriage was not a happy one, including many affairs and violence on both sides. Faith left her family when her children were young and did not see them again until they were in their twenties.\n\nIn February 2017, Faith is found hiding in the barn at Wishing Well Cottage and meets her great-granddaughter, Sarah, who has no idea who she is. She asks Sarah to keep her presence secret and to supply her with things. When Debbie becomes suspicious of Sarah's behaviour, Sarah takes her to meet Faith, only to find Faith has gone. At the B&B, Faith collapses in the bathroom and is found by [[Douglas Potts|Doug Potts]] ([[Duncan Preston]]), who calls an ambulance. When Faith is taken outside, she sees Cain and Chas, who are not pleased to see her. While in hospital it emerges that she is Sarah's benefactor, having made herself penniless by donating \u00a320,000 for Sarah's cancer treatment. Faith is horrified when she discovers that Aaron was raped by his father when he was young and told him that he did the right thing to change his name to Dingle. At Aaron's wedding to [[Robert Sugden]] ([[Ryan Hawley]]), a woman arrives with the police and tells them that Faith murdered her father.\n\nFaith later hosts a psychic night at The Woolpack, panicking [[Emma Barton (Emmerdale)|Emma Barton]] ([[Gillian Kearney]]) who killed her husband [[James Barton (Emmerdale)|James]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) the previous year. Faith makes out as though she knows this after overhearing Emma confessing in church, however Emma realises that Faith cannot know the truth when Faith believes that James committed suicide. After an emotional heart-to-heart with Chas, Faith rejects a hug from her, leaving Chas furious and heartbroken. It is later revealed that Faith has had a [[double mastectomy]] after battling [[breast cancer]].\n\nIn October 2018 it was revealed that Faith was the one to push [[Kim Tate]] ([[Claire King]]) down the stairs and into a Champagne Fountain after Kim bad mouthed the whole Dingle Clan. Faith was one of three suspects but was later confirmed to be the culprit after [[Charity Dingle]] confronted her after she accused her son [[Noah Tate]] of committing the crime.\n\nLaura-Jayne Tyler of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' praised Faith's reintroduction, describing Faith as \"a wonderfully wicked addition\" and \"fun, frivolours and feisty\".

The harbour is an inlet of the [[Tasman Sea]] (part of the [[South Pacific Ocean]]). It is the location of the [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. The location of the [[History of Australia|first European settlement and colony]] on the Australian mainland, Port Jackson has continued to play a key role in the history and development of Sydney.\n\nPort Jackson, in the early days of the colony, was also used as a shorthand for Sydney and its environs. Thus, many botanists, see, e.g, [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]'s  ''Prodromus flor\u00e6 Nov\u00e6 Hollandi\u00e6 et Insul\u00e6 Van-Diemen,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/111968|title=Prodromus flor\u00e6 Nov\u00e6 Hollandi\u00e6 et Insul\u00e6 Van-Diemen : exhibens characteres plantarum quas annis 1802-1805 /|last=Brown|first=Robert|publisher=typis R. Taylor et socii|location=Londini}}</ref>'' described their specimens as having been collected at Port Jackson.\n\nMany recreational events are based on or around the harbour itself particularly the [[Sydney New Year's Eve]] celebrations and the starting point of the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].\n\nThe waterways of Port Jackson are managed by the [[Roads & Maritime Services]]. [[Sydney Harbour National Park]] protects a number of islands and foreshore areas, swimming spots, bushwalking tracks and picnic areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/sydney-harbour-national-park|title=Sydney Harbour National Park|website=NSW National Parks}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sydney Cove, Port Jackson in the County of Cumberland - F.

The Gadigal inhabited the land stretching along the south side of Port Jackson from what is now South Head, in an arc west to the present Darling Harbour.

Phillip first stayed over night at [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Camp Cove]], then moved down the harbour, landing at Sydney Cove and then Manly Cove before returning to Botany Bay on the afternoon of 24 January. Phillip returned to Sydney Cove in HM Armed Tender ''[[HMS Supply (1759)|Supply]]'' on 26 January 1788, where he established the first [[colony]] in Australia, later to become the city of Sydney.

It spanned the harbour from Green (Laings) Point, [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] to the [[artillery battery|battery]] at [[Georges Head Battery|Georges Head]], on the other side of the harbour. On the night of 31 May 1942, [[Attack on Sydney Harbour|three Japanese midget submarines]] entered the harbour, one of which became entangled in the western end of the boom net's central section. Unable to free their submarine, the crew detonated charges, killing themselves in the process. A second midget submarine came to grief in Taylor's Bay, the two crew committing suicide. The third submarine fired two torpedoes at [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|USS ''Chicago'']] (both missed) before leaving the harbour.

S. Lewis]], set on the planet of Perelandra, or Venus. It was first published in 1943.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe story starts with the [[philology|philologist]] [[Elwin Ransom]], some years after his return from [[Mars]] at the end of ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', receiving a new mission from the [[Oyarsa]] (the angelic ruler) of Mars. Ransom summons narrator-Lewis to his country home. Ransom explains to Lewis that he (Ransom) is to travel to Perelandra ([[Venus]]), where he is to counter some kind of attack launched by Earth's Black Archon ([[Satan]]).\n\nRansom is transported in a casket-like vessel seemingly made of ice, which contains only himself. He gets Lewis to blindfold him so the sunlight will not blind him once he travels beyond the earth's atmosphere. He does not wear any clothes on the journey as Oyarsa tells him clothes are unnecessary on Venus. He returns to Earth over a year later and is met by Lewis and another friend. The remainder of the story is told from Ransom's point of view, with Lewis acting as interlocutor and occasional commentator.\n\nRansom arrives in Venus after a journey in which he is surrounded by bright colours; the box dissolves leaving Ransom on what appears to be an [[Ocean planet|oceanic]] paradise. One day is about 23 Earth hours, in contrast to the (roughly) 24 and 25-hour days of Earth and Mars. The sky is golden but opaque. Hence the sun cannot be seen, daylight is somewhat dimmer than on Earth, and the night is pitch black with no stars visible.\n\nThe planet is covered, so far as Ransom can at first see, by a sweet-water ocean, which is dotted with floating [[raft]]s of vegetation. These rafts resemble islands, to the extent of having plant and animal life upon them, including a kind of dragon-like creature encountered by Ransom early in his visit.  However, as the rafts have no geologic foundations, they are in a constant state of motion. The planet's sole observable geological feature is a mountain called the Fixed Land.\n\nRansom soon meets the Queen of the planet, whose name is later revealed to be Tinidril; she is a carefree being who soon accepts him as a friend. Unlike the inhabitants of Mars in ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', she resembles a human in physical appearance with the exception of her skin colour, green; this is said to be the preferred form assumed by sentient creatures as a result of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of Maleldil, the second person of [[God in Christianity|God]], in human form. She and the King of the planet, who is largely unseen until the end, are the only human inhabitants and are the Eve and Adam of their world. They live on the floating raft-islands and are forbidden to sleep on the \"Fixed Land\".\n\nThe rafts or floating islands are indeed Paradise, not only in the sense that they provide a pleasant and care-free life but also in the sense that Ransom is for weeks and months naked in the presence of a beautiful naked woman without once lusting after her or being tempted to seduce her.\n\nThis Paradise changes when [[Professor Weston]] arrives in a spaceship and lands in a part of the ocean quite close to the Fixed Land. He at first announces to Ransom that he is a reformed man, but appears to still be in search of power. Instead of the strictly [[materialist]] attitude he displayed when first meeting Ransom, he asserts he had become aware of the existence of spiritual beings and pledges allegiance to what he calls the \"Life-Force\". Ransom, however, warns against Weston's position that not all spirituality is inherently good, and Weston, after a fit of pride, succumbs to full [[demonic possession]].\n\nIn this state, the possessed Weston finds the Queen and tries to tempt her into defying Maleldil's law by spending a night on the Fixed Land. Ransom tries to counter this. Well versed in the [[Bible]] and [[Christian theology]], Ransom realises that if the pristine Queen, who has never heard of [[Evil]], succumbs to the tempter's arguments, [[the Fall of Man]] will be re-enacted on Perelandra. He struggles through day after day of lengthy arguments tempting the Queen to spiritual pride, as the demonic Weston shows super-human brilliance in debate (though when \"off-duty\" he displays moronic, asinine behaviour and petty cruelty) and moreover appears never to need sleep.\n\nWith the demonic Weston on the verge of winning, the desperate Ransom senses in the night what he gradually realises is a Divine command to battle the Tempter physically, hand to hand. The bookish Ransom is afraid, and debates for hours with the divine inner voice. A curious twist is introduced here; although Ransom knows that his name derives historically from \"Ranolf's Son\", God reminds him that the [[Passion of Jesus]] was a ransom for humanity, and Ransom's name was actually arranged to foreshadow his present role. Inspired, Ransom decides to confront the Tempter outright.\n\nWith no weapons to hand, Ransom attacks his opponent with clumsy punches and kicks. Weston's body is defeated despite the Tempter's superior guile, and he flees.  Ultimately Ransom chases Weston over the ocean on the backs of giant friendly [[fish]]. During a feigned truce, the \"real\" Weston temporarily re-emerges to recount his experience of [[Hell]], the horror of being \"digested\" into the [[Devil]], losing all independent existence.\n\nThe moment Ransom is distracted by horror and pity, the demon takes Ransom by surprise and nearly drowns him. The chase continues into a cavern, where Ransom seemingly kills Weston's body and, believing his quest over, searches for the surface. Weston's body, horribly injured but still animated by the Tempter, follows him. When they meet for the last time in another cavern, Ransom defeats a psychological assault by a gruesome apparition, and finally throws Weston into the volcanic flames.\n\nReturning to the surface, Ransom recuperates from his injuries, except for a bite on his heel which continues bleeding for the rest of his life. Ransom carves a memorial inscription for Weston, to commemorate his scientific achievements and pioneering space travel, though also recording his surrender to the Devil.\n\nRansom meets the King and Queen together with the [[Oyarsa|Oy\u00e9resu]] of Mars and Venus, the latter of whom transfers dominion of the planet to the King and Queen. All the characters celebrate the prevention of a second biblical \"Fall\" and the beginning of a [[utopia]]n paradise in this new world. The story climaxes with Ransom's vision of \"The Great Dance\": the exchange of higher and lower, as when an advisor gives power to a royal child. This is an allegory of life, and possibly of the nature of [[God]], and alludes to the journey of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Divine Comedy]].\n\nHis mission finished, Ransom reluctantly returns to Earth; his new mission is to continue to fight evil on its home territory: the Earth.\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1943, UK, The Bodley Head, N/A, 20 April 1943, hardback (first edition)\n* 1996, USA, Simon & Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-83365-4}}, pub date ?

S. Lewis]], set on the planet of Perelandra, or Venus. It was first published in 1943.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe story starts with the [[philology|philologist]] [[Elwin Ransom]], some years after his return from [[Mars]] at the end of ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', receiving a new mission from the [[Oyarsa]] (the angelic ruler) of Mars. Ransom summons narrator-Lewis to his country home. Ransom explains to Lewis that he (Ransom) is to travel to Perelandra ([[Venus]]), where he is to counter some kind of attack launched by Earth's Black Archon ([[Satan]]).\n\nRansom is transported in a casket-like vessel seemingly made of ice, which contains only himself. He gets Lewis to blindfold him so the sunlight will not blind him once he travels beyond the earth's atmosphere. He does not wear any clothes on the journey as Oyarsa tells him clothes are unnecessary on Venus. He returns to Earth over a year later and is met by Lewis and another friend. The remainder of the story is told from Ransom's point of view, with Lewis acting as interlocutor and occasional commentator.\n\nRansom arrives in Venus after a journey in which he is surrounded by bright colours; the box dissolves leaving Ransom on what appears to be an [[Ocean planet|oceanic]] paradise. One day is about 23 Earth hours, in contrast to the (roughly) 24 and 25-hour days of Earth and Mars. The sky is golden but opaque. Hence the sun cannot be seen, daylight is somewhat dimmer than on Earth, and the night is pitch black with no stars visible.\n\nThe planet is covered, so far as Ransom can at first see, by a sweet-water ocean, which is dotted with floating [[raft]]s of vegetation. These rafts resemble islands, to the extent of having plant and animal life upon them, including a kind of dragon-like creature encountered by Ransom early in his visit.  However, as the rafts have no geologic foundations, they are in a constant state of motion. The planet's sole observable geological feature is a mountain called the Fixed Land.\n\nRansom soon meets the Queen of the planet, whose name is later revealed to be Tinidril; she is a carefree being who soon accepts him as a friend. Unlike the inhabitants of Mars in ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', she resembles a human in physical appearance with the exception of her skin colour, green; this is said to be the preferred form assumed by sentient creatures as a result of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of Maleldil, the second person of [[God in Christianity|God]], in human form. She and the King of the planet, who is largely unseen until the end, are the only human inhabitants and are the Eve and Adam of their world. They live on the floating raft-islands and are forbidden to sleep on the \"Fixed Land\".\n\nThe rafts or floating islands are indeed Paradise, not only in the sense that they provide a pleasant and care-free life but also in the sense that Ransom is for weeks and months naked in the presence of a beautiful naked woman without once lusting after her or being tempted to seduce her.\n\nThis Paradise changes when [[Professor Weston]] arrives in a spaceship and lands in a part of the ocean quite close to the Fixed Land. He at first announces to Ransom that he is a reformed man, but appears to still be in search of power. Instead of the strictly [[materialist]] attitude he displayed when first meeting Ransom, he asserts he had become aware of the existence of spiritual beings and pledges allegiance to what he calls the \"Life-Force\". Ransom, however, warns against Weston's position that not all spirituality is inherently good, and Weston, after a fit of pride, succumbs to full [[demonic possession]].\n\nIn this state, the possessed Weston finds the Queen and tries to tempt her into defying Maleldil's law by spending a night on the Fixed Land. Ransom tries to counter this. Well versed in the [[Bible]] and [[Christian theology]], Ransom realises that if the pristine Queen, who has never heard of [[Evil]], succumbs to the tempter's arguments, [[the Fall of Man]] will be re-enacted on Perelandra. He struggles through day after day of lengthy arguments tempting the Queen to spiritual pride, as the demonic Weston shows super-human brilliance in debate (though when \"off-duty\" he displays moronic, asinine behaviour and petty cruelty) and moreover appears never to need sleep.\n\nWith the demonic Weston on the verge of winning, the desperate Ransom senses in the night what he gradually realises is a Divine command to battle the Tempter physically, hand to hand.
