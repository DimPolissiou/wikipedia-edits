Released on December 22, 1978, it is a remake of ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956), which is based on the novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'' by [[Jack Finney]]. The plot involves a San Francisco health inspector and his colleague who discover that humans are being replaced by alien duplicates; each is a perfect copy of the person replaced, only devoid of human emotion.\n\nReleased in the United States over the Christmas weekend 1978, ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' grossed nearly $25 million at the box office. It initially received varied reviews from critics, though its critical reception has significantly improved in subsequent years, receiving a 93% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and also being hailed as one of the greatest remakes ever as well as one of the best science-fiction horror films of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1010679_invasion_of_the_body_snatchers|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|access-date=May 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA race of [[gelatin]]ous [[Extraterrestrial life|creatures]] abandon their dying planet and travel to Earth, landing in San Francisco. They take the form of small pods with pink flowers. Elizabeth Driscoll, a laboratory scientist at the San Francisco Health Department, brings one of the flowers to her home. She awakens the next morning to discover her boyfriend, Geoffrey Howell, acting cold and distant.\n\nDriscoll's colleague, Matthew Bennell, advises her to visit psychiatrist David Kibner, who is giving a presentation of his new book. As Elizabeth and Matthew drive to the presentation, a hysterical civilian warns them of danger before being killed in a [[hit and run]], with his body being observed by emotionless onlookers. At the bookstore, Elizabeth asks Kibner for help regarding Geoffrey, but he theorizes that Elizabeth is using the belief that Geoffrey is behaving differently as an excuse to interrupt their relationship. Meanwhile, Jack Bellicec, an aspiring writer and friend of Matthew, calls Matthew to investigate when a deformed body resembling Jack is found in his wife Nancy's [[bathhouse|mud parlor]]. Matthew goes to Elizabeth to warn her, but discovers a semi-formed duplicate of her.\n\nMatthew rescues Elizabeth and alerts the police, but the duplicates of Jack and Elizabeth disappear before their arrival. Elizabeth deduces that the flowers are involved and examines it at the health department, failing to find records of it, whilst Matthew unsuccessfully attempts to alert several government agencies and discovers that several close friends and associates have been duplicated. At night, Matthew and his friends are nearly duplicated as they sleep. Matthew calls the police, but realizes that the department has been duplicated.\n\nMatthew destroys the duplicates with a garden hoe before escaping with the others. The \"Pods\" \u2013 extraterrestrials who take the forms of humans and kill the originals in their sleep \u2013 set off in pursuit of Matthew's group. The Pods emit a shrill scream when they discover a human being among them. Jack and Nancy create a distraction, allowing Matthew and Elizabeth to escape back into the city. Matthew and Elizabeth take refuge in the health department, where they take a large dose of [[amphetamine|speed]], keeping them awake for several more hours. They are soon captured by Jack and Kibner, who were previously duplicated, and injected with sedatives whilst being informed of their intentions for survivability, though their previous dose of speed enables them to escape and kill Jack\u2019s duplicate whilst locking Kibner in a refrigerated room.\n\n[[File:Donald Sutherland bodysnatchers scream.jpg|thumb|right|At the ''denoument'', Matthew ([[Donald Sutherland]]) demonstrates the characteristic pose by which pods identify unconverted humans.]]Matthew and Elizabeth reunite with Nancy, who has learnt to evade the Pods through hiding her emotions. The two follow her example, but their cover is blown when Elizabeth screams at the sight of a [[mutant]] dog with a human face. They separate from Nancy in their escape and quickly board a truck delivering the plants to [[Pier 70, San Francisco|Pier 70]], where the Pods are growing them and intending to ship them overseas to other widely populated cities. Whilst Matthew scouts the area in an attempt to flee aboard a vacant ship, Elizabeth soon falls asleep and is duplicated before the former returns. Horrified and enraged, Matthew breaks into the docks' warehouse and burns down the building, destroying several plants and killing many Pods. After that, he hides underneath the pier as more Pods arrive and continuously search for him.\n\nThe next morning, Matthew returns at the health department and witnesses several schoolchildren being taken for duplication whilst more plants are being prepared for the remaining West Coast cities. As he heads towards [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]], Matthew encounters Nancy, who quietly reaches out to him for help. However, Matthew points out his finger towards Nancy and emits an earsplitting shriek. To her horror, Nancy realizes that Matthew has become a Pod and that she is one of the few remaining humans in the city, and screams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Matthew Bennell\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Elizabeth Driscoll\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Dr. David Kibner\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Jack Bellicec\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Nancy Bellicec\n* [[Art Hindle]] as Dr. Geoffrey Howell\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Katherine Hendley\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Running Man,{{sfn|Booker|2006|p=72}}  who played Dr. Miles Bennell in the original ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''\n* [[Don Siegel]] as Taxi Driver.

It can be a new envisioning that was a variation on a theme,' he said on the film's 40th anniversary. The first change he anticipated was filming in color; the second was changing the location to [[San Francisco]]. \"Could it happen in the city I love the most? The city with the most advanced, progressive therapies, politics and so forth? What would happen in a place like that if the pods landed there and that element of 'poddiness' was spread?\"<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\">{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=David|title=Why 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' Still Haunts Its Director|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/invasion-body-snatchers-ending-still-haunts-director-1170220|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 20, 2018|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Cinematography|Cinematographer]] [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]] worked with Kaufman to try to capture the ''[[film noir]]'' feel of the original in color, reviewing some classics of that genre before production. Some of the things they borrowed were scenes with light giving way to shadow and shooting from unusual angles. They used certain color tinges to indicate that some characters were now pod people. \"When they're running along the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] and the huge shadows appear first, those are sort of classic film noir images\", the director said.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nSound editor [[Ben Burtt]], who had helped create many of the signature sounds from ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' the year before, also added to the film's ambience. Natural sounds that mix with the city's more industrial noises give way to just the latter as the film progresses. Among them are the grinding noises of garbage trucks, a common urban sound that slowly becomes horrific as it becomes clear that most of what they are processing is the discarded husks that remain of pre-pod human bodies. Burtt also designed the iconic shriek when pod people see a surviving human, a sound Kaufman said was composed of many elements, including a pig's squeal.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nAll the special effects were created live for the camera. The scene at the beginning where the pods travel through space from their dead homeworld to San Francisco was one of the simplest. \"I found some viscous material in an art store, I think we paid $12 for a big vat of it, and then [we dropped it] into solutions and reversed the film\", Kaufman recalled. The dog with the banjo player's face, another effective moment later in the film, included a mechanism whereby the creature appeared to lick itself.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nThe film features a number of [[cameo appearance]]s. [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], who played Dr. Miles Bennell in the original ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', makes a brief appearance as an old man frantically screaming \"They're coming!\" to passing cars on the street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aintitcool.com/node/1696|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers ...|work=aintitcool.com|last=Knowles|first=Harry|authorlink=Harry Knowles|date=March 26, 1998|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> Kaufman meant his cameo to link the two movies, as if he had been \"metaphorically\" running around the country since the original film shouting out his warnings. While they were filming the scene, in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]], Kaufman recalls that a naked man lying on the street awoke and recognized McCarthy. After learning that they were filming the remake of the original ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'', he told McCarthy that that film was better. \"We were in the middle of shooting the film and we got our first review!\"<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nThe original film's director, [[Don Siegel]], appears as a taxi driver who alerts the police to Matthew and Elizabeth's attempt to flee the city. [[Robert Duvall]] is also seen briefly as a silent priest sitting on a swing set in the opening scene.{{efn|In the director's commentary on the DVD release, Kaufman states that Duvall, who had worked with him in ''[[The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid]]'', happened to be in San Francisco at the time of filming and did the scene for free. Kaufman states that Duvall's character is the first \"pod person\" to be seen in the film. He was reportedly paid with an [[Eddie Bauer]] coat.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />}} Kaufman appears in dual roles both as a man wearing a hat who bothers Sutherland's character in a phone booth, and the voice of one of the officials Sutherland's character speaks to on the phone. His wife, Rose Kaufman, has a small role at the book party as the woman who argues with Jeff Goldblum's character. Chapman appears twice as a janitor in the health department.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nMcCarthy and Siegel played a role in shaping the film's [[twist ending]]. Before filming, Kaufman had sought out Siegel for advice, and while the two were talking in the latter's office, McCarthy happened to come in. The topic eventually came around to the original film's ending, which they regarded as \"pat\". After coming up with the ending he used, he kept it a secret from everyone involved in the filming except screenwriter [[W.D. Richter]] and producer [[Robert Solo]]. Sutherland was only informed of the scene the night before shooting; Kaufman is not sure Cartwright even knew until Sutherland turned around to point and shriek at her. The studio executives only learned of it when a cut was screened for them at [[George Lucas]]'s house.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nThe [[film score]] by [[Denny Zeitlin]] was released on [[Perseverance Records]]; it is the only film score Zeitlin has composed.<ref name=music>{{cite interview|interviewer=Monk Rowe|publisher=[[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Jazz Archive Jazz Archive|year=2002|last=Zeitlin|first=Denny|title=Denny Zeitlin: Invasion of the Body Snatchers}}</ref> [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] recorded the banjo parts.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nKaufman said of the casting of Nimoy, \"Leonard had got typecast and this [film] was an attempt to break him out of that,\" referring to the similar quirks that Dr. Kibner and his pod double had in common with [[Spock]], the ''[[Star Trek]]'' character that Nimoy was most well known for. According to Kaufman, it was [[Mike Medavoy]], then head of production at [[United Artists]], who suggested the casting of Donald Sutherland. Sutherland's character had a similar curly hairstyle as that of another character he portrayed in ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973). \"They would have to set his hair with pink rollers every day\", recalled co-star Veronica Cartwright.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers|url=http://www.thefancan.com/fancandy/features/moviefeatures/bodysnatchers.html|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}</ref> According to Zeitlin, Sutherland's character was originally written as an \"avocational jazz player\" early in development.<ref name=music/>\n\nThe director encouraged his actors to fill the spaces between dialogue with facial expressions. \"Often people on the set or at the studio are so worried about just getting content, and content is not necessarily going to make the scene full of humanity or feel compassion and amusement and humor\", Kaufman told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. He particularly singled out the way Adams rolls her eyes in opposite directions while she and Sutherland have dinner as something that a pod person could and would never do.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' premiered in the United States on December 22, 1978,<ref name=afi>{{cite web|work=[[American Film Institute]] Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/56556?sid=dace5afc-3d77-45b1-8ab8-7d7e9e095fa3&sr=6.143774&cp=1&pos=0|accessdate=May 1, 2018|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)}}</ref> showing on 445 screens nationally.<ref name=bom/> Between its premiere and December 25, the film had earned a total of $1,298,129 in box office sales.<ref name=bom/> It would go on to gross a total of nearly $25 million in the United States.<ref name=bom>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=invasionofthebodysnatchers.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Box Office Information|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the film's 40th anniversary, Kaufman believes the film may have seemed timely when it came out since the [[Jonestown]] mass suicide had occurred a month earlier and still dominated the news: \"That was a case of a lot of people from San Francisco were looking for a better world and suddenly found themselves in pod-dom, and it was fatal.

Released on December 22, 1978, it is a remake of ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956), which is based on the novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'' by [[Jack Finney]]. The plot involves a San Francisco health inspector and his colleague who discover that humans are being replaced by alien duplicates; each is a perfect copy of the person replaced, only devoid of human emotion.\n\nReleased in the United States over the Christmas weekend 1978, ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' grossed nearly $25 million at the box office. It initially received varied reviews from critics, though its critical reception has significantly improved in subsequent years, receiving a 93% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and also being hailed as one of the greatest remakes ever as well as one of the best science-fiction horror films of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1010679_invasion_of_the_body_snatchers|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|access-date=May 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA race of [[gelatin]]ous [[Extraterrestrial life|creatures]] abandon their dying planet and travel to Earth, landing in San Francisco. They take the form of small pods with pink flowers. Elizabeth Driscoll, a laboratory scientist at the San Francisco Health Department, brings one of the flowers to her home. She awakens the next morning to discover her boyfriend, Geoffrey Howell, acting cold and distant.\n\nDriscoll's colleague, Matthew Bennell, advises her to visit psychiatrist David Kibner, who is giving a presentation of his new book. As Elizabeth and Matthew drive to the presentation, a hysterical civilian warns them of danger before being killed in a [[hit and run]], with his body being observed by emotionless onlookers. At the bookstore, Elizabeth asks Kibner for help regarding Geoffrey, but he theorizes that Elizabeth is using the belief that Geoffrey is behaving differently as an excuse to interrupt their relationship. Meanwhile, Jack Bellicec, an aspiring writer and friend of Matthew, calls Matthew to investigate when a deformed body resembling Jack is found in his wife Nancy's [[bathhouse|mud parlor]]. Matthew goes to Elizabeth to warn her, but discovers a semi-formed duplicate of her.\n\nMatthew rescues Elizabeth and alerts the police, but the duplicates of Jack and Elizabeth disappear before their arrival. Elizabeth deduces that the flowers are involved and examines it at the health department, failing to find records of it, whilst Matthew unsuccessfully attempts to alert several government agencies and discovers that several close friends and associates have been duplicated. At night, Matthew and his friends are nearly duplicated as they sleep. Matthew calls the police, but realizes that the department has been duplicated.\n\nMatthew destroys the duplicates with a garden hoe before escaping with the others. The \"Pods\" \u2013 extraterrestrials who take the forms of humans and kill the originals in their sleep \u2013 set off in pursuit of Matthew's group. The Pods emit a shrill scream when they discover a human being among them. Jack and Nancy create a distraction, allowing Matthew and Elizabeth to escape back into the city. Matthew and Elizabeth take refuge in the health department, where they take a large dose of [[amphetamine|speed]], keeping them awake for several more hours. They are soon captured by Jack and Kibner, who were previously duplicated, and injected with sedatives whilst being informed of their intentions for survivability, though their previous dose of speed enables them to escape and kill Jack\u2019s duplicate whilst locking Kibner in a refrigerated room.\n\n[[File:Donald Sutherland bodysnatchers scream.jpg|thumb|right|At the ''denoument'', Matthew ([[Donald Sutherland]]) demonstrates the characteristic pose by which pods identify unconverted humans.]]Matthew and Elizabeth reunite with Nancy, who has learnt to evade the Pods through hiding her emotions. The two follow her example, but their cover is blown when Elizabeth screams at the sight of a [[mutant]] dog with a human face. They separate from Nancy in their escape and quickly board a truck delivering the plants to [[Pier 70, San Francisco|Pier 70]], where the Pods are growing them and intending to ship them overseas to other widely populated cities. Whilst Matthew scouts the area in an attempt to flee aboard a vacant ship, Elizabeth soon falls asleep and is duplicated before the former returns. Horrified and enraged, Matthew breaks into the docks\u2019 warehouse and burns down the building, destroying several plants and killing many Pods. After that, he hides underneath the pier as more Pods arrive and continuously search for him.\n\nThe next morning, Matthew returns at the health department and witnesses several schoolchildren being taken for duplication whilst more plants are being prepared for the remaining West Coast cities. As he heads towards [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]], Matthew encounters Nancy, who quietly reaches out to him for help. However, Matthew points out his finger towards Nancy and emits an earsplitting shriek. To her horror, Nancy realizes that Matthew has become a Pod and that she is one of the few remaining humans in the city, and screams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Matthew Bennell\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Elizabeth Driscoll\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Dr. David Kibner\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Jack Bellicec\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Nancy Bellicec\n* [[Art Hindle]] as Dr. Geoffrey Howell\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Katherine Hendley\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Running Man,{{sfn|Booker|2006|p=72}}  who played Dr. Miles Bennell in the original ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''\n* [[Don Siegel]] as Taxi Driver.

It can be a new envisioning that was a variation on a theme,' he said on the film's 40th anniversary. The first change he anticipated was filming in color; the second was changing the location to [[San Francisco]]. \"Could it happen in the city I love the most? The city with the most advanced, progressive therapies, politics and so forth? What would happen in a place like that if the pods landed there and that element of 'poddiness' was spread?\"<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\">{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=David|title=Why 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' Still Haunts Its Director|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/invasion-body-snatchers-ending-still-haunts-director-1170220|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 20, 2018|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Cinematography|Cinematographer]] [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]] worked with Kaufman to try to capture the ''[[film noir]]'' feel of the original in color, reviewing some classics of that genre before production. Some of the things they borrowed were scenes with light giving way to shadow and shooting from unusual angles. They used certain color tinges to indicate that some characters were now pod people. \"When they're running along the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] and the huge shadows appear first, those are sort of classic film noir images\", the director said.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nSound editor [[Ben Burtt]], who had helped create many of the signature sounds from ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' the year before, also added to the film's ambience. Natural sounds that mix with the city's more industrial noises give way to just the latter as the film progresses. Among them are the grinding noises of garbage trucks, a common urban sound that slowly becomes horrific as it becomes clear that most of what they are processing is the discarded husks that remain of pre-pod human bodies. Burtt also designed the iconic shriek when pod people see a surviving human, a sound Kaufman said was composed of many elements, including a pig's squeal.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nAll the special effects were created live for the camera. The scene at the beginning where the pods travel through space from their dead homeworld to San Francisco was one of the simplest. \"I found some viscous material in an art store, I think we paid $12 for a big vat of it, and then [we dropped it] into solutions and reversed the film\", Kaufman recalled. The dog with the banjo player's face, another effective moment later in the film, included a mechanism whereby the creature appeared to lick itself.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nThe film features a number of [[cameo appearance]]s. [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], who played Dr. Miles Bennell in the original ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', makes a brief appearance as an old man frantically screaming \"They're coming!\" to passing cars on the street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aintitcool.com/node/1696|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers ...|work=aintitcool.com|last=Knowles|first=Harry|authorlink=Harry Knowles|date=March 26, 1998|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> Kaufman meant his cameo to link the two movies, as if he had been \"metaphorically\" running around the country since the original film shouting out his warnings. While they were filming the scene, in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]], Kaufman recalls that a naked man lying on the street awoke and recognized McCarthy. After learning that they were filming the remake of the original ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'', he told McCarthy that that film was better. \"We were in the middle of shooting the film and we got our first review!\"<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nThe original film's director, [[Don Siegel]], appears as a taxi driver who alerts the police to Matthew and Elizabeth's attempt to flee the city. [[Robert Duvall]] is also seen briefly as a silent priest sitting on a swing set in the opening scene.{{efn|In the director's commentary on the DVD release, Kaufman states that Duvall, who had worked with him in ''[[The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid]]'', happened to be in San Francisco at the time of filming and did the scene for free. Kaufman states that Duvall's character is the first \"pod person\" to be seen in the film. He was reportedly paid with an [[Eddie Bauer]] coat.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />}} Kaufman appears in dual roles both as a man wearing a hat who bothers Sutherland's character in a phone booth, and the voice of one of the officials Sutherland's character speaks to on the phone. His wife, Rose Kaufman, has a small role at the book party as the woman who argues with Jeff Goldblum's character. Chapman appears twice as a janitor in the health department.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nMcCarthy and Siegel played a role in shaping the film's [[twist ending]]. Before filming, Kaufman had sought out Siegel for advice, and while the two were talking in the latter's office, McCarthy happened to come in. The topic eventually came around to the original film's ending, which they regarded as \"pat\". After coming up with the ending he used, he kept it a secret from everyone involved in the filming except screenwriter [[W.D. Richter]] and producer [[Robert Solo]]. Sutherland was only informed of the scene the night before shooting; Kaufman is not sure Cartwright even knew until Sutherland turned around to point and shriek at her. The studio executives only learned of it when a cut was screened for them at [[George Lucas]]'s house.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nThe [[film score]] by [[Denny Zeitlin]] was released on [[Perseverance Records]]; it is the only film score Zeitlin has composed.<ref name=music>{{cite interview|interviewer=Monk Rowe|publisher=[[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Jazz Archive Jazz Archive|year=2002|last=Zeitlin|first=Denny|title=Denny Zeitlin: Invasion of the Body Snatchers}}</ref> [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] recorded the banjo parts.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\nKaufman said of the casting of Nimoy, \"Leonard had got typecast and this [film] was an attempt to break him out of that,\" referring to the similar quirks that Dr. Kibner and his pod double had in common with [[Spock]], the ''[[Star Trek]]'' character that Nimoy was most well known for. According to Kaufman, it was [[Mike Medavoy]], then head of production at [[United Artists]], who suggested the casting of Donald Sutherland. Sutherland's character had a similar curly hairstyle as that of another character he portrayed in ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973). \"They would have to set his hair with pink rollers every day\", recalled co-star Veronica Cartwright.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers|url=http://www.thefancan.com/fancandy/features/moviefeatures/bodysnatchers.html|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}</ref> According to Zeitlin, Sutherland's character was originally written as an \"avocational jazz player\" early in development.<ref name=music/>\n\nThe director encouraged his actors to fill the spaces between dialogue with facial expressions. \"Often people on the set or at the studio are so worried about just getting content, and content is not necessarily going to make the scene full of humanity or feel compassion and amusement and humor\", Kaufman told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. He particularly singled out the way Adams rolls her eyes in opposite directions while she and Sutherland have dinner as something that a pod person could and would never do.<ref name=\"40th anniversary story\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' premiered in the United States on December 22, 1978,<ref name=afi>{{cite web|work=[[American Film Institute]] Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/56556?sid=dace5afc-3d77-45b1-8ab8-7d7e9e095fa3&sr=6.143774&cp=1&pos=0|accessdate=May 1, 2018|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)}}</ref> showing on 445 screens nationally.<ref name=bom/> Between its premiere and December 25, the film had earned a total of $1,298,129 in box office sales.<ref name=bom/> It would go on to gross a total of nearly $25 million in the United States.<ref name=bom>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=invasionofthebodysnatchers.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Box Office Information|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the film's 40th anniversary, Kaufman believes the film may have seemed timely when it came out since the [[Jonestown]] mass suicide had occurred a month earlier and still dominated the news: \"That was a case of a lot of people from San Francisco were looking for a better world and suddenly found themselves in pod-dom, and it was fatal.

At the airport, Kumar argues with a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent for searching him \u201cbecause of the color of his skin\u201d despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's [[bong]] for a [[bomb]] and the duo are apprehended by [[sky marshal]]s. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], believes the duo are agents of a joint [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[North Korea]]n conspiracy and send them to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]]. After narrowly avoiding a sexual assault by a guard at the detention camp, Harold and Kumar escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to [[Miami, Florida]] where they begin their trek to [[Texas]], hoping Colton can clear their names.\n\nHarold and Kumar endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son; escaping a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally; and visiting a brothel with [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who helps them evade capture from Fox but is shot. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to help exonerate the duo. However, upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers Harold and Kumar to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox's men. When Fox tries confronting them, he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher (the [[Vice Chairman]] of the [[NSA]]) after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. Dr. Beecher accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. Harold and Kumar land in [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s estate. After smoking [[cannabis]] with Harold and Kumar, Bush pardons them. Harold and Kumar are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. They then expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college; they reconcile. Harold, Kumar, and Vanessa travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria, and the couples happily tour the city together while getting high on cannabis.\n\nIn an end-credits scene, Neil Patrick Harris awakens.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Cho]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Harold Lee|Harold Lee]], a Korean-American stoner, and Kumar Patel's best friend.\n* [[Kal Penn]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Kumar Patel|Kumar Patel]], an Indian-American stoner, and Harold Lee's best friend.\n* [[Danneel Harris]] as Vanessa Fanning, Kumar's ex-girlfriend and Colton's fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Ron Fox, a neurotic and racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Dr. John Beecher, the Vice Chairman of the [[NSA]] who acts as the rational counterpoint in relation to Fox.\n* [[Eric Winter]] as Colton Graham, Vanessa's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Neil Patrick Harris|a fictionalized, drug-addled, whoremongering version of himself]].\n* [[Paula Garc\u00e9s]] as Maria, Harold's love interest.\n* [[Amir Talai]] as Raza Syed, a close friend of Harold and Kumar.\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Rosenberg and Goldstein|Goldstein]]\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Rosenberg and Goldstein|Rosenberg]]\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Grand Wizard (credited as Reverend Clyde Stanky)\n* [[Richard Christy]] as Kenny\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Mr. Lee\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Sally\n* [[Jon Reep]] as Raymus\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Interpreter\n* [[Adam Herschman]] as Archie\n* [[Jack Conley (actor)|Jack Conley]] as Deputy Frye\n* [[Tamara Feldman]] as Chloe\n* Ava Santana as Tammi\n* [[Randal Reeder]] as Big Bob\n* [[James Adomian]] as [[George W.

At the airport, Kumar argues with a [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent for searching him \u201cbecause of the color of his skin\u201d despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's [[bong]] for a [[bomb]] and the duo are apprehended by [[sky marshal]]s. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], believes the duo are agents of a joint [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[North Korea]]n conspiracy and send them to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]]. After narrowly avoiding a sexual assault by a guard at the detention camp, Harold and Kumar escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to [[Miami, Florida]] where they begin their trek to [[Texas]], hoping Colton can clear their names.\n\nHarold and Kumar endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son; escaping a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally; and visiting a brothel with [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who helps them evade capture from Fox but is shot. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to help exonerate the duo. However, upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers Harold and Kumar to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox's men. When Fox tries confronting them, he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher (the [[Vice Chairman]] of the [[NSA]]) after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. Dr. Beecher accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. Harold and Kumar land in [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s estate. After smoking [[cannabis]] with Harold and Kumar, Bush pardons them. Harold and Kumar are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. They then expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college; they reconcile. Harold, Kumar, and Vanessa travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria, and the couples happily tour the city together while getting high on cannabis.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Cho]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Harold Lee|Harold Lee]], a Korean-American stoner, and Kumar Patel's best friend.\n* [[Kal Penn]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Kumar Patel|Kumar Patel]], an Indian-American stoner, and Harold Lee's best friend.\n* [[Danneel Harris]] as Vanessa Fanning, Kumar's ex-girlfriend and Colton's fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Ron Fox, a neurotic and racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Dr. John Beecher, the Vice Chairman of the [[NSA]] who acts as the rational counterpoint in relation to Fox.\n* [[Eric Winter]] as Colton Graham, Vanessa's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Neil Patrick Harris|a fictionalized, drug-addled, whoremongering version of himself]].\n* [[Paula Garc\u00e9s]] as Maria, Harold's love interest.\n* [[Amir Talai]] as Raza Syed, a close friend of Harold and Kumar.\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Rosenberg and Goldstein|Goldstein]]\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Rosenberg and Goldstein|Rosenberg]]\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Grand Wizard (credited as Reverend Clyde Stanky)\n* [[Richard Christy]] as Kenny\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Mr. Lee\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Sally\n* [[Jon Reep]] as Raymus\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Interpreter\n* [[Adam Herschman]] as Archie\n* [[Jack Conley (actor)|Jack Conley]] as Deputy Frye\n* [[Tamara Feldman]] as Chloe\n* Ava Santana as Tammi\n* [[Randal Reeder]] as Big Bob\n* [[James Adomian]] as [[George W.

There are significant populations at Wagga Wagga and Leeton and smaller groups at West Wyalong, Parkes, Dubbo, Forbes, Cootamundra, Cowra and Young.\n\n=== European exploration ===\nThe explorers [[Hume and Hovell expedition|Hume and Hovell]] arrived at what their maps called 'Crossing Point', but is now known as the [[Murray River]] at Albury, on 16 November 1824. They named the river the ''Hume River'', after Hume's father, and the next day inscribed a tree by the river bank before continuing their journey south to Westernport in Victoria. In 1830, explorer Captain [[Charles Sturt]] discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Not realising it was the same river, he named it the Murray River.<ref name=speake>{{cite book|last1=Speake|first1=Jennifer|title=Literature of Travel and Exploration: R to Z|date=2003|publisher=[[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=1-57958-440-3|page=1154|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lCUz-XMay4oC&pg=PA1154|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray. The Aboriginal name for the river was ''Millewa''. A crossing place for the Murray became popular close to where Hovell inscribed the tree. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In summer it was usually possible to cross the river by foot.\n\n=== European settlement ===\nAmong the first [[Squatting#Australia|squatters]] to follow in the steps of the explorers and settle in the district were William Wyse and [[Charles Ebden]].\n\nThe first European buildings erected at the crossing place were a provisions store and some small huts. A survey for a town was commissioned in 1838 by Assistant Surveyor [[Thomas Townsend]] who mapped out Wodonga Place (the present Wodonga Place) as the western boundary, Hume Street as the northern boundary, Kiewa Street to the east and Nurigong Street to the south, with Townsend Street being the only other north\u2013south road, and Ebden and Hovell sreets being the two other east\u2013west roads. Townsend proposed the settlement be named 'Bungambrewatha', the Aboriginal name for the area, but when his plan was eventually approved and published in the Government Gazette on 13 April 1839 the name had been changed to Albury.<ref name=\"GNBofNSW\">{{NSW GNR|id=MnqwlM|title=Albury|accessdate=16 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nAlbury is said to be named after a village in [[Kent]], England which it apparently resembled.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55185386 |title=PLACE NAMES. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=13 May 1964 |accessdate=22 February 2011 |page=61 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== Frontier town ===\nBy 1847 the Albury settlement included two [[public house]]s and a handful of huts, a police barracks and a blacksmiths.

With an increase in commerce with Melbourne, the first bridge was built in 1860 to the design of surveyor [[William Snell Chauncy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Albury at this time became a Customs Post between the two colonies as New South Wales held a protectionist stance after gaining its constitution in 1856.\n\nAlbury was at this time starting to grow substantially with [[German settlements in the Riverina|German speaking immigrants]] using the area to grow grapes for wine. By the 1870s a butter factory was established, [[flour mill]], [[Winery|wineries]] and locally brewed [[cider]] and soft drinks were available. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe railway line from Sydney arrived at Albury in 1881 (see [[#Rail|Transport-Rail]] below). A temporary wooden railway bridge joined the line to the Victorian network in 1883. New South Wales and Victoria had different track gauges until 1962, when the first train ran direct from Sydney to Melbourne. The two states could not initially agree which should be the transfer point so they had an expensive and attractive iron lattice bridge sent from Scotland which accommodated both gauges.\n\nIn 1888, Albury built its first school house. The city's first mayor, James Fallon, was an innovator of the [[Public school (government funded)|Public School]], funding a demonstration High School to be built on Kiewa Street. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Albury High School opened in Kiewa Street in 1927.\n\n=== 20th-century city ===\n[[File:Looking down Dean Street Albury (1920s - 1930s) from Monument Hill.jpg|thumb|Overlooking Albury from Monument Hill in the 1920s]]\n\nThe ''Royal Commission on Sites for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth'' report of 1903 recommended Albury (along with [[Tumut]]) as the preferred candidate for the [[capital of Australia|national capital]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=253&Itemid=247|title=History of the Capital|access-date=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821192642/https://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=253&Itemid=247|archive-date=21 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> though the proposal met staunch opposition from residents.<ref name=\"The National Capital 1938. pg. 24\">'The National Capital: Why Albury was not chosen' from The West Australian.

Proclaimed a city in 1946, Albury played a role in the [[post-war immigration to Australia]] with the establishment nearby of Australia's first migrant centre, the [[Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre]] in 1947.\n\nAlbury's proximity to Wodonga has spurred several efforts to achieve some kind of municipal governmental union (see [[Albury-Wodonga]]). In 1973, Albury-Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the [[Whitlam]] federal government's scheme to redirect the uncontrolled growth of Australia's large coastal cities (Sydney and Melbourne in particular) by encouraging decentralisation. Grand plans were made to turn Albury-Wodonga into a major inland city and large areas of the surrounding farmland was compulsorily purchased by the government. Some industries were enticed to move there, and a certain amount of population movement resulted.

Much commercial activity is concentrated here, with Dean Street forming the axis of the main shopping and office district. A cultural precinct is centred on QEII Square, which includes the [[Albury Library Museum]], Murray Art Museum Albury (MAMA), Albury Entertainment Centre and Convention Centre, and the Murray Conservatorium. In the same block are the Post Office, Police Station and Courthouse, and St Matthew's Anglican Church (which was rebuilt after being destroyed by fire in 1990). The Albury City Council offices are located on Kiewa Street.\n\nForrest Hill lies directly north west and covers the saddle between Monument Hill and Nail Can Hill.  West over the ridge lies [[West Albury, New South Wales|West Albury]]. West Albury is primarily a residential area, but it is home to the First World War Memorial (locally known as the Monument), Riverwood Retirement Village, Albury Wodonga Private Hospital (which lies on the corner of Pemberton Street and the Riverina Highway), and the Albury sewage treatment plant. All of West Albury was once wetland and bush. The only remnant of this is Horseshoe Lagoon to the south-west of the suburb, which has been declared a Wildlife Refuge by NSW Parks & Wildlife and incorporated into the Wonga Wetlands.  To the north-west of West Albury is [[Pemberton Park, New South Wales|Pemberton Park]].\n\n[[East Albury, New South Wales|East Albury]] lies east of the railway line/freeway from the CBD and houses now cover the eastern hill alongside the Albury Base Hospital, while the flat land directly north of it is covered by parkland, housing and light industry, and a [[retail park]] including [[Harvey Norman]] and [[Spotlight (store)|Spotlight]] franchises, as well as the [[Albury Airport|city airport]]. The Mungabareena Reserve lies on the Murray south of the airport, and is considered an Aboriginal cultural site of some significance. Mungabareena means \"place of plenty talk\" in the [[Wiradjuri]] language.<ref>[http://www.csu.edu.au/research/ilws/research/docs/summaries/yal-mungabareena-report.pdf Microsoft Word \u2013 nht report 2002.doc].

Flood mitigation works in the 1990s have dramatically reduced the risk of flooding in this area.\n\n[[North Albury, New South Wales|North Albury]] was covered by orchards and vineyards in the first half of the 20th century, and a swamp existed where James Fallon High School now stands. After the World War II, housing development in the area increased and Waugh Road was extended from David Street to the \"Five Ways\" intersection at Union Road, which ascribes the border between North Albury and [[Lavington, New South Wales|Lavington]]. The locality of ''Glenroy'' is adjacent to North Albury, west of the Bungambrawartha Creek, and housing was developed here in the 1970s, including a significant [[Housing NSW|Housing Commission]] public housing estate.\n\n[[Lavington, New South Wales|Lavington]] is the largest suburb of Albury, and the only suburb which has its own postcode (2641, as opposed to 2640 for the balance of Albury).

Albury's lawn cemetery and crematorium lies at the western end of Union Road.\n\n[[Thurgoona, New South Wales|Thurgoona]], to the east of Lavington, was established as a new residential suburb by the [[Albury-Wodonga|Albury Wodonga Development Corporation]] in the 1970s. In the 1990s a new campus of [[Charles Sturt University]] was established here, as was an office of the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre.

Before the construction of the Hume Weir, flows in normal (non-drought) years were low in summer and autumn (though still significant overall), rising in winter due to seasonal rainfall and reaching a flood-peak in late spring due to snow-melt in the Murray and its tributaries' alpine headwaters. The flow is now effectively reversed, with low flows in winter and sustained, relatively high flows in late spring, summer and early autumn to meet irrigation demands, although the spring flood peak has been virtually eliminated.

The bridge is a rare example of a metal arch bridge in New South Wales, and is the oldest of only two such bridges in New South Wales, the other being the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Smollet Street Bridge over Bungambrawatha Creek |work=Heritage and conservation register |publisher=[[Roads and Traffic Authority]] |date=13 November 2003 |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301661 |accessdate=28 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:AlburyRailwayStation.jpg|thumb|Albury railway station, built in 1881 in the [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Italianate|Victorian Italianate]] style]]\n[[Albury railway station]] is on the main Sydney-Melbourne railway line. Originally, New South Wales and Victoria had different [[track gauge]]s, which meant that all travellers in either direction had to change trains at Albury. To accommodate this, a very long [[railway platform]] was needed; the {{convert|450|m|adj=on}} long covered platform is one of the longest in Australia.<ref name=platform>{{cite web|title=Albury anything but borderline|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/country-living/travel/albury-anything-but-borderline/story-fnkeraqd-1226776867017|website=weeklytimesnow.com.au|publisher=[[The Weekly Times]]|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> The broad gauge section of track between Seymour and Albury has now been converted to standard gauge; there is no longer a [[break of gauge|break-of-gauge]] at Albury station. The station is served by a three daily [[V/Line]] train services from Melbourne (terminating at Albury) and the [[NSW TrainLink]] Melbourne-Sydney [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] service, which runs twice daily in each direction.\n[[File:Albury railway station tracks and platform.JPG|left|thumb|The tracks and long platform]]\nIn 1873, the {{convert|5|ft|3|in|adj=on}} [[broad gauge]] railway line from Melbourne reached the township of Belvoir/Wodonga. In 1881, the New South Wales {{convert|4|ft|8.5|in|adj=on}} [[standard gauge]] railway line reached Albury, with a railway bridge joining the two colonies in 1883. Albury became the stop over, where passengers on the Melbourne-Sydney journey changed trains until 1962, when a standard gauge track was opened between the two capitals. After World War II, in an attempt to overcome the difference in gauges and speed up traffic, a [[bogie exchange]] device lifted freight wagons and carriages allowing workers to refit rolling stock with different gauged wheel-sets.\n\nThe break of railway gauge at Albury was a major impediment to Australia's war effort and infrastructure during both World Wars, as every soldier, every item of equipment, and all supplies had to be off-loaded from the broad gauge and reloaded onto a standard gauge railway wagon on the opposite side of the platform. In his book ''Tramps Abroad'', writer [[Mark Twain]] spoke of the break of gauge at Albury and changing trains: \"Now comes a singular thing, the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the unaccountable marvel that Australia can show, namely the break of gauge at Albury. Think of the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Fischer, Tim |author-link=Tim Fischer |chapter=Forward |editor=Marsh, Bill 'Swampy' |title=Great Australian Railway Stories |publisher=ABC Books |year=2005 }}</ref>\n\nMilitary armouries and warehouses were established in the vicinity of Albury. Similar stores were also established at [[Tocumwal]] and [[Oaklands, New South Wales|Oaklands]]. The conversion of the broad gauge track to a second standard gauge track, between [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]] and Albury, was substantially completed in 2011.

Other large employers are: The Commercial Club Albury and [[Hume Bank]].\n\nOne of Albury's major employers was DSI Holdings. Originally the Kaitlers Road facility was opened as an expansion for [[Borg-Warner]] in 1971, manufacturing gearboxes for various manufacturers including [[Ford]], [[Holden]] and even [[Maserati]]. At its peak in 1982 it employed 1251 people. The ownership of the plant changed several times - it was sold in 1987 to [[BTR Nylex]]. It was sold again in 2002 to ION Ltd but the company collapsed in 2004 with debt to creditors of $550 million. Due to a failed deal with General Motors Holden the workforce was reduced to 750 people. Chinese car manufacturer [[Geely Group]] then purchased the bankrupt DSI company for $48 million in March 2009 and the plant then exported automatic transmissions to Geely, [[Ssangyong]] and [[Mahindra & Mahindra Limited|Mahindra]].

Broadcast out of the same building is 105.7 The River, which is also networked to local stations around New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.\n\nAlbury/Wodonga is one radio market, thus advertisements are directed to both sides of the border. The Albury/Wodonga market underwent significant change in 2005 when [[Macquarie Southern Cross Media]] bought 105.7 The River from [[RG Capital Radio Network]], and 2AY and Star FM from the [[DMG Radio Australia]]. Due to cross-media ownership laws preventing the ownership of more than two stations in one market, Macquarie was required to sell one of these stations and in September 2005 sold 2AY to the [[Ace Radio]] network. 2AY takes much of its daytime and evening programming from 3AW in Melbourne.\nThe [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] produces breakfast and morning radio programs through its local radio network, from the studios of [[ABC Goulburn Murray]], 106.5 FM, located in Wodonga.

It is located on the [[Hume Highway]] and the northern side of the [[Murray River]]. Albury is the [[Local government in Australia|seat of local government]] for the council area which also bears the city's name \u2013 the [[City of Albury]].\n\nAlbury has an urban population of 49,172<ref name=\"ABSPopUCL16\"/> and is separated from its twin city in Victoria, [[Wodonga]], by the Murray River. Together, [[Albury\u2013Wodonga|the two cities form an urban area]] with a population of 93,603 at June 2018.<ref name=ABSSUA>{{cite web|title=3218.0 \u2013 Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2017-18: Population Estimates by Significant Urban Area, 2008 to 2018|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3218.02017-18|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=27 March 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019}} Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018.</ref> It is {{convert|554|km|mi}} from the state capital Sydney and {{convert|326|km|mi}} from the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n capital Melbourne.\n\nSaid to be named after a village in England, Albury developed as a major transport link between New South Wales and Victoria and was proclaimed a city in 1946.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Wiradjuri]] people were the first known humans to occupy the area, (Wiradjuri northern dialect pronunciation [wira\u02d0jd\u032au\u02d0raj]) or Wirraayjuurray people (Wiradjuri southern dialect pronunciation [wira\u02d0j\u025fu\u02d0raj]) are a group of Indigenous Australian Aboriginal people that were united by a common language, strong ties of kinship and survived as skilled hunter\u2013fisher\u2013gatherers in family groups or clans scattered throughout central New South Wales.\n\nIn the 21st century, major Wiradjuri groups live in [[Condobolin]], [[Peak Hill, New South Wales|Peak Hill]], [[Narrandera]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]]. There are significant populations at Wagga Wagga and Leeton and smaller groups at West Wyalong, Parkes, Dubbo, Forbes, Cootamundra, Cowra and Young.\n\n=== European exploration ===\nThe explorers [[Hume and Hovell expedition|Hume and Hovell]] arrived at what their maps called 'Crossing Point', but is now known as the [[Murray River]] at Albury, on 16 November 1824. They named the river the ''Hume River'', after Hume's father, and the next day inscribed a tree by the river bank before continuing their journey south to Westernport in Victoria. In 1830, explorer Captain [[Charles Sturt]] discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Not realising it was the same river, he named it the Murray River.<ref name=speake>{{cite book|last1=Speake|first1=Jennifer|title=Literature of Travel and Exploration: R to Z|date=2003|publisher=[[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=1-57958-440-3|page=1154|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lCUz-XMay4oC&pg=PA1154|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray. The Aboriginal name for the river was ''Millewa''. A crossing place for the Murray became popular close to where Hovell inscribed the tree. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In summer it was usually possible to cross the river by foot.\n\n=== European settlement ===\nAmong the first [[Squatting#Australia|squatters]] to follow in the steps of the explorers and settle in the district were William Wyse and [[Charles Ebden]].\n\nThe first European buildings erected at the crossing place were a provisions store and some small huts. A survey for a town was commissioned in 1838 by Assistant Surveyor [[Thomas Townsend]] who mapped out Wodonga Place (the present Wodonga Place) as the western boundary, Hume Street as the northern boundary, Kiewa Street to the east and Nurigong Street to the south, with Townsend Street being the only other north\u2013south road, and Ebden and Hovell sreets being the two other east\u2013west roads. Townsend proposed the settlement be named 'Bungambrewatha', the Aboriginal name for the area, but when his plan was eventually approved and published in the Government Gazette on 13 April 1839 the name had been changed to Albury.<ref name=\"GNBofNSW\">{{NSW GNR|id=MnqwlM|title=Albury|accessdate=16 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nAlbury is said to be named after a village in [[Kent]], England which it apparently resembled.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55185386 |title=PLACE NAMES. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=13 May 1964 |accessdate=22 February 2011 |page=61 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== Frontier town ===\nBy 1847 the Albury settlement included two [[public house]]s and a handful of huts, a police barracks and a blacksmiths.

With an increase in commerce with Melbourne, the first bridge was built in 1860 to the design of surveyor [[William Snell Chauncy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Albury at this time became a Customs Post between the two colonies as New South Wales held a protectionist stance after gaining its constitution in 1856.\n\nAlbury was at this time starting to grow substantially with [[German settlements in the Riverina|German speaking immigrants]] using the area to grow grapes for wine. By the 1870s a butter factory was established, [[flour mill]], [[Winery|wineries]] and locally brewed [[cider]] and soft drinks were available. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe railway line from Sydney arrived at Albury in 1881 (see [[#Rail|Transport-Rail]] below). A temporary wooden railway bridge joined the line to the Victorian network in 1883. New South Wales and Victoria had different track gauges until 1962, when the first train ran direct from Sydney to Melbourne. The two states could not initially agree which should be the transfer point so they had an expensive and attractive iron lattice bridge sent from Scotland which accommodated both gauges.\n\nIn 1888, Albury built its first school house. The city's first mayor, James Fallon, was an innovator of the [[Public school (government funded)|Public School]], funding a demonstration High School to be built on Kiewa Street. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Albury High School opened in Kiewa Street in 1927.\n\n=== 20th century city ===\n[[File:Looking down Dean Street Albury (1920s - 1930s) from Monument Hill.jpg|thumb|Overlooking Albury from Monument Hill in the 1920s]]\n\nThe ''Royal Commission on Sites for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth'' report of 1903 recommended Albury (along with [[Tumut]]) as the preferred candidate for the [[capital of Australia|national capital]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=253&Itemid=247|title=History of the Capital|access-date=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821192642/https://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=253&Itemid=247|archive-date=21 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> though the proposal met staunch opposition from residents.<ref name=\"The National Capital 1938. pg. 24\">'The National Capital: Why Albury was not chosen' from The West Australian.

After refuelling the next day, many local volunteers helped pull the stranded aircraft out of the mud and the aircraft was able to take off and continue to Melbourne where it won first prize in the race's handicap category and was second overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alburycity.nsw.gov.au/help/uiver.htm |title=The Uiver Memorial Aircraft |accessdate=16 June 2008 |work=Albury City website |publisher=Albury City |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719044652/http://www.alburycity.nsw.gov.au/help/uiver.htm |archivedate=19 July 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2006/11/21/1793944.htm?site=goulburnmurray|title= Flight of the Uiver|accessdate=16 June 2008 |date= 21 November 2006|work=ABC Goulburn Murray website |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>\n\nAlbury and Wodonga played a military role in World War II with the establishment of ordnance bases at [[Bandiana]] and [[Bonegilla]]. Proclaimed a city in 1946, Albury played a role in the [[post-war immigration to Australia]] with the establishment nearby of Australia's first migrant centre, the [[Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre]] in 1947.\n\nAlbury's proximity to Wodonga has spurred several efforts to achieve some kind of municipal governmental union (see [[Albury-Wodonga]]). In 1973, Albury-Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the [[Whitlam]] federal government's scheme to redirect the uncontrolled growth of Australia's large coastal cities (Sydney and Melbourne in particular) by encouraging decentralisation. Grand plans were made to turn Albury-Wodonga into a major inland city and large areas of the surrounding farmland was compulsorily purchased by the government. Some industries were enticed to move there, and a certain amount of population movement resulted. However, the current urban population is approximately 92,200.<ref name=ABSSUA/>\n\n==Heritage listings==\n\nThe following buildings, structures, and [[ephemera]] in Albury are listed on various [[heritage register]]s:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Much commercial activity is concentrated here, with Dean Street forming the axis of the main shopping and office district. A cultural precinct is centred on QEII Square, which includes the [[Albury Library Museum]], Murray Art Museum Albury (MAMA), Albury Entertainment Centre and Convention Centre, and the Murray Conservatorium. In the same block are the Post Office, Police Station and Courthouse, and St Matthew's Anglican Church (which was rebuilt after being destroyed by fire in 1990). The Albury City Council offices are located on Kiewa Street.\n\nForrest Hill lies directly north west and covers the saddle between Monument Hill and Nail Can Hill.  West over the ridge lies [[West Albury, New South Wales|West Albury]]. West Albury is primarily a residential area, but it is home to the First World War Memorial (locally known as the Monument), Riverwood Retirement Village, Albury Wodonga Private Hospital (which lies on the corner of Pemberton Street and the Riverina Highway), and the Albury sewage treatment plant. All of West Albury was once wetland and bush. The only remnant of this is Horseshoe Lagoon to the south-west of the suburb, which has been declared a Wildlife Refuge by NSW Parks & Wildlife and incorporated into the Wonga Wetlands.  To the north-west of West Albury is [[Pemberton Park, New South Wales|Pemberton Park]].\n\n[[East Albury, New South Wales|East Albury]] lies east of the railway line/freeway from the CBD and houses now cover the eastern hill alongside the Albury Base Hospital, while the flat land directly north of it is covered by parkland, housing and light industry, and a [[retail park]] including [[Harvey Norman]] and [[Spotlight (store)|Spotlight]] franchises, as well as the [[Albury Airport|city airport]]. The Mungabareena Reserve lies on the Murray south of the airport, and is considered an Aboriginal cultural site of some significance. Mungabareena means \"place of plenty talk\" in the [[Wiradjuri]] language.<ref>[http://www.csu.edu.au/research/ilws/research/docs/summaries/yal-mungabareena-report.pdf Microsoft Word \u2013 nht report 2002.doc].

Flood mitigation works in the 1990s have dramatically reduced the risk of flooding in this area.\n\n[[North Albury, New South Wales|North Albury]] was covered by orchards and vineyards in the first half of the 20th century, and a swamp existed where James Fallon High School now stands. After the World War II, housing development in the area increased and Waugh Road was extended from David Street to the \"Five Ways\" intersection at Union Road, which ascribes the border between North Albury and [[Lavington, New South Wales|Lavington]]. The locality of ''Glenroy'' is adjacent to North Albury, west of the Bungambrawartha Creek, and housing was developed here in the 1970s, including a significant [[Housing NSW|Housing Commission]] public housing estate.\n\n[[Lavington, New South Wales|Lavington]] is the largest suburb of Albury, and the only suburb which has its own postcode (2641, as opposed to 2640 for the balance of Albury).

Before the construction of the Hume Weir, flows in normal (non-drought) years were low in summer and autumn (though still significant overall), rising in winter due to seasonal rainfall and reaching a flood-peak in late spring due to snow-melt in the Murray and its tributaries' alpine headwaters. The flow is now effectively reversed, with low flows in winter and sustained, relatively high flows in late spring, summer and early autumn to meet irrigation demands, although the spring flood peak has been virtually eliminated.

In 1881, the New South Wales {{convert|4|ft|8.5|in|adj=on}} [[standard gauge]] railway line reached Albury, with a railway bridge joining the two colonies in 1883. Albury became the stop over, where passengers on the Melbourne-Sydney journey changed trains until 1962, when a standard gauge track was opened between the two capitals. After World War II, in an attempt to overcome the difference in gauges and speed up traffic, a [[bogie exchange]] device lifted freight wagons and carriages allowing workers to refit rolling stock with different gauged wheel-sets.\n\nThe break of railway gauge at Albury was a major impediment to Australia's war effort and infrastructure during both World Wars, as every soldier, every item of equipment, and all supplies had to be off-loaded from the broad gauge and reloaded onto a standard gauge railway wagon on the opposite side of the platform. In his book ''Tramps Abroad'', writer [[Mark Twain]] spoke of the break of gauge at Albury and changing trains: \"Now comes a singular thing, the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the unaccountable marvel that Australia can show, namely the break of gauge at Albury.

Other large employers are: The Commercial Club Albury and [[Hume Bank]].\n\nOne of Albury's major employers was DSI Holdings. Originally the Kaitlers Road facility was opened as an expansion for [[Borg-Warner]] in 1971, manufacturing gearboxes for various manufacturers including [[Ford]], [[Holden]] and even [[Maserati]]. At its peak in 1982 it employed 1251 people. The ownership of the plant changed several times - it was sold in 1987 to [[BTR Nylex]].
