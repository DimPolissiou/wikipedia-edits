One of Poke's first actions was to assist in gaining the support of [[Neville Blond]].  Blond was an influential industrialist and a skilled financial advisor. In 1954 Poke and Duncan outlined the ESC's vision to Blond, who agreed that he would support them when the company had acquired a theatre. Poke carried out negotiations to purchase Alfred Esdaile's rundown [[Kingsway Theatre]]. This needed extensive refurbishment, so the company decided to lease the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (RCT) from Esdaile. Nevertheless Blond joined the group and was its first ESC chairman from 1954 to 1970.<ref name=\"The Making of Theatrical Reputations: Studies from the Modern London Theatre\"/><ref name=\"The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage\"/>\n\nPoke was on the finance subcommittee and helped managed the company\u2019s accounts. He also contributed his opinions about the theatre's artistic direction. The ESC\u2019s Artistic Director from 1956\u201365, was Devine.  Poke disagreed with him several times over the artistic control of the theatre and the choice of production. Poke's taste was, on the whole, for traditional English drama.  Hence he voiced his concerns about the left-wing politics evident in many plays staged by the ESC and what he thought was their pessimistic tone.<ref name=\"The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage\"/>\n\n===Censorship===\n\nIn early 1966 the ESC was prosecuted for their production of Edward Bond\u2019s \u2018''Saved''\u2019 staged in December 1965. The company had claimed that it was being run as a private club, and was therefore exempt from the [[Theatres Act 1843|Theatres Act]] of 1843. Poke, the secretary, William Gaskill, the director and Esdaile, the licensee, were summoned to a hearing at Marlborough Magistrates Court to represent the ESC. The Lord Chamberlain had denied '''Saved''' a licence unless two scenes were cut, including one in which a baby is stoned to death on stage. The Director of Public Prosecutions made eighteen summonses against the ESC prompted by the Chamberlain.<ref name=\"The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage\"/><ref name=\"Banned!\">{{cite book|last1=Findlater|first1=Richard|title=Banned! A review of theatrical censorship in Britain|date=1967|publisher=MacGibbon and Kee|isbn=090639922X|pages=171-172}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1966 when the hearing resumed Poke, Gaskill and Esdaile pleaded not guilty. The court ruled that the performance violated the Theatres Act as the RCT was open several nights a week as a public theatre and was not just a private club. The ESC was fined \u00a350 which was a token amount for a technical offence. The case of '''Saved''' contributed to the repeal of [[Theatres Act 1843|Theatres Act]] in 1968.  This liberated theatres from censorship.<ref name=\"The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage\"/><ref name=\"Banned!\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Lord Chamberlain banned the ESC's performance of Bond's play '''Early Morning'''. To avoid prosecution, Poke proposed that the company stage the play as a dress rehearsal without a ticket charge. This idea was successful.  Soon the [[Theatres Act 1968|1968 Theatres Bill]] followed, which abolishing the censorship of plays by the Lord Chamberlain.<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\"/><ref name=\"The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage\"/>\n\n===Press Controversy===\n\nIn 1969 the ESC became involved in a controversy involving critics in the press, and Poke advised the Company on how to handle the situation. The directors regarded [[Hilary Spurling]], a drama critic working for ''[[The Spectator]]'', as disruptive so refused to give her tickets to their production of '''The Contractor'''. As an ex-journalist, he was reluctant to curtail the freedom of the press and was the only person within the ESC to oppose the decision to exclude Spurling.<ref name=\"Greville Poke obituary\">{{cite web|last1=Shorter|first1=Eric|title=Greville Poke obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/03/guardianobituaries2|website=The Guardian|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> He warned the ESC that the [[Arts Council]] would protest against the action and might threaten to stop funding the company. Poke was correct: the Arts Council stated its objections and newspaper drama critics boycotted Royal Court performances. Backtracking the directors admitted that they should have taken Poke\u2019s advice and reinstated the company\u2019s policy of inviting the press to productions.<ref name=\"The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage\"/>\n\n===Chairman===\n\nIn 1970 Poke refused the offer of the Chairmanship of the ESC, but accepted when offered the position in 1973.

He was chairman of the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] and [[Thorndike Theatre]], Leatherhead.

He provided significant finance by way of bank guarantees that enabled the then manager, [[Larry Lloyd]], to sign a number of players, not the least of which was [[Eamonn O'Keefe]] from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a365,000. The Latics duly gained promotion under Lloyd to the Third Division in May 1982.\n\n===Chelsea F.C.===\nLater in 1982, Bates purchased [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for \u00a31. When he purchased the club they were in serious financial trouble, as well as being tarnished by a notorious [[Football hooliganism|hooligan]] element among their support. They were also struggling in the [[Football League Second Division]], a stark contrast to their successful era from 1955 to 1971, when they had won a [[Football League First Division]] title, an [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup]] and [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. After narrowly escaping relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383]] season, Bates made the funds available to manager [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]] to sign players including [[Kerry Dixon]], [[David Speedie]], [[Pat Nevin]], [[Mickey Thomas (footballer)|Mickey Thomas]], [[Eddie Niedzwiecki]] and [[Nigel Spackman]], who helped the club win promotion and re-establish themselves in the top-flight with consecutive top six finishes.\n\nChelsea have spent all but one season in the top flight of English football since 1984, and by the time Bates stepped down as chairman in 2003 they were firmly re-established as one of English football's leading sides, having achieved seven successive top six finishes in the [[Premier League]] and won several major trophies as well as signing a succession of high-profile players, including many foreign international stars.\n\nIn the early years, he fought a successful and long-running legal battle with [[Real estate developer|property developers]], Marler Estates, who had purchased a substantial portion of the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], Chelsea's home ground. He re-united the freehold with the club (and thus secured its future) after Marler's bankruptcy following a market crash, which allowed him to do a deal with their banks and create the [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], an organisation set-up to stave off future developers and attempted to make the club more financially viable. He also had Stamford Bridge rebuilt as an all-seater stadium by 1995, and by 2001 it had a capacity of more than 42,000.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he famously erected an electric perimeter fence around the pitch at Stamford Bridge to prevent pitch invasions, but the fence was soon dismantled after the local council refused him permission to turn the electricity on.\n\nBates spent 21 years at Chelsea, during which time he attracted the headlines on many occasions (many times with the controversial headlines that the club could have done without) and employed no fewer than nine managers.<ref>{{cite news |\ndate=13 February 1998 |\nurl=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/02/13/sfnche13.html |\ntitle=Gullit consigned to history |\nwork=The Daily Telegraph |\naccessdate=5 February 2007 |\nlocation=London| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103010101/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html%3D/archive/1998/02/13/sfnche13.html| url-status=dead |archivedate=3 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |\ndate=12 September 2000 |\nurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/922110.stm |\ntitle=Vialli sacked as Chelsea boss |\npublisher=BBC |\naccessdate=5 February 2007 }}</ref> His match-day programme notes, in which he often attacked various individuals, were also controversial.

The dispute was ultimately ended by Harding's death in a [[helicopter]] crash in October 1996. Bates sparked further controversy the following year when he said of Harding, \"I don't believe evil should triumph and he was an evil man ... This is a much happier ship at Chelsea now he's no longer around\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bates: Harding Was Evil |date=20 October 1997 |author=Harry Harris  |work=Daily Record |location=Glasgow}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of his chairmanship, Stamford Bridge had been substantially refurbished and modernised, while he had become (at the time) Chelsea's most successful chairman. The club had won several major trophies and were consistently finishing in the top six of the Premier League, even finishing third and just four points behind champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1999, as well as qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] with a top-class playing squad containing [[Gianfranco Zola]], [[Roberto Di Matteo]], [[Graeme Le Saux]], [[Marcel Desailly]] and [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]]. However, its future was threatened by an estimated debt burden of \u00a380&nbsp;million, yet it was secured against the club's ground, Stamford Bridge. In 2003, he sold the club to Russian oil billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] for a sum of \u00a3140&nbsp;million, making a \u00a317&nbsp;million profit. Bruce Buck, the current chairman, was in charge of the club's sale to Roman Abramovich. After the takeover, Bates was investigated by the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) for allegedly owning undeclared shares in Chelsea Village plc, but the case was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,5339498-103,00.html |title=How watchdog inquiry left Bates unruffled |accessdate=25 August 2006 |date=25 November 2005 |author=David Conn |work=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103093202/http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,5339498-103,00.html |archive-date=3 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He stayed on as club chairman until March 2004, when he announced his resignation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3526961.stm |title=Bates leaves Chelsea  |date=2 March 2004 |work=BBC Sport  }}</ref> Within a couple of weeks of his departure, he was back in the limelight as he wrote a one-off column in the [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] matchday programme, incidentally and somewhat ironically against Chelsea.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/11/newsstory.sport3 |title=Bolton sign up new columnist Bates  |date=11 March 2004 |work=The Guardian    }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Bates was criticised for his \"truly shameful\" comments about the alleged victims who were racially abused by their football coaches at Stamford Bridge.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/30/ken-bates-chelsea-racism-comments-accused-victims|title=Ken Bates accused of \u2018shameful\u2019 comments over Chelsea racism scandal|date=30 May 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 February 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n====Partick Thistle====\nIn June 1986, Bates purchased a controlling interest in Scottish club [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] for around \u00a3100,000 via a share issue after being made aware of their financial problems by their chairman Miller Reid, who was an acquaintance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/Ken+Bates+Arrives+1986|title=Chelsea chief in Firhill swoop|author=Jim Blair|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|year=1986|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1987+-+Ken+Bates+Article|title=Ken Bates|work=Jagazine|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|year=1987|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> Bates installed veteran former Chelsea player [[Derek Johnstone]] as manager with the intention of using Partick as a [[feeder club]] for Chelsea<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1987+Ken+Bates+Article|title=Man with a mission|author=Alex Cameron|work=Daily Record|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|year=1987|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> ([[Billy Dodds]] and [[Colin West (footballer, born 1967)|Colin West]] were loaned from the ''Blues'' to the ''Jags'', with [[John McNaught (footballer, born 1964)|John McNaught]] also linked to both clubs).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/partick-project-a-bridge-too-far-for-ken-1-516572|title=Partick project a bridge too far for Ken|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=6 March 2004|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> In April 1989, a group of local businessman including new chairman Jim Donald purchased Bates' shareholding in the [[Glasgow]] club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1989+-+Takeover|title=Thistle all Scottish again|author=Ian Paul|work=[[The Herald (Scotland)|Glasgow Herald]]|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|date=15 April 1989|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===FA and Wembley Stadium===\nBates was an active member of [[The Football Association]] (FA) executive and was involved in the early stages of the project to rebuild [[Wembley Stadium]] and was appointed chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd in 1997.

He was involved in forming the [[Premier League]], the development of [[Wembley Stadium]] and is the former owner and chairman of football clubs [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nBates spent five years as chairman of [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] during the 1960s and also had a spell at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. In 1982, he purchased [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for [[peppercorn (legal)|\u00a31]]. During his tenure, he helped the club win a long-running battle with property developers who were attempting to evict them from their [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] home. By the end of his reign, Chelsea were regularly finishing in the top six of the Premier League and had won their first major trophies since the 1970s, although they had a debt burden of around \u00a380&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/jesper-gronkjaer-the-winger-who-scored-chelseas-1bn-goal-2220694.html |title=Jesper Gronkjaer: The winger who scored Chelsea's \u00a31bn goal |accessdate=25 February 2011 |date=21 February 2011 |author=Mark Fleming |work=The Independent }}</ref> In July 2003, he sold the club to Russian billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] from whom he received approximately \u00a318&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2406994/Bates-sells-off-Chelsea-to-a-Russian-billionaire.html | title=Bates sells off Chelsea to a Russian billionaire | accessdate=21 March 2018 | date=2 July 2003 |author=Mihir Bose | work= The Telegrapgh}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2005, Bates bought a 50% stake in Leeds United, another club struggling under a heavy debt burden. In May 2007, Leeds entered administration, and were relegated to [[Football League One|League One]]. The Club regained [[Football League Championship|Championship]] status in 2010 and, in May 2011, it was confirmed that Bates had become the sole owner. In November 2012, Bates sold his holdings in Leeds United to [[Gulf Finance House|GFH Capital]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBates was born in Ealing in 1931. His mother died shortly afterwards and his father absconded, so he was raised by his grandparents in a council flat. He grew up supporting [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] but was unsuccessful in pursuing a playing career in football. He made his personal fortune in the [[Logistics|haulage]] industry and later moved into [[quarrying]], [[ready-mix concrete]] and dairy farming.\n\nBates was involved with various other enterprises during the 1960s and 1970s, including projects on the [[British Virgin Islands]] and in [[Rhodesia]]. The [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] fanzine Square Ball has published a photograph of Bates with Rhodesian PM [[Ian Smith]] during a 1967 tour by [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], when Rhodesia was subject to UN sanctions.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/51486514/Boundary-Bulletin-Vol1-27-Summer-Issue-2-July-67-Ken-Bates-Meets-Rhodesian-Prime-Minister-Ian-Smith Latics Meet a Prime Minister] Oldham Boundary Bulletin, linked to from [http://www.thesquareball.net/lwmyd/2011/10/28/1968-ken-bates-noel-lloyd-and-the-fate-of-a-caribbean-island/ 1968: Ken Bates, Noel Lloyd, and the Fate of a Caribbean Island] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026032908/http://www.thesquareball.net/lwmyd/2011/10/28/1968-ken-bates-noel-lloyd-and-the-fate-of-a-caribbean-island/ |date=26 October 2012 }}, Square Ball, By Moscowhite on 28 October 2011</ref> \n\n===British Virgin Islands===\nSquare Ball has reported, having worked with a documentary made in the British Virgin Islands,<ref>[http://bvinews.com/bvi/noel-lloyd-story-publish-in-uk-magazine/ Noel Lloyd story published in UK magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108023308/http://bvinews.com/bvi/noel-lloyd-story-publish-in-uk-magazine/ |date=8 November 2011 }}, BVI News, Japhix, 4 November 2011</ref> that Bates attempted to obtain control and develop most of the island of [[Anegada]] near [[Tortola]] on a 199-year lease, but was thwarted after protests by islanders caused the local government to change its decision and investigations began by the British government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitytalking.com/noel-lloyd-ken-bates-leeds-united/|title=POSITIVE ACTION MOVEMENT: When Ken Bates Took Over His Homeland in 1968, Noel Lloyd Led The Fight To Take It Back|publisher=Square Ball|author=Moscowhite|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> The original agreement to lease the island was known as the Bates-Hill Agreement.

He provided significant finance by way of bank guarantees that enabled the then manager, [[Larry Lloyd]], to sign a number of players, not the least of which was [[Eamonn O'Keefe]] from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a365,000. The Latics duly gained promotion under Lloyd to the Third Division in May 1982.\n\n===Chelsea F.C.===\nLater in 1982, Bates purchased [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for \u00a31. When he purchased the club they were in serious financial trouble, as well as being tarnished by a notorious [[Football hooliganism|hooligan]] element among their support. They were also struggling in the [[Football League Second Division]], a stark contrast to their successful era from 1955 to 1971, when they had won a [[Football League First Division]] title, an [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup]] and [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. After narrowly escaping relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383]] season, Bates made the funds available to manager [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]] to sign players including [[Kerry Dixon]], [[David Speedie]], [[Pat Nevin]], [[Mickey Thomas (footballer)|Mickey Thomas]], [[Eddie Niedzwiecki]] and [[Nigel Spackman]], who helped the club win promotion and re-establish themselves in the top-flight with consecutive top six finishes.\n\nChelsea have spent all but one season in the top flight of English football since 1984, and by the time Bates stepped down as chairman in 2003 they were firmly re-established as one of English football's leading sides, having achieved seven successive top six finishes in the [[Premier League]] and won several major trophies as well as signing a succession of high-profile players, including many foreign international stars.\n\nIn the early years, he fought a successful and long-running legal battle with [[Real estate developer|property developers]], Marler Estates, who had purchased a substantial portion of the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], Chelsea's home ground. He re-united the freehold with the club (and thus secured its future) after Marler's bankruptcy following a market crash, which allowed him to do a deal with their banks and create the [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], an organisation set-up to stave off future developers and attempted to make the club more financially viable. He also had Stamford Bridge rebuilt as an all-seater stadium by 1995, and by 2001 it had a capacity of more than 42,000.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he famously erected an electric perimeter fence around the pitch at Stamford Bridge to prevent pitch invasions, but the fence was soon dismantled after the local council refused him permission to turn the electricity on.\n\nBates spent 21 years at Chelsea, during which time he attracted the headlines on many occasions (many times with the controversial headlines that the club could have done without) and employed no fewer than nine managers.<ref>{{cite news |\ndate=13 February 1998 |\nurl=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/02/13/sfnche13.html |\ntitle=Gullit consigned to history |\nwork=The Daily Telegraph |\naccessdate=5 February 2007 |\nlocation=London| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103010101/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html%3D/archive/1998/02/13/sfnche13.html| url-status=dead |archivedate=3 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |\ndate=12 September 2000 |\nurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/922110.stm |\ntitle=Vialli sacked as Chelsea boss |\npublisher=BBC |\naccessdate=5 February 2007 }}</ref> His match-day programme notes, in which he often attacked various individuals, were also controversial.

The dispute was ultimately ended by Harding's death in a [[helicopter]] crash in October 1996. Bates sparked further controversy the following year when he said of Harding, \"I don't believe evil should triumph and he was an evil man ... This is a much happier ship at Chelsea now he's no longer around\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bates: Harding Was Evil |date=20 October 1997 |author=Harry Harris  |work=Daily Record |location=Glasgow}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of his chairmanship, Stamford Bridge had been substantially refurbished and modernised, while he had become (at the time) Chelsea's most successful chairman. The club had won several major trophies and were consistently finishing in the top six of the Premier League, even finishing third and just four points behind champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1999, as well as qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] with a top-class playing squad containing [[Gianfranco Zola]], [[Roberto Di Matteo]], [[Graeme Le Saux]], [[Marcel Desailly]] and [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]]. However, its future was threatened by an estimated debt burden of \u00a380&nbsp;million, yet it was secured against the club's ground, Stamford Bridge. In 2003, he sold the club to Russian oil billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] for a sum of \u00a3140&nbsp;million, making a \u00a317&nbsp;million profit. Bruce Buck, the current chairman, was in charge of the club's sale to Roman Abramovich. After the takeover, Bates was investigated by the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) for allegedly owning undeclared shares in Chelsea Village plc, but the case was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,5339498-103,00.html |title=How watchdog inquiry left Bates unruffled |accessdate=25 August 2006 |date=25 November 2005 |author=David Conn |work=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103093202/http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,5339498-103,00.html |archive-date=3 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He stayed on as club chairman until March 2004, when he announced his resignation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3526961.stm |title=Bates leaves Chelsea  |date=2 March 2004 |work=BBC Sport  }}</ref> Within a couple of weeks of his departure, he was back in the limelight as he wrote a one-off column in the [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] matchday programme, incidentally and somewhat ironically against Chelsea.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/11/newsstory.sport3 |title=Bolton sign up new columnist Bates  |date=11 March 2004 |work=The Guardian    }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Bates was criticised for his \"truly shameful\" comments about the alleged victims who were racially abused by their football coaches at Stamford Bridge.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/30/ken-bates-chelsea-racism-comments-accused-victims|title=Ken Bates accused of \u2018shameful\u2019 comments over Chelsea racism scandal|date=2018-05-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n====Partick Thistle====\nIn June 1986, Bates purchased a controlling interest in Scottish club [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] for around \u00a3100,000 via a share issue after being made aware of their financial problems by their chairman Miller Reid, who was an acquaintance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/Ken+Bates+Arrives+1986|title=Chelsea chief in Firhill swoop|author=Jim Blair|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|year=1986|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1987+-+Ken+Bates+Article|title=Ken Bates|work=Jagazine|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|year=1987|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> Bates installed veteran former Chelsea player [[Derek Johnstone]] as manager with the intention of using Partick as a [[feeder club]] for Chelsea<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1987+Ken+Bates+Article|title=Man with a mission|author=Alex Cameron|work=Daily Record|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|year=1987|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> ([[Billy Dodds]] and [[Colin West (footballer, born 1967)|Colin West]] were loaned from the ''Blues'' to the ''Jags'', with [[John McNaught (footballer, born 1964)|John McNaught]] also linked to both clubs).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/partick-project-a-bridge-too-far-for-ken-1-516572|title=Partick project a bridge too far for Ken|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=6 March 2004|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> In April 1989, a group of local businessman including new chairman Jim Donald purchased Bates' shareholding in the [[Glasgow]] club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1989+-+Takeover|title=Thistle all Scottish again|author=Ian Paul|work=[[The Herald (Scotland)|Glasgow Herald]]|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|date=15 April 1989|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===FA and Wembley Stadium===\nBates was an active member of [[The Football Association]] (FA) executive and was involved in the early stages of the project to rebuild [[Wembley Stadium]] and was appointed chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd in 1997.

The latter sense is now mainly historical,<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd Edition (1989)</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo-Indian Anglo-Indian], [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]].</ref> but confusions can arise. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', for example, gives ''three'' possibilities: \"Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain or (chiefly historical) of English descent or birth but living or having lived long in India\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web|title=Anglo-Indian|work=Oxford Dictionary Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Anglo-Indian|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref> People fitting the middle definition are more usually known as [[British Asian]] or [[British Indian]]. This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct [[minority group|minority community]] of mixed [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] ancestry, whose native language is [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the [[British Raj|centuries that Britain was in India]], the children born to unions between British men and Indian women (and vice versa) began to form a new community.  These Anglo-Indians formed a small but significant portion of the population during the [[British Raj]], and were well represented in certain administrative roles.  The documented Anglo-Indian population dwindled from roughly two million [[Indian Independence Act 1947|at the time of independence in 1947]] to 300,000 - 1,000,000 by 2010. The nature of British-Indian relationships and stigma during the colonial period often meant that many Anglo-Indians were undocumented or incorrectly racially identified during the British Raj. Many have adapted to local communities in India or emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States and New Zealand where they are part of the larger [[Indian diaspora]].<ref name=\"Fisher, Michael H. 2007\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Some corner of a foreign field |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17312300 |newspaper=The Economist |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119140656/http://www.economist.com/node/17312300| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> \n\nThis process was replicated in many other meetings of European men (traders, soldiers, administrators, infrastructure builders, and so on) with women across the subcontinent, creating the [[Anglo-Burmese people]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and the [[Burgher people]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Anglo-Indian gathering.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Indian gathering.|alt=]]\nThe first use of \"Anglo-Indian\" was to describe all [[British people]] living in India.

The board of directors wrote in 1688 to its Council at [[Fort St. George]]: \"Induce by all meanes you can invent our souldiers (sic) to marry with Native women, because it will be impossible to get ordinary young women, as we have before directed, to pay their own passages although Gentlewomen sufficient do offer themselves.\" Until 1741, a special payment was made to each soldier who had his child baptised as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women there the children would be brought up as [[Roman Catholics]] rather than Protestants. The Company's officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married \"to prevent wickedness\". Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.\n\nThe British military population in India,  grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. In practice, only a small minority of British residents married whilst in India, and the poorer they were the less likely they were to marry. It seems that in Bengal between 1757 and 1800 only one in four British covenanted civil servants, one in eight civilian residents, and one in ten army officers married there. Amongst military other ranks the proportion was between one in fifteen and one in forty-five. Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's, Calcutta]] between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. Genteel British women were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from [[Cawnpore]]: \"Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on [[Ludgate Hill]] and some even from [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane|Old Drury]] [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.\" \n\nThe reforming zeal of Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their Royal counterparts and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12-17 years in the Royal Army; and in the [[Bengal]] Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately \u00a350 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with \u00a3600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780-85 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at [[Berhampore]], a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies' seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be 'finished'; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |page=3-11 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nOriginally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of [[Islamic law]] outside [[Calcutta]], and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like [[Mary Sherwood]] routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the British father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the British elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |page=15-19 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref> \n\nIn 1821, a pamphlet entitled \"Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons\" by a \"Practical Reformer,\" was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled \"An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons.\" Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the \"East Indian Committee\" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. [[John William Ricketts]], a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of [[Madras]], he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.<ref name=autogenerated3/>\n\nAs British women began arriving in India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of officers and soldiers, British men became less likely to marry Indian women.

For example, in the music industry there are [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] (born [[Madras]]), [[Peter Sarstedt]] ([[Delhi]]) and [[Cliff Richard]] ([[Lucknow]]). The looser definition of Anglo-Indian (any mixed British-Indian parentage) encompasses the likes of cricketer [[Nasser Hussain]], footballer [[Michael Chopra]] and actor [[Ben Kingsley]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20857969 |title=Anglo-Indians: Is their culture dying out? |first=Kris |last=Griffiths |work=BBC News |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnglo-Indians distinguished themselves in the [[Military of India|military]]. [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Maurice Barker]] was India's first Anglo-Indian Air Marshal. At least seven other Anglo-Indians subsequently reached that post, a notable achievement for a small community. A number of others have been decorated for military achievements.

The second most respected matriculation qualification in India, the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]], was started and built by some of the community's best known educationalists, including [[Frank Anthony]], who served as its president, and [[A.E.T. Barrow]], its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.\n\nIn sporting circles Anglo-Indians have made a significant contribution, particularly at Olympic level where [[Norman Pritchard]] became India's first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the [[1900 Olympic Games]] in Paris, France. In [[cricket]] [[Roger Binny]] was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]] triumph. [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]] was India's first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.\n\nSeveral charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India.

The latter sense is now mainly historical,<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd Edition (1989)</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo-Indian Anglo-Indian], [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]].</ref> but confusions can arise. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', for example, gives ''three'' possibilities: \"Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain or (chiefly historical) of English descent or birth but living or having lived long in India\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web|title=Anglo-Indian|work=Oxford Dictionary Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Anglo-Indian|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref> People fitting the middle definition are more usually known as [[British Asian]] or [[British Indian]]. This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct [[minority group|minority community]] of mixed [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] ancestry, whose native language is [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the [[British Raj|centuries that Britain was in India]], the children born to unions between British men and Indian women (and vice versa) began to form a new community.  These Anglo-Indians formed a small but significant portion of the population during the [[British Raj]], and were well represented in certain administrative roles.  The documented Anglo-Indian population dwindled from roughly two million [[Indian Independence Act 1947|at the time of independence in 1947]] to 300,000 - 1,000,000 by 2010. The nature of British-Indian relationships and stigma during the colonial period often meant that many Anglo-Indians were undocumented or incorrectly racially identified during the British Raj. Many have adapted to local communities in India or emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States and New Zealand where they are part of the larger [[Indian diaspora]].<ref name=\"Fisher, Michael H. 2007\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Some corner of a foreign field |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17312300 |newspaper=The Economist |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119140656/http://www.economist.com/node/17312300| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> \n\nThis process was replicated in many other meetings of European men (traders, soldiers, administrators, infrastructure builders, and so on) with women across the subcontinent, creating the [[Anglo-Burmese people]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and the [[Burgher people]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Anglo-Indian gathering.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Indian gathering.|alt=]]\nThe first use of \"Anglo-Indian\" was to describe all [[British people]] living in India.

The board of directors wrote in 1688 to its Council at [[Fort St. George]]: \"Induce by all meanes you can invent our souldiers (sic) to marry with Native women, because it will be impossible to get ordinary young women, as we have before directed, to pay their own passages although Gentlewomen sufficient do offer themselves.\" Until 1741, a special payment was made to each soldier who had his child baptised as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women there the children would be brought up as [[Roman Catholics]] rather than Protestants. The Company's officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married \"to prevent wickedness\". Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.\n\nThe British military population in India grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. In practice, only a small minority of British residents married whilst in India, and the poorer they were the less likely they were to marry. It seems that in Bengal between 1757 and 1800 only one in four British covenanted civil servants, one in eight civilian residents, and one in ten army officers married there. Amongst military other ranks the proportion was between one in fifteen and one in forty-five. Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's, Calcutta]] between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. Genteel British women were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from [[Cawnpore]]: \"Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on [[Ludgate Hill]] and some even from [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane|Old Drury]] [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.\" \n\nThe reforming zeal of Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their Royal counterparts and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12-17 years in the Royal Army; and in the [[Bengal]] Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately \u00a350 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with \u00a3600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780-85 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at [[Berhampore]], a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies' seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be 'finished'; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |page=3-11 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nOriginally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of [[Islamic law]] outside [[Calcutta]], and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like [[Mary Sherwood]] routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the British father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the British elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |page=15-19 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref> \n\nIn 1821, a pamphlet entitled \"Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons\" by a \"Practical Reformer,\" was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled \"An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons.\" Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the \"East Indian Committee\" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. [[John William Ricketts]], a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of [[Madras]], he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.<ref name=autogenerated3/>\n\nAs British women began arriving in India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of officers and soldiers, British men became less likely to marry Indian women.

(''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' touches on the identity crisis faced by the Anglo-Indian community during the independence struggle.) They felt insecure in an India that put a premium on participation in the independence movement as a prerequisite for important government positions.\n\nMany Anglo-Indians left the country in 1947, hoping to make a new life in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], such as Australia or Canada. The exodus continued through the 1950s and 1960s and by the late 1990s most had left with many of the remaining Anglo-Indians still aspiring to leave.<ref>Anthony, Frank.

''The Leopard's Call: An Anglo-Indian Love Story'' (2005) by Reginald Shires, tells of the life of two teachers at the small Bengali town of [[Falakata]], down from [[Bhutan]]; ''At the Age for Love: A Novel of Bangalore during World War II'' (2006) is by the same author.

For example, in the music industry there are [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] (born [[Madras]]), [[Peter Sarstedt]] ([[Delhi]]) and [[Cliff Richard]] ([[Lucknow]]).

The second most respected matriculation qualification in India, the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]], was started and built by some of the community's best known educationalists, including [[Frank Anthony]], who served as its president, and [[A.E.T. Barrow]], its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.\n\nIn sporting circles Anglo-Indians have made a significant contribution, particularly at Olympic level where [[Norman Pritchard]] became India's first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the [[1900 Olympic Games]] in Paris, France. In [[cricket]] [[Roger Binny]] was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]] triumph. [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]] was India's first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.\n\nSeveral charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India.

In practice for retail price indices, the \"basket of goods\" is updated incrementally every few years to reflect changes.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that many economic indices taken over the long term are not really like-for-like comparisons and this is an issue taken into account by researchers in [[economic history]].\n\n==Indices==\n\nProvider: '''[[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]]'''\n* [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]\n\nProvider: '''[[Standard & Poor's]]'''\n* [[S&P 500]]\n* [[S&P 400]]\n* [[S&P 600]]\n* [[S&P 1500]]\n* [[S&P/ASX 200]]\n* [[S&P/TSX Composite Index]]\n* [[S&P Global 1200]]\n* S&P Custom Group of indices\n* [[S&P Leveraged Loan Index]]\n* [[Case\u2013Shiller index]]\n\nProvider: '''[[Russell Investments]]'''\n* [[Russell 1000 Index]]\n* [[Russell 2000 Index]]\n* [[Russell 3000 Index]]\n* [[Russell Midcap Index]]\n* Russell Microcap Index\n* Russell Global Index\n* Russell Developed Index\n* Russell Europe Index\n* Russell Asia Pacific Index\n* Russell Emerging Markets Index\nProvider: [[FTSE Group]]\n* [[FTSE 100 Index]]\n* [[FTSE 250 Index]]\n* [[FTSE 350 Index]]\n* [[FTSE AIM UK 50 Index]]\n* [[FTSE All-Share Index]]\n* [[FTSE/Athex Large Cap]]\n* [[FTSE Bursa Malaysia Index]]\n* [[FTSE Fledgling Index]]\n* [[FTSE Italia Mid Cap]]\n* [[FTSE MIB]]\n* [[FTSE SmallCap Index]]\n* [[FTSE techMARK 100]]\n* [[FTSE4Good Index]]\n* [[FTSEurofirst 300 Index]]\nProvider: [[STOXX|STOXX Limited]]\n* [[Euro Stoxx 50|EURO STOXX 50]]\n* [[STOXX Europe 50]]\n* [[STOXX Europe 600]]\n* STOXX Global 1800\nProvider: '''[[MSCI|Morgan Stanley Capital International]]'''\n* [[MSCI World| MSCI World Index]]\n* [[MSCI EAFE| MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index]]\n\nProvider: '''[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]'''\n* [[BSE Sensex|BSE SENSEX]]\nProvider: '''[[Reuters]]'''\n* [[Reuters-CRB Index|Reuters-CRB Commodities Index]]\n\nProvider: '''[[Markit Group Limited|Markit]]'''\n* [[asset-backed securities index|ABX]]\n* [[credit default swap index|CDX]] / [[iTraxx]]\n* CMBX\n\nProvider: '''[[Historic Automobile Group]]'''\n* HAGI Top Index\n\nProvider: '''CRYX'''\n* [[Cryptocurrency | CRYX5]]\n* [[Cryptocurrency | CRYX10]]\n* [[Cryptocurrency | CRYX25]]\n* [[Cryptocurrency | CRYX50]]\n* [[Cryptocurrency | CRYX100]]\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Stock market index]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Producer price index]]\n* [[Price index]]\n* [[Chemical plant cost indexes]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]\n* [[Dow Jones Indexes]]\n* [[Indexation]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Robin Marris, ''Economic Arithmetic,'' (1958).\n\n==External links==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[http://www.humboldt.edu/~indexhum/ Humboldt Economic Index]\n*[http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.category/indices/2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.html?lid=us_topnav_indicies S&P Indices]\n*[http://www.kroijer.com www.kroijer.com]\n{{col-2}}\n*[http://www.sgindex.com/ SG Index]\n*[http://www.djindexes.com/ Dow Jones Indexes]\n{{col-end}}\n\n{{economics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Index (Economics)}}\n[[Category:Business terms]]\n[[Category:Economic growth]]\n[[Category:Index numbers| ]]\n[[Category:Economic indicators]]\n[[Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)]]\n", "name_user": "Xindeho", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}

{"title_page": "History of education in Canada", "text_new": "[[Image:Robert Harris - A Meeting of the School Trustees.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian education pioneer [[Kate Henderson]] is portrayed in ''A Meeting of the School Trustees'' by painter Robert Harris (1885)]]\nThe '''history of education in Canada''' covers schooling from elementary through university, plus the ideas of educators, plus the policies of national and provincial governments. In 1957, Charles Phillips divided the history of public schooling in Canada into four periods or stages:\n:The first was characterized by church-controlled education and lasted from the early 1700s through to the mid 1800s. Stage two, which extended to the late 1800s, saw the introduction of more centralized authority, universal free education, and taxation for schooling at the local level. Stage three, the early 1900s, saw the development of provincial departments of education, a more consistent curriculum, better trained teachers and the start of provincial government financial support for schools. The fourth stage, since the Second World War, has been characterized by the appointment of Ministers of Education in each provincial government and a far greater involvement of government in all aspects of education.<ref>Brenda B. MacKay and Michael W. Firmin, \"The Historical Development of Private Education in Canada\"  ''Educational Research & Perspectives'' (2008) p 68, citing Charles Phillips, ''The development of education in Canada'' (1957).</ref>\n \nFor the current situation, see [[Education in Canada]]. For the First Nations history, see [[Canadian Indian residential school system]].\n\n==Religious schools==\nThe first schools in [[New France]] were operated by the Catholic church (as indeed were schools in France itself). In the early nineteenth century the colonial governments moved to set up publicly funded education systems. Protestants and Catholics were deeply divided over how religious and moral education should be delivered. In Upper Canada the Catholic minority rejected the Protestant practice of Biblical study in schools, while in Lower Canada the Protestant minority objected to the education system instilling Roman Catholic dogma. Thus in both these areas two schools systems were established, a Catholic and a Protestant.\n\nThe first organizational outline for education in Canada was written by Egerton Ryerson in the year 1847. His aim was to promote British culture in Upper Canada, as well as preserve it in light of its powerful neighbours. He did this in a report titled ''Report on a system of public elementary instruction for Upper Canada'' <ref>{{Cite book|last=Canada. Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/932849883|title=An act for amending the Common school act of Upper Canada; and an act for the better establishment and maintenance of common schools in Upper Canada.|date=1847|publisher=Derbishire|oclc=932849883}}</ref>\n\nUpon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] these schools systems were enshrined in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act (BNA), 1867]].  Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time.\n\nBritish Columbia established a non-sectarian school system in 1872.\n\nIn the three Maritime provinces, schools were mainly Protestant, and a single Protestant oriented school system was established in each of them. In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] there was not only the Catholic/Protestant split, but also deep divisions between Protestant sects, and nine separate schools systems were set up, one catering to each major denomination. Eventually the major Protestant boards merged into an integrated school system.\n\nOver time, the originally Protestant school boards of English Canada, known as the public schools, became increasingly secularized as Canadians came to believe in the [[separation of Church and state]], and the main boards became secular ones. In Ontario all overt religiosity was removed from the public school system in 1990. In two provinces the sectarian education systems have recently been eliminated through constitutional change. Newfoundland and Labrador eliminated its tri-denominational Catholic-Protestant-Pentecostal system after two referendums. In Quebec the Catholic/Protestant divide was replaced with a French language/English language one.\n\nReligious colleges are attached to numerous universities.<ref>Laurence K. Shook, ''Catholic Post-Secondary Education in English-Speaking Canada: A History'' (University of Toronto Press, 1971).</ref>\n\n===Language war and school crisis in Ontario===\n{{main|Regulation 17}}\nIn Ontario in 1912, the Conservative government of Sir [[James P. Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority.<ref>Robert Craig Brown,  and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896-1921: A nation transformed'' (1974) pp 253-62</ref><ref>Chad Gaffield, ''Language, Schooling, and Cultural Conflict: The Origins of the French Language Controversy in Ontario'' (1987)</ref> French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and then only English was allowed.

It was one of the key reasons the Francophones turned away from the war effort in 1915 and refused to enlist. Ontario's Catholics were led by the Irish, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools.<ref>Jack Cecillon, \"Turbulent Times in the Diocese of London: Bishop Fallon and the French-Language Controversy, 1910-18,\" ''Ontario History,'' Dec 1995, Vol. 87 Issue 4, pp 369-395</ref>\n\nRegulation 17 was eventually repealed in 1927.<ref>Marilyn Barber, \"The Ontario Bilingual Schools Issue: Sources of Conflict,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (1966) 47#3 , pp 227-248</ref><ref>Jack D.

It demonstrated the deep divergence of cultural, religious and language values and became an issue of national importance. The Catholic Franco-Manitobains had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, such that their children would be taught in French. However a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools.<ref name=\"language\">{{vcite journal|author=Fletcher, Robert|date=1949|title=The Language Problem in Manitoba's Schools|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=6|}}</ref> The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=McLauchlin, Kenneth|date=1986|title=\"Riding The Protestant Horse\": The Manitoba School Question and Canadian Politics, 1890\u20131896|journal=Historical Studies|publisher=CCHA|volume=53|pages=39\u201352}}</ref>  The federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]], who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights.<ref name=\"language\" /> The Manitoba Schools issue became an issue in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|Canadian federal election of 1896]], where it worked against the Conservatives and helped elect the Liberals.<ref>Paul Crunican, ''Priests and Politicians: Manitoba Schools and the Election of 1896'' (1975)</ref> As Prime Minister, Laurier implemented a compromise stating that Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.<ref name=\"language\" />\n\n===Alberta===\nThe Catholic archbishop of Edmonton, Henry Joseph O'Leary had a considerable impact on the city's Catholic sectors, and his efforts reflect many of the challenges facing the Catholic Church at that time. During the 1920s, O'Leary favored his fellow Irish and drastically reduced the influence of French Catholic clergy in his archdiocese and replaced them with Anglophone priests. He helped to assimilate Ukrainian Catholic immigrants into the stricter Roman Catholic traditions, extended the viability of Edmonton's separate Catholic school system, and established both a Catholic college at the University of Alberta and a seminary in Edmonton.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=McGuigan |title=Edmonton, Archbishop Henry O'Leary and the Roaring Twenties |work=Alberta History |date=1996 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pp=6\u201314}}</ref>\n\nIn 1892 Alberta adopted the Ontario schools model, emphasizing state-run institutions that stressed the English language, English history and English customs. The Catholic community, under the control of Irish, joined the British Protestant community in these new policies, despite the complaints of the French-Canadian minority. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Fran\u00e7aise de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their own cultural agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908\u201335; the majority of those hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Yvette T. M. |last=Mah\u00e9 |title=Bilingual School District Trustees and Cultural Transmission: The Alberta Experience, 1892-1939 |work=Historical Studies in Education |date=1997 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pp=65\u201382 |issn=0843-5057 |url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/download/1435/1559}}</ref>\n\n===Canadianization of immigrants===\nAfter 1870 numerous non-Anglophone immigrants arrived from Europe, including Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians and many others. Large numbers headed to the attractive free farms in the Prairie Provinces. Education was a central factor in their assimilation into Canadian culture and society.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Manfred |last=Prokop |title=Canadianization of Immigrant Children: Role of the Rural Elementary School in Alberta, 1900-1930 |work=Alberta History |year=1989 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=1\u201310 |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/9021.37.2/3.html}}</ref> An important indicator of assimilation was the use of English; the children of all immigrant groups showed a strong preference in favour of speaking English, regardless of their parents' language. From 1900 to 1930, the governments of the Prairie Provinces faced the formidable task of transforming the ethnically and linguistically diverse immigrant population into loyal and true Canadians. Many officials believed language assimilation by children would be the key to Canadianization.  However, there was opposition to the direct method of English teaching from some immigrant spokesmen. English-language usage in playground games often proved an effective device, and was systematically  used. The elementary schools especially in rural Alberta played a central role in the acculturation of the immigrants and their children, providing, according to Prokop, a community character that created a distinctive feature of Canadian schools glaringly missing in the European school tradition.\n\n==Academic versus vocational education==\nHistoric educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States,  have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines. In 1960, for example 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States.  Furthermore, the United States has long led in vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion.<ref>Seymour Martin Lipset, '' Revolution and Counterrevolution: Change and persistence in social structures'' (2nd ed, 1970) pp 40-41</ref>  According to research by Lawrence Downey:\n: Canadians, as a group, assigned considerably higher priority than did Americans to knowledge, scholarly attitudes, creative skills, aesthetic appreciation, and morality , as outcomes of schooling. Americans emphasized physical development, citizenship, patriotism, social skills, and family living much more than did Canadians.<ref>Lawrence William Downey, ''The task of public education: The perceptions of people'' (Midwest Administration Center, University of Chicago, 1960), Quoted in Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution'' p 42.</ref>\n\nIvor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era,  a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The  London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.<ref>Ivor F.

They had low wages and poor working conditions. Their salaries ranged from 400-1400 for women, or 600-2100 for men. Accounting for inflation, that would be approximately $8000 for women, or $10,000 for men by today's standards. Along with the low wages, the teachers would be responsible for everything in the school. This included janitorial duties, and administrative tasks on top of teaching the students.<ref name=\":0\" /> This made teaching a quite difficult and unappealing job. The first union for teachers was created in 1920, The Canadian Teachers Confederation (CTF). This allowed for teachers to unify with each other, as well as advocate for increased workplace rights.\n\n==Notes==\n<References/>\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Further|Bibliography of Canadian history#Education}}\n* Axelrod, Paul.

In 1957, Charles Phillips divided the history of public schooling in Canada into four periods or stages:\n:The first was characterized by church-controlled education and lasted from the early 1700s through to the mid 1800s. Stage two, which extended to the late 1800s, saw the introduction of more centralized authority, universal free education, and taxation for schooling at the local level. Stage three, the early 1900s, saw the development of provincial departments of education, a more consistent curriculum, better trained teachers and the start of provincial government financial support for schools. The fourth stage, since the Second World War, has been characterized by the appointment of Ministers of Education in each provincial government and a far greater involvement of government in all aspects of education.<ref>Brenda B. MacKay and Michael W. Firmin, \"The Historical Development of Private Education in Canada\"  ''Educational Research & Perspectives'' (2008) p 68, citing Charles Phillips, ''The development of education in Canada'' (1957).</ref>\n \nFor the current situation, see [[Education in Canada]]. For the First Nations history, see [[Canadian Indian residential school system]].\n\n<br />\n\n==Religious schools==\nThe first schools in [[New France]] were operated by the Catholic church (as indeed were schools in France itself). In the early nineteenth century the colonial governments moved to set up publicly funded education systems. Protestants and Catholics were deeply divided over how religious and moral education should be delivered. In Upper Canada the Catholic minority rejected the Protestant practice of Biblical study in schools, while in Lower Canada the Protestant minority objected to the education system instilling Roman Catholic dogma. Thus in both these areas two schools systems were established, a Catholic and a Protestant.\n\nThe first organizational outline for education in Canada was written by Egerton Ryerson in the year 1847. His aim was to promote british culture in Upper Canada, as well as preserve it in light of it's powerful neighbours. He did this in a report titled ''Report on a system of public elementary instruction for Upper Canada'' <ref>{{Cite book|last=Canada. Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/932849883|title=An act for amending the Common school act of Upper Canada; and an act for the better establishment and maintenance of common schools in Upper Canada.|date=1847|publisher=Derbishire|oclc=932849883}}</ref>\n\nUpon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] these schools systems were enshrined in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act (BNA), 1867]].  Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time.\n\nBritish Columbia established a non-sectarian school system in 1872.\n\nIn the three Maritime provinces, schools were mainly Protestant, and a single Protestant oriented school system was established in each of them. In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] there was not only the Catholic/Protestant split, but also deep divisions between Protestant sects, and nine separate schools systems were set up, one catering to each major denomination. Eventually the major Protestant boards merged into an integrated school system.\n\nOver time, the originally Protestant school boards of English Canada, known as the public schools, became increasingly secularized as Canadians came to believe in the [[separation of Church and state]], and the main boards became secular ones. In Ontario all overt religiosity was removed from the public school system in 1990. In two provinces the sectarian education systems have recently been eliminated through constitutional change. Newfoundland and Labrador eliminated its tri-denominational Catholic-Protestant-Pentecostal system after two referendums. In Quebec the Catholic/Protestant divide was replaced with a French language/English language one.\n\nReligious colleges are attached to numerous universities.<ref>Laurence K. Shook, ''Catholic Post-Secondary Education in English-Speaking Canada: A History'' (University of Toronto Press, 1971).</ref>\n\n===Language war and school crisis in Ontario===\n{{main|Regulation 17}}\nIn Ontario in 1912, the Conservative government of Sir [[James P. Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority.<ref>Robert Craig Brown,  and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896-1921: A nation transformed'' (1974) pp 253-62</ref><ref>Chad Gaffield, ''Language, Schooling, and Cultural Conflict: The Origins of the French Language Controversy in Ontario'' (1987)</ref> French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and then only English was allowed. Few of the teachers at these schools were fluent in English, so they had to shut down.\n\nFrench-Canadians\u2014growing rapidly in number in eastern Ontario because of migration,  reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the \"Prussians of Ontario\"\u2014a stinging rebuke since Canada was at war with Prussia and Germany at the time.  It was one of the key reasons the Francophones turned away from the war effort in 1915 and refused to enlist. Ontario's Catholics were led by the Irish, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools.<ref>Jack Cecillon, \"Turbulent Times in the Diocese of London: Bishop Fallon and the French-Language Controversy, 1910-18,\" ''Ontario History,'' Dec 1995, Vol. 87 Issue 4, pp 369-395</ref>\n\nRegulation 17 was eventually repealed in 1927.<ref>Marilyn Barber, \"The Ontario Bilingual Schools Issue: Sources of Conflict,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (1966) 47#3 , pp 227-248</ref><ref>Jack D.

It demonstrated the deep divergence of cultural, religious and language values and became an issue of national importance. The Catholic Franco-Manitobains had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, such that their children would be taught in French. However a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools.<ref name=\"language\">{{vcite journal|author=Fletcher, Robert|date=1949|title=The Language Problem in Manitoba's Schools|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=6|}}</ref> The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=McLauchlin, Kenneth|date=1986|title=\"Riding The Protestant Horse\": The Manitoba School Question and Canadian Politics, 1890\u20131896|journal=Historical Studies|publisher=CCHA|volume=53|pages=39\u201352}}</ref>  The federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]], who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights.<ref name=\"language\" /> The Manitoba Schools issue became an issue in the [[1896 Canadian federal election|Canadian federal election of 1896]], where it worked against the Conservatives and helped elect the Liberals.<ref>Paul Crunican, ''Priests and Politicians: Manitoba Schools and the Election of 1896'' (1975)</ref> As Prime Minister, Laurier implemented a compromise stating that Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.<ref name=\"language\" />\n\n===Alberta===\nThe Catholic archbishop of Edmonton, Henry Joseph O'Leary had a considerable impact on the city's Catholic sectors, and his efforts reflect many of the challenges facing the Catholic Church at that time. During the 1920s, O'Leary favored his fellow Irish and drastically reduced the influence of French Catholic clergy in his archdiocese and replaced them with Anglophone priests. He helped to assimilate Ukrainian Catholic immigrants into the stricter Roman Catholic traditions, extended the viability of Edmonton's separate Catholic school system, and established both a Catholic college at the University of Alberta and a seminary in Edmonton.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=McGuigan |title=Edmonton, Archbishop Henry O'Leary and the Roaring Twenties |work=Alberta History |date=1996 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pp=6\u201314}}</ref>\n\nIn 1892 Alberta adopted the Ontario schools model, emphasizing state-run institutions that stressed the English language, English history and English customs. The Catholic community, under the control of Irish, joined the British Protestant community in these new policies, despite the complaints of the French-Canadian minority. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne-Fran\u00e7aise de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their own cultural agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908-35; the majority of those hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Yvette T. M. |last=Mah\u00e9 |title=Bilingual School District Trustees and Cultural Transmission: The Alberta Experience, 1892-1939 |work=Historical Studies in Education |date=1997 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pp=65\u201382 |issn=0843-5057 |url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/download/1435/1559}}</ref>\n\n===Canadianization of immigrants===\nAfter 1870 numerous non-Anglophone immigrants arrived from Europe, including Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians and many others. Large numbers headed to the attractive free farms in the Prairie Provinces. Education was a central factor in their assimilation into Canadian culture and society.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Manfred |last=Prokop |title=Canadianization of Immigrant Children: Role of the Rural Elementary School in Alberta, 1900-1930 |work=Alberta History |year=1989 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=1\u201310 |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/9021.37.2/3.html}}</ref> An important indicator of assimilation was the use of English; the children of all immigrant groups showed a strong preference in favour of speaking English, regardless of their parents' language. From 1900 to 1930, the governments of the Prairie Provinces faced the formidable task of transforming the ethnically and linguistically diverse immigrant population into loyal and true Canadians. Many officials believed language assimilation by children would be the key to Canadianization.  However, there was opposition to the direct method of English teaching from some immigrant spokesmen. English-language usage in playground games often proved an effective device, and was systematically  used. The elementary schools especially in rural Alberta played a central role in the acculturation of the immigrants and their children, providing, according to Prokop, a community character that created a distinctive feature of Canadian schools glaringly missing in the European school tradition.\n\n==Academic versus vocational education==\nHistoric educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States,  have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines. In 1960, for example 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States.  Furthermore, the United States has long led in vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion.<ref>Seymour Martin Lipset, '' Revolution and Counterrevolution: Change and persistence in social structures'' (2nd ed, 1970) pp 40-41</ref>  According to research by Lawrence Downey:\n: Canadians, as a group, assigned considerably higher priority than did Americans to knowledge, scholarly attitudes, creative skills, aesthetic appreciation, and morality , as outcomes of schooling. Americans emphasized physical development, citizenship, patriotism, social skills, and family living much more than did Canadians.<ref>Lawrence William Downey, ''The task of public education: The perceptions of people'' (Midwest Administration Center, University of Chicago, 1960), Quoted in Lipset, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution'' p 42.</ref>\n\nIvor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era,  a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The  London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.<ref>Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin, \"Vocational education and school reform: the case of the London (Canada) Technical School, 1900-1930\" ''History of Education Review'' (1991) 20#1: 39\u201360.</ref>\n\n==Educational theory==\n\n\nOntario took the lead in the early 20th century in developing a theoretical approach to education that was not only taught in universities, but largely shaped government policies in Ontario, and in other provinces as well.<ref>Robert Stamp, \"Education and the economic and social milieu: The English-Canadian scene from the 1870\u2019s to 1914.\" in Robert M.

Until this point there were few schools, and teachers would be deemed qualified upon availability more so than intellect and ability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e590052009-189|title=Pre-service training for the rural teacher--Abstract|last=Eby|first=Harvey L.|date=1931|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> At this point they started introducing qualifications aimed at instructing teachers in how to best do their job. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shortt, Adam, 1859-1931.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/874542622|title=Canada and its provinces : a history of the Canadian people and their institutions|date=(1913)|publisher=University of Toronto Press|oclc=874542622}}</ref> The conditions for teachers at this time were quite poor. They had low wages and poor working conditions. Their salaries ranged from 400-1400 for women, or 600-2100 for men. Accounting for inflation, that would be approximately $8000 for women, or $10,000 for men by today's standards. Along with the low wages, the teachers would be responsible for everything in the school. This included janitorial duties, and administrative tasks on top of teaching the students.<ref name=\":0\" /> This made teaching a quite difficult and unappealing job. The first union for teachers was created in 1920, The Canadian Teachers Confederation (CTF). This allowed for teachers to unify with each other, as well as advocate for increased workplace rights.\n\n==Notes==\n<References/>\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Further|Bibliography of Canadian history#Education}}\n* Axelrod, Paul.

The  first product of their partnership may have been the ''Baptism of Christ'' for the Florentine [[Compagnia dello Scalzo]], the beginning of a [[monochrome]] [[fresco]] series.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=969}} By the time the partnership was dissolved, Sarto's style bore the stamp of individuality. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', it \"is marked throughout his career by an interest, exceptional among Florentines, in effects of colour and atmosphere and by sophisticated informality and natural expression of emotion.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-del-Sarto |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Frescoes at SS Annunziata in Florence==\nFrom 1509 to 1514 the [[Servite Order]] employed Del Sarto, [[Franciabigio]] and [[Andrea Feltrini]] in a programme of [[fresco]]es at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mega.it/eng/egui/monu/chssann.htm |title=mega.it |publisher=mega.it |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>  Sarto completed seven frescoes in the forecourt or atrium (the chiostro dei voti) before the Servite church, five of which illustrated the ''Life and miracles of [[Filippo Benizzi]]'',<ref>[http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid5/italy2004/florence/churches/ss_annunziata/front_cloister/dsc07633.JPG ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204092026/http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid5/italy2004/florence/churches/ss_annunziata/front_cloister/dsc07633.JPG |date=February 4, 2006 }}</ref> a Servite saint who died in 1285 (canonized 1671). He executed them rapidly, depicting the saint healing a leper through the gift of his undertunic; predicting the bad end of some blasphemers; and restoring [[exorcism|a girl possessed with a devil]]. The two final frescoes of the series depicted the healing of a child at the death bed of Filippo Benizzi and the curing of sick adults and children through his relic garment held at the church. All five frescoes were completed before the close of 1510. The original contract also required him to paint five scenes of the life and miracles of St Sebastian, but he told the Servites that he no longer wished to continue with the second cycle, most likely due to the low remuneration. The Servites convinced him to do two more frescoes in the forecourt, though of a different subject matter: a ''Procession of the Magi'' (or ''Adoration'', containing a self-portrait) finished in 1511 and a ''Nativity of the Virgin''. These paintings met with respect, the correctness of the contours being particularly admired, and earned for Sarto the nickname of \"Andrea senza errori\" (Andrea the perfect). Towards 1512 he painted an ''Annunciation'' in the [[monastery]] of S. Gallo and a ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' (Dresden).\n\nBy 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescoes, including his masterpiece, the [[Nativity of the Virgin (del Sarto)|''Nativity of the Virgin'']], which fuses the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and [[Fra Bartolomeo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/ghirland/domenico/6tornab/61tornab/2birth.html |title=Compare it to Ghirlandaio's Quattrocento treatment |publisher=Wga.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> By November 1515 he had finished at the Scalzo the ''Allegory of Justice'' and the ''Baptist preaching in the desert'', followed in 1517 by ''John Baptizing'', and other subjects.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\n==Visit to France==\n[[Image:Sarto life.jpg|thumb|left|Del Sarto's most ambitious monument, in terms of the amount of time he devoted to it, is the [[grisaille]] series in the Chiostro dello Scalzo.]]\nBefore the end of 1516, a Piet\u00e0 of Del Sarto's composition, and afterwards a Madonna, were sent to the [[France|French]] Court. This led to an invitation from [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], in 1518, and he journeyed to Paris in June of that year, along with his pupil Andrea Squarzzella, leaving his wife, Lucrezia, in Florence.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAccording to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Andrea's pupil and biographer,<ref name = \"vasari\"/> Lucrezia wrote to Andrea and demanded he return to Italy. The King assented, but only on the understanding that his absence from [[France]] was to be short.  He then entrusted Andrea with a sum of money to be expended in purchasing works of art for the French Court.  By Vasari's account, Andrea took the money and used it to buy himself a house in Florence, thus ruining his reputation and preventing him from ever returning to France.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} The story inspired [[Robert Browning]]'s poem-monologue \"[[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto Called the 'Faultless Painter']]\" (1855),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |title=Stonehill |publisher=Faculty.stonehill.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120195210/http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 }}</ref> but is now believed by some historians to be apocryphal.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 University of Toronto Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104195856/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Later works in Florence==\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Assumption of the Virgin (Poppi Altarpiece) - WGA0416.jpg|thumb|''Assumption of the Virgin'' (Poppi Altarpiece), 1530]]\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto, Head of Saint John the Baptist, c. 1523, NGA 73856.jpg|thumb|left|''Head of Saint John the Baptist'', c. 1523, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\nIn 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the ''Faith'' and ''Charity''  in the cloister of the Scalzo. These were succeeded by the ''Dance of the [[Salome|Daughter of Herodias]]'', the ''Beheading of the Baptist'',  the ''Presentation of his head to [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]'', an allegory of Hope, the ''Apparition of the Angel to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]]'' (1523) and the monochrome ''Visitation''.  This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after Andrea had returned from Luco in [[Mugello region|Mugello]], whence an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Florence had driven him and his family. In 1525 he returned to paint in the Annunziata cloister the ''[[Madonna del Sacco (Andrea del Sarto)|Madonna del Sacco]]'', a [[lunette]] named after a sack against which Joseph is represented propped.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} In this painting the generous virgin's gown and her gaze indicate his influence on the early style of pupil [[Jacopo Pontormo|Pontormo]].\n\nIn 1523 Andrea painted a copy of the portrait group of [[Pope Leo X]] by Raphael; this copy is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], while the original remains at the Pitti Palace. The Raphael painting was owned by [[Ottaviano de' Medici]], and requested by [[Federico II Gonzaga]], Duke of [[Mantua]].  Unwilling to part with the original, Ottaviano retained Andrea to produce a copy, which he passed to the Duke as the original. The imitation was so faithful that even [[Giulio Romano]], who had himself manipulated the original to some extent, was completely fooled; and, on showing the copy years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the truth, he could be convinced that it was not genuine only when a private mark on the canvas was pointed out to him by Vasari.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAndrea's final work at the Scalzo was the ''Nativity of the Baptist'' (1526).  In the following year he completed his last important painting, a [[Last Supper (Andrea del Sarto)|''Last Supper'']] at [[Chiesa San Salvi|San Salvi]] (now an inner suburb of Florence), in which all the characters appear to be portraits.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nA number of his paintings were considered to be self-portraits. A ''Portrait of a Young Man ''in the [[National Gallery, London]] was formerly believed to be a self-portrait,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-del-sarto-portrait-of-a-young-man |title=National Gallery website |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> as was the Portrait of Becuccio Bicchieraio in [[National Gallery of Scotland]],<ref>[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4:322/results/0/5398/ National Gallery of Scotland website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620214812/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4%3A322/results/0/5398/ |date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref> but both are now known not to be. There is a self-portrait at [[Alnwick Castle]], a young man about twenty years, with his elbow on a table. Another youthful portrait is in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], and the [[Pitti Palace]] contains more than one.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\n===''Madonna of the Harpies''===\n[[Image:Andrea del Sarto - Madonna of the Harpies - WGA00369.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'', 1517]]\nThe ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'' is a depiction of the Virgin and child on a pedestal, flanked by two saints (Bonaventure or Francis and John the Evangelist), and at her feet two cherubs. The pedestal is decorated with a relief depicting some feminine figures interpreted as [[harpy|harpies]] and thus gave rise, in English, to the name of the painting. Originally completed in 1517 for the convent of San Francesco dei Macci, the altarpiece now resides in the Uffizi.  In an Italy swamped with a tsunami of Madonnas, it would be easy to overlook this work; however, this commonly copied scheme also lends itself to comparison of his style with that of his contemporaries. The figures have a Leonardo da Vinci-like aura, and the stable pyramid of their composition provides a unified structure. In some ways, his rigid adherence is more classical than Leonardo da Vinci's but less so than [[Fra Bartolomeo]]'s representations of the Holy Family.\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Piet\u00e0 with Saints - WGA0395.jpg|thumb|''Piet\u00e0 with Saints'', 1523-24]]\n\n==Personal life==\nAndrea married Lucrezia (del Fede), widow of a hatter named Carlo, of [[Recanati]], on 26 December 1512.  Lucrezia appears in many of his paintings, often as a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].  However, Vasari describes her as \"faithless, jealous, and vixenish with the apprentices.\"<ref name = \"vasari\"/>  She is similarly characterized in [[Robert Browning]]'s poem.\n\nAndrea died in Florence at age 43 during an outbreak of [[Bubonic Plague]] at the end of September 1530.

The  first product of their partnership may have been the ''Baptism of Christ'' for the Florentine [[Compagnia dello Scalzo]], the beginning of a [[monochrome]] [[fresco]] series.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=969}} By the time the partnership was dissolved, Sarto's style bore the stamp of individuality. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', it \"is marked throughout his career by an interest, exceptional among Florentines, in effects of colour and atmosphere and by sophisticated informality and natural expression of emotion.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-del-Sarto |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Frescoes at SS Annunziata in Florence==\nFrom 1509 to 1514 the [[Servite Order]] employed Del Sarto, [[Franciabigio]] and [[Andrea Feltrini]] in a programme of [[fresco]]es at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mega.it/eng/egui/monu/chssann.htm |title=mega.it |publisher=mega.it |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>  Sarto completed seven frescoes in the forecourt or atrium (the chiostro dei voti) before the Servite church, five of which illustrated the ''Life and miracles of [[Filippo Benizzi]]'',<ref>[http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid5/italy2004/florence/churches/ss_annunziata/front_cloister/dsc07633.JPG ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204092026/http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid5/italy2004/florence/churches/ss_annunziata/front_cloister/dsc07633.JPG |date=February 4, 2006 }}</ref> a Servite saint who died in 1285 (canonized 1671). He executed them rapidly, depicting the saint healing a leper through the gift of his undertunic; predicting the bad end of some blasphemers; and restoring [[exorcism|a girl possessed with a devil]]. The two final frescoes of the series depicted the healing of a child at the death bed of Filippo Benizzi and the curing of sick adults and children through his relic garment held at the church. All five frescoes were completed before the close of 1510. The original contract also required him to paint five scenes of the life and miracles of St Sebastian, but he told the Servites that he no longer wished to continue with the second cycle, most likely due to the low remuneration. The Servites convinced him to do two more frescoes in the forecourt, though of a different subject matter: a ''Procession of the Magi'' (or ''Adoration'', containing a self-portrait) finished in 1511 and a ''Nativity of the Virgin''. These paintings met with respect, the correctness of the contours being particularly admired, and earned for Sarto the nickname of \"Andrea senza errori\" (Andrea the perfect). Towards 1512 he painted an ''Annunciation'' in the [[monastery]] of S. Gallo and a ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' (Dresden).\n\nBy 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescoes, including his masterpiece, the [[Nativity of the Virgin (del Sarto)|''Nativity of the Virgin'']], which fuses the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and [[Fra Bartolomeo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/ghirland/domenico/6tornab/61tornab/2birth.html |title=Compare it to Ghirlandaio's Quattrocento treatment |publisher=Wga.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> By November 1515 he had finished at the Scalzo the ''Allegory of Justice'' and the ''Baptist preaching in the desert'', followed in 1517 by ''John Baptizing'', and other subjects.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\n==Visit to France==\n[[Image:Sarto life.jpg|thumb|left|Del Sarto's most ambitious monument, in terms of the amount of time he devoted to it, is the [[grisaille]] series in the Chiostro dello Scalzo.]]\nBefore the end of 1516, a Piet\u00e0 of Del Sarto's composition, and afterwards a Madonna, were sent to the [[France|French]] Court. This led to an invitation from [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], in 1518, and he journeyed to Paris in June of that year, along with his pupil Andrea Squarzzella, leaving his wife, Lucrezia, in Florence.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAccording to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Andrea's pupil and biographer,<ref name = \"vasari\"/> Lucrezia wrote to Andrea and demanded he return to Italy. The King assented, but only on the understanding that his absence from [[France]] was to be short.  He then entrusted Andrea with a sum of money to be expended in purchasing works of art for the French Court.  By Vasari's account, Andrea took the money and used it to buy himself a house in Florence, thus ruining his reputation and preventing him from ever returning to France.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} The story inspired [[Robert Browning]]'s poem-monologue \"[[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto Called the 'Faultless Painter']]\" (1855),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |title=Stonehill |publisher=Faculty.stonehill.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120195210/http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 }}</ref> but is now believed by some historians to be apocryphal.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 University of Toronto Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104195856/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Later works in Florence==\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Assumption of the Virgin (Poppi Altarpiece) - WGA0416.jpg|thumb|''Assumption of the Virgin'' (Poppi Altarpiece), 1530]]\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto, Head of Saint John the Baptist, c. 1523, NGA 73856.jpg|thumb|left|''Head of Saint John the Baptist'', c. 1523, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\nIn 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the ''Faith'' and ''Charity''  in the cloister of the Scalzo. These were succeeded by the ''Dance of the [[Salome|Daughter of Herodias]]'', the ''Beheading of the Baptist'',  the ''Presentation of his head to [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]'', an allegory of Hope, the ''Apparition of the Angel to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]]'' (1523) and the monochrome ''Visitation''.  This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after Andrea had returned from Luco in [[Mugello region|Mugello]], whence an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Florence had driven him and his family. In 1525 he returned to paint in the Annunziata cloister the ''[[Madonna del Sacco (Andrea del Sarto)|Madonna del Sacco]]'', a [[lunette]] named after a sack against which Joseph is represented propped.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} In this painting the generous virgin's gown and her gaze indicate his influence on the early style of pupil [[Jacopo Pontormo|Pontormo]].\n\nIn 1523 Andrea painted a copy of the portrait group of [[Pope Leo X]] by Raphael; this copy is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], while the original remains at the Pitti Palace. The Raphael painting was owned by [[Ottaviano de' Medici]], and requested by [[Federico II Gonzaga]], Duke of [[Mantua]].  Unwilling to part with the original, Ottaviano retained Andrea to produce a copy, which he passed to the Duke as the original. The imitation was so faithful that even [[Giulio Romano]], who had himself manipulated the original to some extent, was completely fooled; and, on showing the copy years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the truth, he could be convinced that it was not genuine only when a private mark on the canvas was pointed out to him by Vasari.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAndrea's final work at the Scalzo was the ''Nativity of the Baptist'' (1526).  In the following year he completed his last important painting, a [[Last Supper (Andrea del Sarto)|''Last Supper'']] at [[Chiesa San Salvi|San Salvi]] (now an inner suburb of Florence), in which all the characters appear to be portraits.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nA number of his paintings were considered to be self-portraits. A ''Portrait of a Young Man ''in the [[National Gallery, London]] was formerly believed to be a self-portrait,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-del-sarto-portrait-of-a-young-man |title=National Gallery website |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> as was the Portrait of Becuccio Bicchieraio in [[National Gallery of Scotland]],<ref>[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4:322/results/0/5398/ National Gallery of Scotland website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620214812/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4%3A322/results/0/5398/ |date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref> but both are now known not to be. There is a self-portrait at [[Alnwick Castle]], a young man about twenty years, with his elbow on a table. Another youthful portrait is in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], and the [[Pitti Palace]] contains more than one.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\n===''Madonna of the Harpies''===\n[[Image:Andrea del Sarto - Madonna of the Harpies - WGA00369.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'', 1517]]\nThe ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'' is a depiction of the Virgin and child on a pedestal, flanked by two saints (Bonaventure or Francis and John the Evangelist), and at her feet two cherubs. The pedestal is decorated with a relief depicting some feminine figures interpreted as [[harpy|harpies]] and thus gave rise, in English, to the name of the painting. Originally completed in 1517 for the convent of San Francesco dei Macci, the altarpiece now resides in the Uffizi.  In an Italy swamped with a tsunami of Madonnas, it would be easy to overlook this work; however, this commonly copied scheme also lends itself to comparison of his style with that of his contemporaries. The figures have a Leonardo da Vinci-like aura, and the stable pyramid of their composition provides a unified structure. In some ways, his rigid adherence is more classical than Leonardo da Vinci's but less so than [[Fra Bartolomeo]]'s representations of the Holy Family.\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Piet\u00e0 with Saints - WGA0395.jpg|thumb|''Piet\u00e0 with Saints'', 1523-24]]\n\n==Personal life==\nAndrea married Lucrezia (del Fede), widow of a hatter named Carlo, of [[Recanati]], on 26 December 1512.  Lucrezia appears in many of his paintings, often as a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].  However, Vasari describes her as \"faithless, jealous, and vixenish with the apprentices.\"<ref name = \"vasari\"/>  She is similarly characterized in [[Robert Browning]]'s poem.\n\nAndrea died in Florence at age 43 during an outbreak of [[Bubonic Plague]] at the end of September 1530.
