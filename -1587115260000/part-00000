On 9 April 2020, the season was won by Romain Ben, who had played the game as himself, and won the [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}) prize that came along with it. \u00c9l\u00e9a was the runner-up.\n\n== Format ==\nThe contestants, or \"players\", move into the same apartment building. However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Harcourt wondered what a [[Reality competition|reality show]] would look like if the people never met face-to-face. He had also been considering the idea of a [[bird's-eye view]]-style documentary of an apartment building, seeing into each of their lives. He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

Instead, the two lowest-rated players were at risk and were the only ones that could be blocked. The five other players (excluding Edmundo & Jo\u00e3o, as a new player) voted publicly in the Circle Chat to block one of the bottom two. Romain, Maxime and Rudy chose to block C\u00e9dric, and Ines and Gary chose to block \u00c9l\u00e9a. Since C\u00e9dric received more votes, he was blocked.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: In Episode 9, the ratings were not published. Instead, the highest-rated player automatically became a secret \"Superinfluencer\", who had the sole decision on whom to block.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: In Episode 10, there were no Influencers. Instead, the least popular player was instantly blocked.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: In Episode 12, the Final Set of Ratings determined the winner of ''The Circle Game''. In a twist, the last three blocked players (Ines, Virginie, Paolo) also contributed for the Final Ratings, as they were apart of the Final 8 players -  they rated all remaining players before their post-block room visit. \n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\nJoe Keller from ''[[Decider (website)|Decider]]'', in a regular series called \"Stream It or Skip It\", told his audience to stream it. His reasons include that the format is still solid and the gist of the show is still fresh, despite four previous [[The Circle (franchise)|international seasons]]. However, he does comment that the cast is lacking in diversity, especially since this season aired after the \"[[Human sexuality|sexually-fluid]]\" cast of the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81044719}}\n* [https://www.instagram.com/circlegame/ @circlegame] on [[Instagram]]\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n{{The Circle (franchise)|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circle French TV Series}}\n[[Category:2010s reality television series]]\n[[Category:French reality television series]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:French-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:The Circle (TV series)]]\n[[Category:Television series about social media]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|French reality television show}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name             = The Circle France\n| image                 = The Circle France.png\n| caption               = The official title screen for ''The Circle France''.\n| genre                 = [[Reality television|Reality competition]]\n| creative_director     = \n| presenter             = ''None''\n| narrated              = \n| country               = [[France]]\n| theme_music_composer  = \n| opentheme             = \n| language              = French\n| num_series            = 1\n| num_episodes          = 12\n| executive_producer    = \n| camera                = \n| runtime               = 37\u201351 minutes\n| channel               = [[Netflix]]\n| company               = [[Studio Lambert]]\n| distributor           = \n| picture_format        = \n| audio_format          = \n| released              = {{Start date|2020|4|9|df=yes}}\n| related               = {{Plainlist|\n* ''[[The Circle (British TV series)|The Circle UK]]''\n* ''[[The Circle (American TV series)|The Circle US]]''\n* ''[[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|The Circle Brazil]]''\n}}\n| website               = https://www.thecirclecasting.com/the-circle-france\n}}\n\n'''''The Circle France''''' (also known as '''''The Circle Game''''' in [[France]])<ref name=\"trailer\">{{cite web |title=Season 1 Trailer: The Circle France |url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/81189754?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C0%2C30a8b6b7-19b1-47c5-82ed-01092634917d-7331629%2C%2C&t=0 |website=netflix.com |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=26 March 2020 |language=French |date=26 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> is a French [[Reality television|reality competition]] show, produced by [[Studio Lambert]] and Motion Content Group which first aired on [[Netflix]] in 9 April 2020 that is based on a [[The Circle (British TV series)|British TV series of the same name]].<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Peter |title='The Circle': Netflix Lines Up French & Brazilian Remakes As Studio Lambert Uses UK Hub For Reality Format |url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/the-circle-netflix-france-brazil-1202519369/ |website=deadline.com |publisher=Deadline |accessdate=16 October 2019 |date=18 December 2018}}</ref> Along with ''The Circle France'', Netflix also released separate versions of ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' in the [[United States]] and [[Brazil]].<ref name=\"hollywood_reporter\">{{cite web |last1=Elise Sandberg |first1=Bryn |title=Netflix to Adapt U.K. Reality Series 'The Circle' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-adapt-uk-reality-series-circle-1150330 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref> The show bills itself as a game based around social media, with the concept that \"anyone can be anyone in ''The Circle''\".

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person.

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings.

Instead, the two lowest-rated players were at risk and were the only ones that could be blocked. The five other players (excluding Edmundo & Jo\u00e3o, as a new player) voted publicly in the Circle Chat to block one of the bottom two. Romain, Maxime and Rudy chose to block C\u00e9dric, and Ines and Gary chose to block \u00c9l\u00e9a. Since C\u00e9dric received more votes, he was blocked.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: In Episode 9, the ratings were not published. Instead, the highest-rated player automatically became a secret \"Superinfluencer\", who had the sole decision on whom to block.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: In Episode 10, there were no Influencers. Instead, the least popular player was instantly blocked.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: In Episode 12, the Final Set of Ratings determined the winner of ''The Circle Game''. In a twist, the last three blocked players (Ines, Virginie, Paolo) also contributed for the Final Ratings, as they were apart of the Final 8 players -  they rated all remaining players before their post-block room visit. \n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\nJoe Keller from ''[[Decider (website)|Decider]]'', in a regular series called \"Stream It or Skip It\", told his audience to stream it. His reasons include that the format is still solid and the gist of the show is still fresh, despite four previous [[The Circle (franchise)|international seasons]]. However, he does comment that the cast is lacking in diversity, especially since this season aired after the \"[[Human sexuality|sexually-fluid]]\" cast of the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81044719}}\n* [https://www.instagram.com/circlegame/ @circlegame] on [[Instagram]]\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n{{The Circle (franchise)|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circle French TV Series}}\n[[Category:2010s reality television series]]\n[[Category:French reality television series]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:French-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:The Circle (TV series)]]\n[[Category:Television series about social media]]\n", "name_user": "216.251.118.195", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(French_TV_series)"}

It is a [[creole language]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IGEiKkpNP-gC Pidgins and Creoles: an introduction by Jacques Arends, Pieter Muysken, Norval Smith] (page 17)</ref> based on [[Kikongo]], a family of closely related [[Bantu languages]]. It is an official language in [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n\nIt is not entirely accurate to call Kituba a creole language as it lacks the [[Stratum (linguistics)|distinction between superstrate and substrate influence]] that is typical of creole development.\n\n==Names==\nKituba is known by many names among its speakers. In the [[Republic of Congo]] it is called ''Munukutuba'' or ''Kituba''. The former is a grammatically incorrect phrase which means literally \"I to speak\". The latter means simply \"speech\". The name ''Kituba'' is used in the constitution of the Republic of Congo.\n\nIn the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] it is called ''Kikongo ya leta'' (i.e. Kikongo of the state administration), but it is often called in short ''Kikongo'', especially out of the region of ethnic [[Bakongo]] people. The constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo lists Kikongo as one of the national languages. In fact, it refers to Kikongo ya leta (i.e. Kituba), because a translation of the constitution itself is written in Kituba but no translation exists in Kikongo.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{discuss}}\n\nThere are also other historical names such as ''Kibulamatadi'', ''Kikwango'', ''Ikeleve'' (literally: ''He is not here''), and ''Kizabave'' but they have largely fallen out of use. In the academic circles the language is called ''Kikongo-Kituba''.\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[Image:LanguageMap-Kikongo-Kituba.png|thumb|right|350px|Dialect map of Kikongo and Kituba]]\nThe majority of Kituba speakers live in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is spoken as the primary lingua franca in the provinces of [[Kongo Central]], [[Kwango Province|Kwango]] and [[Kwilu Province|Kwilu]] and to a lesser extent in [[Kinshasa]], [[Mai-Ndombe Province|Mai-Ndombe]] and [[Kasai Province|Kasai]].\n\nKituba is the largest language of the Republic of Congo. It is spoken in the southern half of the country, in regions of [[Kouilou Region|Kouilou]] (especially in [[Pointe-Noire]]), [[Niari Region|Niari]], [[Bouenza]], [[L\u00e9koumou]], [[Pool Region|Pool]] and in the capital [[Brazzaville]]. [[Lingala]] is more popular in the north.\n\nThe status of Kituba in Angola is not known. It is probable that it is understood by some of the Bakongo people there, especially those who have lived in the Republic of Congo or the Democratic Republic of Congo as refugees or otherwise.\n\n==Official status==\nKituba is a national language in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In practice the term ''national language'' means that it is a language of regional administration and elementary education.\n\nA national language is also one that is used for public and mass communication. National public radios and televisions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the Republic of Congo use Kituba as one of their main languages for evening news.\n\n==History==\nFirst Kituba developed downriver [[River Congo|Congo]], an area which is inhabited by the [[Bakongo]].\n\nThere are several theories on how Kituba came into being. One theory claims that it had already evolved at the time of the [[Kongo Kingdom]] as a simplified interdialectal trade language, which the European colonists subsequently took into use for regional administration. Another theory claims that a simplified trade language called Kifyoti was developed at the Portuguese coastal trading 18\npost and it was later spread upstream by the Christian missionaries to the region between the Kwango and the Kasai rivers where it evolved further (hence the name Kikwango). Yet another theory emphasizes the construction of the [[Matadi]]-[[Kinshasa]] railroad at the end of the 1800s, which involved forced labour from [[West Africa]], lower Congo, and the neighbouring [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]] region. The workers had diverse linguistic backgrounds which gave birth to a grammatically simplified language.\n\nRegardless of the genesis, Kituba established itself in the large towns that were found during the colonial period between 1885 and 1960. Kituba is spoken as the primary language in the large Bakongo cities of [[Moanda]], [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]], [[Matadi]], [[Pointe-Noire]], [[Dolisie]], [[Nkayi, Republic of the Congo|Nkayi]], and [[Brazzaville]] and also in large non-Bakongo cities of [[Bandundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bandundu]], [[Kikwit]], and [[Ilebo]].\n\nA translation of the [[New Testament]] in Kituba was completed and published in 2005.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mkw Kituba ''[[Ethnologue]]'']</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Vowels===\nKituba has five vowel phonemes: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. They are very similar to the vowels of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. The vowels are pronounced as follows:\n* /a/ is pronounced like the \"a\" in father\n* /e/ is pronounced like the \"e\" in bed\n* /i/ is pronounced like the \"i\" in ski or ring\n* /o/ is pronounced like the first part of the \"o\" in home, or like a tenser version of \"o\" in \"lot\"\n* /u/ is pronounced like the \"oo\" of fool\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!colspan=2|\n!colspan=2| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=2| [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]<br>/[[Interdental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=2| [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2| [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!colspan=2| [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!colspan=2| <small>[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]</small>\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|m}}\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|n\u032a|n}}\n|colspan=2|\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|\u014b}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| <small>[[Stop consonant|Stop]]</small>\n! <small>plain</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|p}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|b}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|t\u032a|t}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|d\u032a|d}}\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|k}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|g}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n! <small>[[Prenasalized stop|prenasal.]]</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u1d50p||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u1d50b\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u207ft||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u207fd\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u1d51k||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u1d51g\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| <small>[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]</small>\n! <small>plain</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|f}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|v}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|s}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|z}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"|({{IPAlink|h}})||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\n|-\n! <small>prenasal.</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u1dacf||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u1dacv\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u207fs||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u207fz\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!colspan=2| <small>[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|w}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|l}}\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|j}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n\nNotes:\n* Word-initial voiceless prenasalized consonants are reduced to simple consonants in some dialects: ''mpimpa'' and ''nkento'' become ''pimpa'' and ''kento'' in Kituba of Pointe-Noire.\n* Some dialects add stop to prenasalized alveolar fricatives: ''Kinsasa'' and ''nzila'' become ''Kintsasa'' and ''ndzila''.\n* Alveolar fricatives may become postalveolar ({{IPAlink|\u0283}} or {{IPAlink|\u0292}}) before /i/.\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nKituba has subject and object pronouns. The object pronouns are used in place of subject pronouns when the subject is being emphasized.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2| Person\n!colspan=2 align=\"center\"| Singular\n!colspan=2 align=\"center\"| Plural\n|-\n!

The classes 9 and 11 have in effect merged with the singular class with zero prefix, and their plural is formed with generic plural class prefix ''ba-''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"| Singular\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"| Plural\n|-\n!Class !!

Most verb forms have long and short versions. The long forms are used in formal written communication whereas the short forms have developed for spoken communication.\n\nThe irregular conjugation of the verb ''kuvanda'' or ''kuvuanda'' (to be) is presented in the table below. It is the only irregular verb in Kituba.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Tense !! Long form !! Short form !! Example !! Translation\n|-\n| '''Present and immediate future''' || kele || ke || ''Yau kele nkosi.'' || It is a lion.\n|-\n| '''Future''' || kele/ata kuv(u)anda || ke/ta v(u)anda || ''Mu ta vuanda tata.'' || I will be a father.\n|-\n| '''Present progressive''' || kele kuv(u)andaka || ke v(u)andaka || ''Nge ke vuandaka zoba.'' || You are being stupid.\n|-\n| '''Future progressive''' || ata kuv(u)andaka || ta v(u)andaka || ''Beno ta vuandaka ya kukuela.'' || You will be married.\n|-\n| '''Past''' || v(u)anda || || ''Yandi vuanda kuna.'' || He was there.\n|-\n| '''Past progressive''' || v(u)andaka || || ''Beto vuandaka banduku.'' || We used to be friends.\n|-\n| '''Past perfect''' || mene kuv(u)anda || me v(u)anda || ''Yandi me vuanda na Matadi.'' || He was in Matadi.\n|-\n| '''Past perfect progressive''' || mene kuv(u)andaka || me v(u)andaka || ''Yandi me vuandaka mulongi.'' || She has been a teacher.\n|}\n\nAll other verbs are conjugated with the help of auxiliary verbs. The conjugation of the verb ''kusala'' (to do) is presented in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Tense !! Long form !! Short form !! Example !! Translation\n|-\n| '''Present and immediate future''' || kele kusala || ke sala || ''Yandi ke sala.'' || He works. / He will work.\n|-\n| '''Present progressive''' || kele kusalaka || ke salaka || ''Yandi ke salaka.'' || He is working.\n|-\n| '''Past''' || salaka || salaka || ''Yandi salaka.'' || He worked.\n|-\n| '''Immediate past''' || mene sala || me sala || ''Yandi me sala.'' || He has worked.\n|-\n| '''Immediate past progressive || mene salaka || me salaka || ''Yandi me salaka.'' || He has been working.\n|-\n| '''Past progressive''' || vuandaka kusala || va sala || Yandi vuandaka kusala. || ''He used to work.''\n|-\n| '''Narrative''' || sala || sala\n|-\n| '''Future''' || ata sala || ta sala || ''Yandi ta sala.'' || He will work.\n|-\n| '''Future progressive''' || ata salaka || ta salaka || ''Yandi ta salaka.'' || He will be working.\n|}\n\n==Voice==\n\nThe suffix indicating [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] is adding after the verb root and before the suffix indicating tense.\n\nThe most common forms are \"ila\", indicating action to or toward someone, and \"ana\", indicating mutual or reciprocal action:\n\nKutanga \"to read\", Tangila \"read to\", Tangilaka \"read to\" (past)\n\nSadisa  \"to help\", Sadisana \"help one another\",  Sadisanaka \"helped one another (past)<ref>Harold W.

It is a [[creole language]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IGEiKkpNP-gC Pidgins and Creoles: an introduction by Jacques Arends, Pieter Muysken, Norval Smith] (page 17)</ref> based on [[Kikongo]], a family of closely related [[Bantu languages]]. It is an official language in [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n\nIt is not entirely accurate to call Kituba a creole language as it lacks the [[Stratum (linguistics)|distinction between superstrate and substrate influence]] that is typical of creole development.\n\n==Names==\nKituba is known by many names among its speakers. In the [[Republic of Congo]] it is called ''Munukutuba'' or ''Kituba''. The former is a grammatically incorrect phrase which means literally \"I to speak\". The latter means simply \"speech\". The name ''Kituba'' is used in the constitution of the Republic of Congo.\n\nIn the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] it is called ''Kikongo ya leta'' (i.e. Kikongo of the state administration), but it is often called in short ''Kikongo'', especially out of the region of ethnic [[Bakongo]] people. The constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo lists Kikongo as one of the national languages. In fact, it refers to Kikongo ya leta (i.e. Kituba), because a translation of the constitution itself is written in Kituba but no translation exists in Kikongo.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{discuss}}\n\nThere are also other historical names such as ''Kibulamatadi'', ''Kikwango'', ''Ikeleve'' (literally: ''He is not here''), and ''Kizabave'' but they have largely fallen out of use. In the academic circles the language is called ''Kikongo-Kituba''.\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[Image:LanguageMap-Kikongo-Kituba.png|thumb|right|350px|Dialect map of Kikongo and Kituba]]\nThe majority of Kituba speakers live in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is spoken as the primary lingua franca in the provinces of [[Kongo Central]], [[Kwango Province|Kwango]] and [[Kwilu Province|Kwilu]] and to a lesser extent in [[Kinshasa]], [[Mai-Ndombe Province|Mai-Ndombe]] and [[Kasai Province|Kasai]].\n\nKituba is the largest language of the Republic of Congo. It is spoken in the southern half of the country, in regions of [[Kouilou Region|Kouilou]] (especially in [[Pointe-Noire]]), [[Niari Region|Niari]], [[Bouenza]], [[L\u00e9koumou]], [[Pool Region|Pool]] and in the capital [[Brazzaville]]. [[Lingala]] is more popular in the north.\n\nThe status of Kituba in Angola is not known. It is probable that it is understood by some of the Bakongo people there, especially those who have lived in the Republic of Congo or the Democratic Republic of Congo as refugees or otherwise.\n\n==Official status==\nKituba is a national language in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In practice the term ''national language'' means that it is a language of regional administration and elementary education.\n\nA national language is also one that is used for public and mass communication. National public radios and televisions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the Republic of Congo use Kituba as one of their main languages for evening news.\n\n==History==\nFirst Kituba developed downriver [[River Congo|Congo]], an area which is inhabited by the [[Bakongo]].\n\nThere are several theories on how Kituba came into being. One theory claims that it had already evolved at the time of the [[Kongo Kingdom]] as a simplified interdialectal trade language, which the European colonists subsequently took into use for regional administration. Another theory claims that a simplified trade language called Kifyoti was developed at the Portuguese coastal trading 18\npost and it was later spread upstream by the Christian missionaries to the region between the Kwango and the Kasai rivers where it evolved further (hence the name Kikwango). Yet another theory emphasizes the construction of the [[Matadi]]-[[Kinshasa]] railroad at the end of the 1800s, which involved forced labour from [[West Africa]], lower Congo, and the neighbouring [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]] region. The workers had diverse linguistic backgrounds which gave birth to a grammatically simplified language.\n\nRegardless of the genesis, Kituba established itself in the large towns that were found during the colonial period between 1885 and 1960. Kituba is spoken as the primary language in the large Bakongo cities of [[Moanda]], [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]], [[Matadi]], [[Pointe-Noire]], [[Dolisie]], [[Nkayi, Republic of the Congo|Nkayi]], and [[Brazzaville]] and also in large non-Bakongo cities of [[Bandundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bandundu]], [[Kikwit]], and [[Ilebo]].\n\nA translation of the [[New Testament]] in Kituba was completed and published in 2005.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mkw Kituba ''[[Ethnologue]]'']</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Vowels===\nKituba has five vowel phonemes: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. They are very similar to the vowels of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. The vowels are pronounced as follows:\n* /a/ is pronounced like the \"a\" in father\n* /e/ is pronounced like the \"e\" in bed\n* /i/ is pronounced like the \"i\" in ski or ring\n* /o/ is pronounced like the first part of the \"o\" in home, or like a tenser version of \"o\" in \"lot\"\n* /u/ is pronounced like the \"oo\" of fool\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!colspan=2|\n!colspan=2| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=2| [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]<br>/[[Interdental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=2| [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2| [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!colspan=2| [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!colspan=2| <small>[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]</small>\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|m}}\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|n\u032a|n}}\n|colspan=2|\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|\u014b}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| <small>[[Stop consonant|Stop]]</small>\n! <small>plain</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|p}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|b}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|t\u032a|t}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|d\u032a|d}}\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|k}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|g}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n! <small>[[Prenasalized stop|prenasal.]]</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u1d50p||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u1d50b\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u207ft||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u207fd\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u1d51k||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u1d51g\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!rowspan=2| <small>[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]</small>\n! <small>plain</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|f}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|v}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|s}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|z}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"|({{IPAlink|h}})||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\n|-\n! <small>prenasal.</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u1dacf||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u1dacv\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|\u207fs||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|\u207fz\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n!colspan=2| <small>[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|w}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|l}}\n|width=20px style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||width=20px style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPAlink|j}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n\nNotes:\n* Word-initial voiceless prenasalized consonants are reduced to simple consonants in some dialects: ''mpimpa'' and ''nkento'' become ''pimpa'' and ''kento'' in Kituba of Pointe-Noire.\n* Some dialects add stop to prenasalized alveolar fricatives: ''Kinsasa'' and ''nzila'' become ''Kintsasa'' and ''ndzila''.\n* Alveolar fricatives may become postalveolar ({{IPAlink|\u0283}} or {{IPAlink|\u0292}}) before /i/.\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nKituba has subject and object pronouns. The object pronouns are used in place of subject pronouns when the subject is being emphasized.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2| Person\n!colspan=2 align=\"center\"| Singular\n!colspan=2 align=\"center\"| Plural\n|-\n! Subject !! Object !! Subject !!

The classes 9 and 11 have in effect merged with the singular class with zero prefix, and their plural is formed with generic plural class prefix ''ba-''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"| Singular\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"| Plural\n|-\n!Class !!

Most verb forms have long and short versions. The long forms are used in formal written communication whereas the short forms have developed for spoken communication.\n\nThe irregular conjugation of the verb ''kuvanda'' or ''kuvuanda'' (to be) is presented in the table below. It is the only irregular verb in Kituba.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Tense !! Long form !! Short form !! Example !! Translation\n|-\n| '''Present and immediate future''' || kele || ke || ''Yau kele nkosi.'' || It is a lion.\n|-\n| '''Future''' || kele/ata kuv(u)anda || ke/ta v(u)anda || ''Mu ta vuanda tata.'' || I will be a father.\n|-\n| '''Present progressive''' || kele kuv(u)andaka || ke v(u)andaka || ''Nge ke vuandaka zoba.'' || You are being stupid.\n|-\n| '''Future progressive''' || ata kuv(u)andaka || ta v(u)andaka || ''Beno ta vuandaka ya kukuela.'' || You will be married.\n|-\n| '''Past''' || v(u)anda || || ''Yandi vuanda kuna.'' || He was there.\n|-\n| '''Past progressive''' || v(u)andaka || || ''Beto vuandaka banduku.'' || We used to be friends.\n|-\n| '''Past perfect''' || mene kuv(u)anda || me v(u)anda || ''Yandi me vuanda na Matadi.'' || He was in Matadi.\n|-\n| '''Past perfect progressive''' || mene kuv(u)andaka || me v(u)andaka || ''Yandi me vuandaka mulongi.'' || She has been a teacher.\n|}\n\nAll other verbs are conjugated with the help of auxiliary verbs. The conjugation of the verb ''kusala'' (to do) is presented in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Tense !! Long form !! Short form !! Example !! Translation\n|-\n| '''Present and immediate future''' || kele kusala || ke sala || ''Yandi ke sala.'' || He works. / He will work.\n|-\n| '''Present progressive''' || kele kusalaka || ke salaka || ''Yandi ke salaka.'' || He is working.\n|-\n| '''Past''' || salaka || salaka || ''Yandi salaka.'' || He worked.\n|-\n| '''Immediate past''' || mene sala || me sala || ''Yandi me sala.'' || He has worked.\n|-\n| '''Immediate past progressive || mene salaka || me salaka || ''Yandi me salaka.'' || He has been working.\n|-\n| '''Past progressive''' || vuandaka kusala || va sala || Yandi vuandaka kusala. || ''He used to work.''\n|-\n| '''Narrative''' || sala || sala\n|-\n| '''Future''' || ata sala || ta sala || ''Yandi ta sala.'' || He will work.\n|-\n| '''Future progressive''' || ata salaka || ta salaka || ''Yandi ta salaka.'' || He will be working.\n|}\n\n==Voice==\n\nThe suffix indicating [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] is adding after the verb root and before the suffix indicating tense.\n\nThe most common forms are \"ila\", indicating action to or toward someone, and \"ana\", indicating mutual or reciprocal action:\n\nKutanga \"to read\", Tangila \"read to\", Tangilaka \"read to\" (past)\n\nSadisa  \"to help\", Sadisana \"help one another\",  Sadisanaka \"helped one another (past)<ref>Harold W.
