At the sound of the roar and the flash of light, it will be precisely 6:43 P.M. on Maple Street...This is Maple Street on a late Saturday afternoon. Maple Street in the last calm and reflective moment - before the monsters came.}}\n\n==Plot==\nMaple Street is full of children playing and adults talking when a shadow passes over, accompanied by a roar and a flash of light. Everyone notices, but they assume \nr]] and quickly resume their activities. The residents soon discover that their power went off, affecting stoves, lawn mowers, cars and phones. They gather in the street to discuss the situation. Pete Van Horn, hammer slung in his bib overalls, volunteers to walk over to Floral Street, the next street over, to see if it is affected as well. His neighbors, Steve Brand and Charlie Farnsworth, decide to go into town, but Tommy, a neighborhood boy, urges them not to go. Tommy has read a story of an [[alien invasion]] causing similar issues, and says that the monsters do not want anyone to leave the street. Tommy adds that in the story, the aliens are living as a family that appears to be human but who are actually scouts, and the power outage that they cause is meant to isolate the neighborhood. The adults are incredulous, assuring him that the cause is natural, perhaps the result of [[sunspots]]. Charlie wonders if Pete Van Horn was successful in making it to Floral Street.\n\nAnother resident, Les Goodman, tries unsuccessfully to start his car. As he is walking over to join the other residents, the car starts by itself. The bizarre behavior of his car, coupled with the fact that, when the situation began, Les did not join in the general speculation, makes the neighbors suspect that Les may be an alien, as suggested by Tommy's story. Charlie says Les had always been an oddball, and suggests they go over and investigate, while Steve asks them to be calm and not act like a mob. As they all gather, conversation turns sinister. One woman brings up Les's late nights spent standing in the garden looking up at the sky, as if waiting or looking for something. Les, defending himself as a resident of Maple Street for 5 years, claims to suffer from [[insomnia]], admonishes his neighbors that they should take caution and not act rashly or allow panic. Steve tries to defuse the situation and prevent it from becoming a [[witch-hunt]].\n\nAs darkness descends, Charlie begins keeping watch over Les Goodman's house. Steve suggests Charlie go home and go to bed. Another neighbor, Don, mentions that Steve has built a [[ham radio]], which Charlie then claims no one has ever seen, the implication being that Steve is secretly talking to aliens. Steve and the other neighbors continue to argue, using each person's idiosyncrasies as evidence that they are an alien. Steve warns that such behavior, looking for a scapegoat, is the surest way for the entire neighborhood to \"eat each other alive\".\n\nA shadowy figure carrying a hammer is seen walking toward them. Tommy exclaims that it is the monster.  Claiming it may be necessary for protection, Don obtains a shotgun which Steve quickly confiscates, insisting that no one is shooting anybody. As the figure gets closer, Charlie panics, grabs the shotgun, and shoots the figure, thinking it is an alien. When the crowd reaches the fallen figure, they realize it is Pete van Horn, returning from his scouting mission on Floral Street, and he is now dead. As Charlie struggles to defend his hasty action, the lights in his house come on. The neighbors voice suspicions that Pete had discovered evidence that Charlie is an alien, and Charlie shot Pete to prevent exposure, and even Steve is too angered by Pete's death to protect Charlie. Charlie makes a run for his house; everyone chases him, throwing stones, one of which hits Charlie in the head creating a bleeding gash. Terrified, Charlie attempts to deflect suspicion onto Tommy. While his mother is quick to defend him, several neighbors agree with this idea, as Tommy was the only one who knew about the aliens' plans. Steve continues to try to defuse the situation, but no one listens.\n\nLights begin flashing on and off in houses throughout the neighborhood; lawn mower and car engines start and stop for no apparent reason. The mob becomes hysterical, hurling accusations, smashing windows and taking up weapons as the situation devolves into an all-out riot.\n\nThe scene cuts to a nearby hilltop, where it is revealed the shadow that flew overhead is, indeed, an alien spaceship. Its crew are watching the riot on Maple Street while using a device to manipulate the neighborhood's power. They comment on how simply fiddling with consistency leads people to descend into paranoia and panic, and that this is a pattern that can be exploited. They also discuss their intention to use this strategy to conquer Earth, one neighborhood at a time. They then ascend a stairway into their spaceship.\n\n==Closing narration==\n{{cquote|The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices...to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill...and suspicion can destroy...and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own \u2013 for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the Twilight Zone.}}\n\n==Production==\nThe aliens are wearing uniforms left over from the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. Also, the mockup set of the retractable stairway, leading into the lower half of the [[C-57D]] cruiser from the same film, is reused for this scene. At the end of the episode, a stock footage effects shot of the cruiser in space can be seen. (The same shot was also used in \"[[Third from the Sun]]\".) This technique was also used in \"[[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|To Serve Man]]\". The cruiser is shown upside down when compared to its orientation in ''Forbidden Planet''.\n\n==2003 Remake==\n{{Infobox television episode\n|title        = The Monsters Are on Maple Street\n|series       = [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]\n|image        = \n|caption      = \n|season       = 1\n|episode      = 32\n|airdate      = February 19, 2003\n|production   = 130\n|writer       = [[Rod Serling]]\n|director     = [[Debbie Allen]]\n|guests       = {{unbulleted list|[[Andrew McCarthy]]|[[Titus Welliver]]}}\n|season_article = \n|episode_list = \n|prev         = [[It's Still a Good Life]]\n|next         = Memphis\n}}\nA 2003 remake of the episode was produced for the 2002 revival of ''[[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]],'' but it was renamed \"The Monsters Are ''On'' Maple Street\". Serling received \"Story By\" credit. It starred [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Will Marshall and [[Titus Welliver]] as Dylan. The difference between the two is that the remake is more about the fear of [[terrorism]]. When the power surge happens in the remake, it is caused, not by aliens, but instead, by the [[Federal government of the United States|government]], specifically the [[United States Army]], experimenting on how small towns react to the fear of terrorism. In the end, the neighborhood takes out its anger and frustration on a family who never left their house after the power surge occurred, thinking that they caused it since they still have power. The residents all fail the test miserably as did all the other inhabitants of every other street they tested.                                                                                              \n\nThe opening and closing narration, provided by [[Forest Whitaker]], has also been altered:\n\n===Opening narration===\n{{cquote|Maple Street, U.S.A.

Maple Street in the last calm and reflective moment - before the monsters came.}}\n\n==Plot==\nMaple Street is full of children playing and adults talking when a shadow passes over, accompanied by a roar and a flash of light. Everyone notices, but they assume \nr]] and quickly resume their activities. The residents soon discover that their power went off, affecting stoves, lawn mowers, cars and phones. They gather in the street to discuss the situation. Pete Van Horn, hammer slung in his bib overalls, volunteers to walk over to Floral Street, the next street over, to see if it is affected as well. His neighbors, Steve Brand and Charlie Farnsworth, decide to go into town, but Tommy, a neighborhood boy, urges them not to go. Tommy has read a story of an [[alien invasion]] causing similar issues, and says that the monsters do not want anyone to leave the street. Tommy adds that in the story, the aliens are living as a family that appears to be human but who are actually scouts, and the power outage that they cause is meant to isolate the neighborhood. The adults are incredulous, assuring him that the cause is natural, perhaps the result of [[sunspots]]. Charlie wonders if Pete Van Horn was successful in making it to Floral Street.\n\nAnother resident, Les Goodman, tries unsuccessfully to start his car. As he is walking over to join the other residents, the car starts by itself. The bizarre behavior of his car, coupled with the fact that, when the situation began, Les did not join in the general speculation, makes the neighbors suspect that Les may be an alien, as suggested by Tommy's story. Charlie says Les had always been an oddball, and suggests they go over and investigate, while Steve asks them to be calm and not act like a mob. As they all gather, conversation turns sinister. One woman brings up Les's late nights spent standing in the garden looking up at the sky, as if waiting or looking for something. Les, defending himself as a resident of Maple Street for 5 years, claims to suffer from [[insomnia]], admonishes his neighbors that they should take caution and not act rashly or allow panic. Steve tries to defuse the situation and prevent it from becoming a [[witch-hunt]].\n\nAs darkness descends, Charlie begins keeping watch over Les Goodman's house. Steve suggests Charlie go home and go to bed. Another neighbor, Don, mentions that Steve has built a [[ham radio]], which Charlie then claims no one has ever seen, the implication being that Steve is secretly talking to aliens. Steve and the other neighbors continue to argue, using each person's idiosyncrasies as evidence that they are an alien. Steve warns that such behavior, looking for a scapegoat, is the surest way for the entire neighborhood to \"eat each other alive\".\n\nA shadowy figure carrying a hammer is seen walking toward them. Tommy exclaims that it is the monster.  Claiming it may be necessary for protection, Don obtains a shotgun which Steve quickly confiscates, insisting that no one is shooting anybody. As the figure gets closer, Charlie panics, grabs the shotgun, and shoots the figure, thinking it is an alien. When the crowd reaches the fallen figure, they realize it is Pete van Horn, returning from his scouting mission on Floral Street, and he is now dead. As Charlie struggles to defend his hasty action, the lights in his house come on. The neighbors voice suspicions that Pete had discovered evidence that Charlie is an alien, and Charlie shot Pete to prevent exposure, and even Steve is too angered by Pete's death to protect Charlie. Charlie makes a run for his house; everyone chases him, throwing stones, one of which hits Charlie in the head creating a bleeding gash. Terrified, Charlie attempts to deflect suspicion onto Tommy. While his mother is quick to defend him, several neighbors agree with this idea, as Tommy was the only one who knew about the aliens' plans. Steve continues to try to defuse the situation, but no one listens.\n\nLights begin flashing on and off in houses throughout the neighborhood; lawn mower and car engines start and stop for no apparent reason. The mob becomes hysterical, hurling accusations, smashing windows and taking up weapons as the situation devolves into an all-out riot.\n\nThe scene cuts to a nearby hilltop, where it is revealed the shadow that flew overhead is, indeed, an alien spaceship. Its crew are watching the riot on Maple Street while using a device to manipulate the neighborhood's power. They comment on how simply fiddling with consistency leads people to descend into paranoia and panic, and that this is a pattern that can be exploited. They also discuss their intention to use this strategy to conquer Earth, one neighborhood at a time. They then ascend a stairway into their spaceship.\n\n==Closing narration==\n{{cquote|The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices...to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill...and suspicion can destroy...and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own \u2013 for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the Twilight Zone.}}\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Claude Akins]] as Steve Brand\n*[[Barry Atwater]] as Les Goodman\n*[[Jack Weston]] as Charlie Farnsworth\n*[[Burt Metcalfe]] as Don Martin\n*[[Jan Handzlik]] as Tommy\n*[[Ben Erway]] as Pete Van Horn\n\n==Production==\nThe aliens are wearing uniforms left over from the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. Also, the mockup set of the retractable stairway, leading into the lower half of the [[C-57D]] cruiser from the same film, is reused for this scene. At the end of the episode, a stock footage effects shot of the cruiser in space can be seen. (The same shot was also used in \"[[Third from the Sun]]\".) This technique was also used in \"[[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|To Serve Man]]\". The cruiser is shown upside down when compared to its orientation in ''Forbidden Planet''.\n\n==2003 Remake==\n{{Infobox television episode\n|title        = The Monsters Are on Maple Street\n|series       = [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]\n|image        = \n|caption      = \n|season       = 1\n|episode      = 32\n|airdate      = February 19, 2003\n|production   = 130\n|writer       = [[Rod Serling]]\n|director     = [[Debbie Allen]]\n|guests       = {{unbulleted list|[[Andrew McCarthy]]|[[Titus Welliver]]}}\n|season_article = \n|episode_list = \n|prev         = [[It's Still a Good Life]]\n|next         = Memphis\n}}\nA 2003 remake of the episode was produced for the 2002 revival of ''[[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]],'' but it was renamed \"The Monsters Are ''On'' Maple Street\". Serling received \"Story By\" credit. It starred [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Will Marshall and [[Titus Welliver]] as Dylan. The difference between the two is that the remake is more about the fear of [[terrorism]]. When the power surge happens in the remake, it is caused, not by aliens, but instead, by the [[Federal government of the United States|government]], specifically the [[United States Army]], experimenting on how small towns react to the fear of terrorism. In the end, the neighborhood takes out its anger and frustration on a family who never left their house after the power surge occurred, thinking that they caused it since they still have power. The residents all fail the test miserably as did all the other inhabitants of every other street they tested.                                                                                              \n\nThe opening and closing narration, provided by [[Forest Whitaker]], has also been altered:\n\n===Opening narration===\n{{cquote|Maple Street, U.S.A.
