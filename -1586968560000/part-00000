They are known in detail from the supplement to the ''[[Shayest ne Shayest]]'', the two ''[[Rivayat]]'' collections, and the two ''Saddar''s.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tower of Silence (Yazd) 006.jpg|thumb|The central pit of the (now-defunct) tower of silence at Yazd, Iran.]]\nThe modern-day towers, which are fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the perimeter being slightly higher than the centre. The roof is divided into three concentric rings: the bodies of men are arranged around the outer ring, women in the second circle, and children in the innermost ring. Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an [[ossuary]] pit at the centre of the tower, where \u2013 assisted by [[Limestone|lime]] \u2013 they gradually disintegrate, and the remaining material \u2013 with run-off rainwater \u2013 runs through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea. The ritual precinct may be entered only by a special class of [[pallbearer]]s, called ''nusessalars'', a contraction of ''nasa.salar'', caretaker (''-salar'') of potential pollutants (''nasa-'').\n\n==In current times==\n\n===In Iran===\n[[File:Torre del silencio, Yazd, Ir\u00e1n, 2016-09-21, DD 65.jpg|thumb|Tower of Silence near [[Yazd]], Iran. The building is no longer in use.]]\n[[File:Doodentoren van de Zoroastri\u00ebrs.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century photograph of an Iranian tower of silence.]]\n\nIn the Iranian Zoroastrian tradition, the towers were built atop hills or low mountains in desert locations distant from population centers. In the early twentieth century, the Iranian Zoroastrians gradually discontinued their use and began to favour burial or [[cremation]].\n\nThe decision to change the system was accelerated by three considerations: the first problem arose with the establishment of the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] medical school. Since Islam considers unnecessary dissection of corpses as a form of mutilation, thus forbidding it, there were no corpses for study available through official channels. The towers were repeatedly broken into, much to the dismay of the Zoroastrian community. Secondly, while the towers had been built away from population centers, the growth of the towns led to the towers now being within city limits. Finally, many of the Zoroastrians found the system outdated. Following long negotiations between the ''anjuman'' societies of [[Yazd]], [[Kerman]], and [[Tehran]], the latter gained a majority and established a cemetery some 10&nbsp;km from Tehran at Ghassr-e Firouzeh (Firouzeh's Palace). The graves were lined with rocks and plastered with cement to prevent direct contact with the earth. In Yazd and Kerman, in addition to cemeteries, orthodox Zoroastrians continued to maintain a tower until the 1970s when ritual exposure was prohibited by law.\n\n===In India===\n[[File:BombayTempleOfSilenceEngraving.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century engraving of a Zoroastrian Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]].]]\nFollowing the rapid expansion of the Indian cities, the squat buildings are today in or near population centers, but separated from the metropolitan bustle by gardens or forests. In [[Parsi people|Parsi]] Zoroastrian tradition, exposure of the dead is also considered to be an individual's final act of charity, providing the birds with what would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nIn the late 20th century and early 21st century the vulture population on the Indian subcontinent declined (see [[Indian vulture crisis]]) by over 97% as of 2008, primarily due to [[diclofenac]] poisoning of the birds following the introduction of that drug for livestock in the 1990s,<ref>{{citation|last=Tait |first=Malcolm |title=India's vulture population is facing catastrophic collapse and with it the sacrosanct corporeal passing of the Parsi dead |date=January 10, 2004 |publisher=The Ecologist |location=London |url=http://www.theecologist.org/archive_detail.asp?content_id=325 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223031/http://www.theecologist.org/archive_detail.asp?content_id=325 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><!-- <ref>{{citation|first=David|last=Adam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,1698681,00.html| title=Cattle drug blamed as India's vultures near extinction|periodical=Guardian Unlimited| date=31 January, 2006|year=2006}}</ref>--> until banned for cattle by the Indian government in 2006.

Vultures used to dispose of a body in minutes, and no other method has proved fully effective.\n\nThe right to use the Towers of Silence is a much-debated issue among the Parsi community (see [[Parsi]] for details). The facilities are usually managed by the ''anjuman''s, the predominantly conservative local Zoroastrian associations (usually having five priests on a nine-member board). In accordance with Indian statutes, these associations have domestic authority over trust properties and have the right to grant or restrict entry and use, with the result that the associations frequently prohibit the use by the offspring of a \"mixed marriage\", that is, where one parent is a Parsi and the other is not.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Seth Modi Hirji Vachha]]\n* [[Sky burial]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"Boyce_RBP\">{{citation |last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce |title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices |publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1979 |pages=156\u2013162}}.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Stausberg\">{{citation|last=Stausberg|first=Michael|chapter=Bestattungsanlagen |pages=204\u2013245 |title=Die Religion Zarathushtras |volume = 3 |year=2004|location=Stuttgart|publisher=[[Kohlhammer Verlag]]}}.</ref>\n}}\n<!-- not used because they deals with the funeral rites, not the towers of silence: \n* {{citation |last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Death among Zoroastrians|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|volume=7.2|year=1996|location=Cosa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v7f2/v7f263.html}}\n-->\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Towers of Silence}}\n{{refbegin}} \n* [http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd5sbe.htm ''Vendidad'' Fargard 5, Purity Laws], as translated by [[James Darmesteter]].\n* [http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/07/21/stories/2002072100130200.htm Extracts] from\n** {{citation|last=Wadia|first=Azmi|chapter=Evolution of the Towers of Silence and their Significance|editor-last=Godrej|editor-first=Pheroza J.|editor2-last=Mistree|editor2-first=Firoza Punthakey|title=A Zoroastrian Tapestry|location=New York|publisher=Mapin|year=2002}}\n** {{citation|last=Kotwal|first=Firoze M.|last2=Mistree|first2=Khojeste P.|chapter=Protecting the Physical World|pages=337\u2013365|editor-last=Godrej|editor-first=Pheroza J.|editor2-last=Mistree|editor2-first=Firoza Punthakey|title=A Zoroastrian Tapestry|location=New York|publisher=Mapin|year=2002}}\n* Lucarelli, Fosco [https://web.archive.org/web/20161119174530/http://socks-studio.com/2012/02/09/towers-of-silence-zoroastrian-architectures-for-the-ritual-of-death/ \"Towers of Silence: Zoroastrian Architectures for the Ritual of Death\"], \"Socks-Studio\",Feb 9, 2012\n* Harris, Gardiner [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/world/asia/cultivating-vultures-to-restore-a-mumbai-ritual.html \"Giving New Life to Vultures to Restore a Human Ritual of Death\"], \"The New York Times\", Nov 29, 2012\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Zoroastrianism]]\n[[Category:Death customs]]\n[[Category:Towers in India]]\n[[Category:Towers in Iran]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Iran]]\n[[Category:Religion and death]]\n[[Category:Persian words and phrases]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Zoroastrian burial structure}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n{{Zoroastrianism}}\n[[File:Interior view of Tower of Silence.jpg|thumb|350px|Interior view of Dakhma]]\n[[File:Parsee Tower of Silence, Bombay.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century drawing of the Dakhma on Malabar Hill, Bombay.]]\n[[File:Tower of Silence, Mumbai 12.JPG|thumb|The Malabar Hill Tower of Silence today.]]\n\nA '''Dakhma''' ([[Persian language| Persian]]: \u062f\u062e\u0645\u0647), also known as the '''Tower of Silence''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0634\u06cc), is a circular, raised structure built by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] for [[excarnation]] \u2013 that is, for dead bodies to be exposed to [[Scavenger|carrion birds]], usually [[Old World vulture|vultures]].\n\nZoroastrian exposure of the dead is first attested in the amid of the -5th century BC [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'' of Herodotus]], but the use of towers is first documented in the early [[9th century CE]].<ref name=\"Boyce_RBP\" />{{rp|156\u2013162}} The doctrinal rationale for exposure is to avoid contact with [[Zam|Earth]] or [[Atar|Fire]], both of which are considered sacred in the Zoroastrian religion.\n\nOne of the earliest literary descriptions of such a building appears in the late 9th-century ''Epistles of Manushchihr'', where the technical term is ''astodan'', \"ossuary\".<ref name=\"Stausberg\" />{{rp|205}} Another technical term that appears in the 9th/10th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (the so-called [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi books]]) is ''dakhmag'', for any place for the dead.<ref name=\"Stausberg\" />{{rp|206}} \n\n\n== Etymology == \nThis [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian]] term is a borrowing from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''dakhma'', of uncertain meaning but related to interment and commonly translated as \"grave\".

However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-iii|title=HERODOTUS iii.

They are known in detail from the supplement to the ''[[Shayest ne Shayest]]'', the two ''[[Rivayat]]'' collections, and the two ''Saddar''s.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tower of Silence (Yazd) 006.jpg|thumb|The central pit of the (now-defunct) tower of silence at Yazd, Iran.]]\nThe modern-day towers, which are fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the perimeter being slightly higher than the centre. The roof is divided into three concentric rings: the bodies of men are arranged around the outer ring, women in the second circle, and children in the innermost ring. Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an [[ossuary]] pit at the centre of the tower, where \u2013 assisted by [[Limestone|lime]] \u2013 they gradually disintegrate, and the remaining material \u2013 with run-off rainwater \u2013 runs through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea. The ritual precinct may be entered only by a special class of [[pallbearer]]s, called ''nusessalars'', a contraction of ''nasa.salar'', caretaker (''-salar'') of potential pollutants (''nasa-'').\n\n==In current times==\n\n===In Iran===\n[[File:Torre del silencio, Yazd, Ir\u00e1n, 2016-09-21, DD 65.jpg|thumb|Tower of Silence near [[Yazd]], Iran. The building is no longer in use.]]\n[[File:Doodentoren van de Zoroastri\u00ebrs.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century photograph of an Iranian tower of silence.]]\n\nIn the Iranian Zoroastrian tradition, the towers were built atop hills or low mountains in desert locations distant from population centers. In the early twentieth century, the Iranian Zoroastrians gradually discontinued their use and began to favour burial or [[cremation]].\n\nThe decision to change the system was accelerated by three considerations: the first problem arose with the establishment of the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] medical school. Since Islam considers unnecessary dissection of corpses as a form of mutilation, thus forbidding it, there were no corpses for study available through official channels. The towers were repeatedly broken into, much to the dismay of the Zoroastrian community. Secondly, while the towers had been built away from population centers, the growth of the towns led to the towers now being within city limits. Finally, many of the Zoroastrians found the system outdated. Following long negotiations between the ''anjuman'' societies of [[Yazd]], [[Kerman]], and [[Tehran]], the latter gained a majority and established a cemetery some 10&nbsp;km from Tehran at Ghassr-e Firouzeh (Firouzeh's Palace). The graves were lined with rocks and plastered with cement to prevent direct contact with the earth. In Yazd and Kerman, in addition to cemeteries, orthodox Zoroastrians continued to maintain a tower until the 1970s when ritual exposure was prohibited by law.\n\n===In India===\n[[File:BombayTempleOfSilenceEngraving.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century engraving of a Zoroastrian Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]].]]\nFollowing the rapid expansion of the Indian cities, the squat buildings are today in or near population centers, but separated from the metropolitan bustle by gardens or forests. In [[Parsi people|Parsi]] Zoroastrian tradition, exposure of the dead is also considered to be an individual's final act of charity, providing the birds with what would otherwise be destroyed.\n\nIn the late 20th century and early 21st century the vulture population on the Indian subcontinent declined (see [[Indian vulture crisis]]) by over 97% as of 2008, primarily due to [[diclofenac]] poisoning of the birds following the introduction of that drug for livestock in the 1990s,<ref>{{citation|last=Tait |first=Malcolm |title=India's vulture population is facing catastrophic collapse and with it the sacrosanct corporeal passing of the Parsi dead |date=January 10, 2004 |publisher=The Ecologist |location=London |url=http://www.theecologist.org/archive_detail.asp?content_id=325 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223031/http://www.theecologist.org/archive_detail.asp?content_id=325 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><!-- <ref>{{citation|first=David|last=Adam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,1698681,00.html| title=Cattle drug blamed as India's vultures near extinction|periodical=Guardian Unlimited| date=31 January, 2006|year=2006}}</ref>--> until banned for cattle by the Indian government in 2006.

Vultures used to dispose of a body in minutes, and no other method has proved fully effective.\n\nThe right to use the Towers of Silence is a much-debated issue among the Parsi community (see [[Parsi]] for details). The facilities are usually managed by the ''anjuman''s, the predominantly conservative local Zoroastrian associations (usually having five priests on a nine-member board). In accordance with Indian statutes, these associations have domestic authority over trust properties and have the right to grant or restrict entry and use, with the result that the associations frequently prohibit the use by the offspring of a \"mixed marriage\", that is, where one parent is a Parsi and the other is not.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Seth Modi Hirji Vachha]]\n* [[Sky burial]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"Boyce_RBP\">{{citation |last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce |title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices |publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1979 |pages=156\u2013162}}.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Stausberg\">{{citation|last=Stausberg|first=Michael|chapter=Bestattungsanlagen |pages=204\u2013245 |title=Die Religion Zarathushtras |volume = 3 |year=2004|location=Stuttgart|publisher=[[Kohlhammer Verlag]]}}.</ref>\n}}\n<!-- not used because they deals with the funeral rites, not the towers of silence: \n* {{citation |last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Death among Zoroastrians|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|volume=7.2|year=1996|location=Cosa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v7f2/v7f263.html}}\n-->\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Towers of Silence}}\n{{refbegin}} \n* [http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd5sbe.htm ''Vendidad'' Fargard 5, Purity Laws], as translated by [[James Darmesteter]].\n* [http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/07/21/stories/2002072100130200.htm Extracts] from\n** {{citation|last=Wadia|first=Azmi|chapter=Evolution of the Towers of Silence and their Significance|editor-last=Godrej|editor-first=Pheroza J.|editor2-last=Mistree|editor2-first=Firoza Punthakey|title=A Zoroastrian Tapestry|location=New York|publisher=Mapin|year=2002}}\n** {{citation|last=Kotwal|first=Firoze M.|last2=Mistree|first2=Khojeste P.|chapter=Protecting the Physical World|pages=337\u2013365|editor-last=Godrej|editor-first=Pheroza J.|editor2-last=Mistree|editor2-first=Firoza Punthakey|title=A Zoroastrian Tapestry|location=New York|publisher=Mapin|year=2002}}\n* Lucarelli, Fosco [https://web.archive.org/web/20161119174530/http://socks-studio.com/2012/02/09/towers-of-silence-zoroastrian-architectures-for-the-ritual-of-death/ \"Towers of Silence: Zoroastrian Architectures for the Ritual of Death\"], \"Socks-Studio\",Feb 9, 2012\n* Harris, Gardiner [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/world/asia/cultivating-vultures-to-restore-a-mumbai-ritual.html \"Giving New Life to Vultures to Restore a Human Ritual of Death\"], \"The New York Times\", Nov 29, 2012\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Zoroastrianism]]\n[[Category:Death customs]]\n[[Category:Towers in India]]\n[[Category:Towers in Iran]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Iran]]\n[[Category:Religion and death]]\n[[Category:Persian words and phrases]]\n", "name_user": "Hibernian", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Silence"}

Most of the rest of the building is [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], from the 13th century.

There are remains of the vaults of the [[Palace|episcopal palace]] to the south of the cathedral.  Technically, it is no longer a [[cathedral]], as there are no bishops in the Church of Scotland, which is a [[Presbyterian]] denomination. After the abolition of prelacy, the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] became the parish church but the nave fell out of use, and its roof had fallen in by about 1600. \n\nIt contains the graves of [[Margaret Drummond (mistress)|Margaret Drummond]] of [[Stobhall]], a mistress of King [[James IV of Scotland]] and her two sisters, all said to have been poisoned.\n\nUnusually, the building is owned by [[the Crown]], and is looked after by [[Historic Scotland]] rather than the church governance; there is no entrance charge.\n\nThe building is largely 13th century in date, though it incorporates an originally freestanding bell-tower (like the  example at [[Muthill]]) of 11th century date on its south side.  This tower was increased in height in the 15th century, a change clearly visible in the colour of the stonework, and in the late Gothic style of the upper storey's windows.\n\nThe choir is unaisled, but has a long vaulted chamber which served as [[chapter house]] and [[sacristy]] on its north side.  The choir contains the mural tomb of the Cathedral's founder, [[Clement of Dunblane|Bishop Clement]].  Many of the 15th century choir stalls, which have carved [[misericord]]s (including one with an unusual depiction of a bat) are preserved within the choir.  Further, more elaborate, canopied stalls are preserved at the west end of the nave.  Dunblane has the largest surviving collection of medieval Scottish ecclesiastical woodwork after [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College Chapel, Aberdeen]].  Some detached fragments are displayed in the town's museum.\n\nThe cathedral was restored in the late 19th century under the control of Rev Alexander Ritchie DD, who commissioned architect [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] to oversee the works, with these works completed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] in 1912.<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\n==Burials==\nPreserved within the arcaded nave are two early Christian stones, a cross-slab and a possible architectural frieze, survivals from an early medieval church on the same site, founded by or dedicated to the 'Blane' whose name is commemorated in the name of the town.\n\nDunblane Cathedral churchyard contains two [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|war graves]], including that of William Stirling, a [[Gunner (artillery)|gunner]] in the [[Royal Marine Artillery]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=cwgc>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2753544/STIRLING,%20WILLIAM|title=Gunner STIRLING, WILLIAM|website=Cwgc.org|accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Monuments of interest==\n*Bishop [[Clement of Dunblane]] (d.1258)\n*[[James Finlayson (minister)|Rev James Finlayson]] DD (1758-1808)\n*[[David Russell (British Army officer)|Sir David Russell]] (1809-1884)\n*[[James Stirling (mathematician)]] (1690-1770) and the Stirlings of Garden\n*John Stirling of Kippendavie (d.1812) by [[Peter Turnerelli]]\n*[[Jane Stirling]] (1804-1859) daughter of the above\n\n==Dunblane Commemoration==\nIn the nave of the Cathedral is a [[standing stone]] by the monumental sculptor [[Richard Kindersley]] which commemorates the events of 13 March 1996 \u2013 the [[Dunblane Massacre]].

There are remains of the vaults of the [[Palace|episcopal palace]] to the south of the cathedral.  Technically, it is no longer a [[cathedral]], as there are no bishops in the Church of Scotland, which is a [[Presbyterian]] denomination. [[William Chisholm (II)|William Chisholm]], the last [[Catholic]] bishop of Dunblane, later became [[bishop of Vaison]] in France. After the Reformation, the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] became the parish church but the nave fell out of use, and its roof had fallen in by about 1600. \n\nIt contains the graves of [[Margaret Drummond (mistress)|Margaret Drummond]] of [[Stobhall]], a mistress of King [[James IV of Scotland]] and her two sisters, all said to have been poisoned.\n\nUnusually, the building is owned by [[the Crown]], and is looked after by [[Historic Scotland]] rather than the church governance; there is no entrance charge.\n\nThe building is largely 13th century in date, though it incorporates an originally freestanding bell-tower (like the  example at [[Muthill]]) of 11th century date on its south side.  This tower was increased in height in the 15th century, a change clearly visible in the colour of the stonework, and in the late Gothic style of the upper storey's windows.\n\nThe choir is unaisled, but has a long vaulted chamber which served as [[chapter house]] and [[sacristy]] on its north side.  The choir contains the mural tomb of the Cathedral's founder, [[Clement of Dunblane|Bishop Clement]].  Many of the 15th century choir stalls, which have carved [[misericord]]s (including one with an unusual depiction of a bat) are preserved within the choir.  Further, more elaborate, canopied stalls are preserved at the west end of the nave.  Dunblane has the largest surviving collection of medieval Scottish ecclesiastical woodwork after [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College Chapel, Aberdeen]].  Some detached fragments are displayed in the town's museum.\n\nThe cathedral was restored in the late 19th century under the control of Rev Alexander Ritchie DD, who commissioned architect [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] to oversee the works, with these works completed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] in 1912.<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\n==Burials==\nPreserved within the arcaded nave are two early Christian stones, a cross-slab and a possible architectural frieze, survivals from an early medieval church on the same site, founded by or dedicated to the 'Blane' whose name is commemorated in the name of the town.\n\nDunblane Cathedral churchyard contains two [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|war graves]], including that of William Stirling, a [[Gunner (artillery)|gunner]] in the [[Royal Marine Artillery]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=cwgc>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2753544/STIRLING,%20WILLIAM|title=Gunner STIRLING, WILLIAM|website=Cwgc.org|accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Monuments of interest==\n*Bishop [[Clement of Dunblane]] (d.1258)\n*[[James Finlayson (minister)|Rev James Finlayson]] DD (1758-1808)\n*[[David Russell (British Army officer)|Sir David Russell]] (1809-1884)\n*[[James Stirling (mathematician)]] (1690-1770) and the Stirlings of Garden\n*John Stirling of Kippendavie (d.1812) by [[Peter Turnerelli]]\n*[[Jane Stirling]] (1804-1859) daughter of the above\n\n==Dunblane Commemoration==\nIn the nave of the Cathedral is a [[standing stone]] by the monumental sculptor [[Richard Kindersley]] which commemorates the events of 13 March 1996 \u2013 the [[Dunblane Massacre]].
