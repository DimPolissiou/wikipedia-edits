{"title_page": "Distribution (marketing)", "text_new": "{{About|marketing distribution strategies|goods distribution|business logistics}}\n{{marketing}}\n[[File:Forklift.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Warehouses are used to store goods that are being distributed.]]\n'''Distribution''' (or '''place''') is one of the four elements of the [[marketing mix]]. Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for the consumer or business user who needs it. This can be done directly by the producer or service provider, or using indirect channels with distributors or [[intermediaries]]. The other three elements of the [[marketing mix]] are [[Product (business)|product]], [[pricing]], and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].\n\nDecisions about distribution need to be taken in line with a company's overall strategic [[Vision statement|vision]] and [[Mission statement|mission]]. Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of [[strategic planning]]. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall distribution channel should add value to the consumer.\n\n==Definition==\n\nDistribution is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that products reach target customers in the most direct and cost efficient manner. In the case of services, distribution is principally concerned with access.<ref>Dent, J., ''Distribution Channels: Understanding and Managing Channels to Market,'' Kogan Page, 2011, Chapter 1</ref> Although distribution, as a concept, is relatively simple, in practice distribution management may involve a diverse range of activities and disciplines including: detailed logistics, transportation, warehousing, storage, inventory management as well as channel management including selection of channel members and rewarding distributors.<ref>Armstrong,G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Sydney, Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 297-394</ref>\n\n==Distribution strategies==\nPrior to designing a distribution system, the planner needs to determine what the [[marketing channel|distribution channel]] is to achieve in broad terms.  The overall approach to distributing products or services depends on a number of factors including the type of product, especially perishability; the market served; the geographic scope of operations and the firm's overall mission and vision. The process of setting out a broad statement of the aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.\n\n[[File:Target2398.jpg|thumb|In an intensive distribution approach, the marketer relies on chain stores to reach broad markets in a cost efficient manner.]]\n\nStrategically, there are three approaches to distribution:<ref>Wright, R., ''Marketing: Origins, Concepts, Environment,'' Holborn, London, Thomson Learning, 1999, pp 250-251</ref>\n\n* ''Mass distribution'' (also known as ''intensive distribution''): When products are destined for a mass market, the marketer will seek out intermediaries that appeal to a broad market base. For example, snack foods and drinks are sold via a wide variety of outlets including supermarkets, [[convenience store]]s, [[vending machine]]s, [[cafeteria]]s and others. The choice of distribution outlet is skewed towards those than can deliver mass markets in a cost efficient manner.\n* ''Selective distribution:'' A manufacturer may choose to restrict the number of outlets handling a product. For example, a manufacturer of premium electrical goods may choose to deal with department stores and independent outlets that can provide added value service level required to support the product. Dr Scholl orthopedic sandals, for example, only sell their product through pharmacies because this type of intermediary supports the desired ''therapeutic'' positioning of the product. Some of the prestige brands of cosmetics and skincare, such as Estee Lauder, Jurlique and Clinique, insist that sales staff are trained to use the product range. The manufacturer will only allow trained clinicians to sell their products.\n* ''Exclusive distribution:'' In an exclusive distribution approach, a manufacturer chooses to deal with one intermediary or one type of intermediary. The advantage of an exclusive approach is that the manufacturer retains greater control over the distribution process. In exclusive arrangements, the distributor is expected to work closely with the manufacturer and add value to the product through service level, after sales care or client support services. Another definition of exclusive arrangement is an agreement between a supplier and a retailer granting the retailer exclusive rights within a specific geographic area to carry the supplier's product.<ref>Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/exclusive-distribution.html</ref>\n\n'''Summary of strategic approaches to distribution'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Approach\n! Definition\n|-\n| Intensive distribution\n| The producer's products are stocked in the majority of outlets.<ref name=kotler>Kotler, Keller and Burton, 2009. Marketing Management, Pearson Education Australia: Frenchs Forest</ref>  This strategy is common for mass-produced products such as basic supplies, snack foods, magazines and soft drink beverages.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/intensive-distribution/ |title=Intensive Distribution: Definition, Strategy & Examples |date=June 26, 2015 |publisher=Inevitable Steps |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| Selective distribution\n| The producer relies on a few intermediaries to carry their product.<ref name=\"kotler\" />  This strategy is commonly observed for more specialised goods that are carried through specialist dealers, for example, brands of craft tools, or large appliances.\n|-\n| Exclusive distribution\n|The producer selects only very few intermediaries.<ref name=\"kotler\" />  Exclusive distribution occurs where the seller agrees to allow a single retailer the right to sell the manufacturer's products.  This strategy is typical of luxury goods retailers such as Gucci.\n|}\n\n===Push vs pull strategy ===\n\nIn consumer markets, another key strategic level decision is whether to use a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.<ref>Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.</ref>  The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy, the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions, and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.<ref>Varey, E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295</ref>\n\n==Channels and intermediaries==\n[[File:Wholesale fish market at Haikou New Port - 14.jpg|thumb|A wholesale fish market at Haikou, New Port]]\n\nDistribution of products takes place by means of a [[marketing channel]], also known as a distribution channel.  A marketing channel is the people, organizations, and activities necessary to transfer the ownership of goods from the point of production to the point of consumption. It is the way products get to the end-user, the consumer. This is mostly accomplished through merchant retailers or wholesalers or, in the international context, by importers. In certain specialist markets, agents or brokers may become involved in the marketing channel.\n\nTypical intermediaries involved in distribution include:\n\n* '''Wholesaler:''' A merchant intermediary who sells chiefly to retailers, other merchants, or industrial, institutional, and commercial users mainly for resale or business use. The transactions are B2B (Business to Business). Wholesalers typically sell in large quantities. (Wholesalers, by definition, do not deal directly with the public).<ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wholesaler</ref>\n* '''Retailer:''' A merchant intermediary who sells direct to the public. There are many different types of retail outlet - from hypermarts and supermarkets to small, independent stores. The transactions in this case are B2C (Business to Customer).\n* '''Agent:''' An intermediary who is authorized to act for a principal in order to facilitate exchange. Unlike merchant wholesalers and retailers, agents do not take title to goods, but simply put buyers and sellers together. Agents are typically paid via commissions by the principal. For example, travel agents are paid a commission of around 15% for each booking made with an airline or hotel operator.\n* '''Jobber:''' A special type of wholesaler, typically one who operates on a small scale and sells only to retailers or institutions. For example, rack jobbers are small independent wholesalers who operate from a truck, supplying convenience stores with snack foods and drinks on a regular basis.<ref>Merriam- Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jobber</ref>\n\n==Channel design==\n\n[[File:Distribution-levels.jpg|thumb|Types of distribution systems]]\n\nA firm can design any number of channels they require to reach customers efficiently and effectively.  Channels can be distinguished by the number of intermediaries between producer and consumer.<ref name=kotler/> If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a ''zero-level'' distribution system or [[direct marketing]]. A ''level one'' (sometimes called ''one-tier'') channel has a single intermediary. A ''level two'' (alternatively a ''two-tier'') channel has two intermediaries, and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.\n\n==Channel mix==\nIn practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; a direct sales force may call on larger customers may be complemented with agents to cover smaller customers and prospects. When a single organisation uses a variety of different channels to reach its markets, this is known as a ''multi-channel'' distribution network. In addition, online retailing or [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] is leading to [[disintermediation]], the removal of intermediaries from a supply chain.  Retailing via smartphone or m-commerce is also a growth area.\ne commerce is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the internet. electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic fund transfer , supply chain management, internet marketing, electronic data interchange[EDI],inventory management systems.\ne-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the largest sector of the electronic industry.\n\n==Managing channels==\nThe firm's marketing department needs to design the most suitable channels for the firm's products, then select appropriate channel members or intermediaries.  An organisation may need to train staff of intermediaries and motivate the intermediary to sell the firm's products.  The firm should monitor the channel's performance over time and modify the channel to enhance performance.\n\n===Channel motivation===\n[[File:London, Harrods (2).JPG|thumb|Harrod's food hall, a major retailer in London]]\nTo motivate intermediaries the firm can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display.<ref name=kotler/>  On the other hand, negative actions may be necessary, such as threatening to cut back on margin, or hold back delivery of product. Care must be exercised when considering negative actions as these may fall foul of regulations and can contribute to a public backlash and a public relations disaster.\n\n===Channel conflict===\nChannel conflict can arise when one intermediary's actions prevent another intermediary from achieving their objectives.<ref name=kotler/> Vertical channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel, and horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain.<ref>Murphy, P.E., \"George E Brenkert - Marketing Ethics,\" book review, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,'' 24 May 2009 http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/marketing-ethics/</ref>\n\n==Trends in distribution==\n\n===Channel switching===\n\n[[File:Inside a new officeworks store.jpg|thumb|right|The advent of \"category killers\", such as Australia's Officeworks, has contributed to an increase in channel switching behaviour.]]\n\nChannel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching from one type of channel intermediary to a different type of intermediary for their purchases. Examples include switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues and e-commerce providers; switching from grocery stores to convenience stores or switching from top tier department stores to mass market discount outlets.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/5598/research.pdf|title=Explaining Consumers' Channel-Switching Behavior Using the Theory of Planned Behavior|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of [[Category killer]]s (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal or statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, \"How Vital are Vitamins:, Research Finding No. 5503, Media Release, 14 March 2014 online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5503-how-vital-are-vitamins-201403252241</ref>\n\nFor the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found at cheaper prices, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping).<ref>Reardon, J., McCorkle, D.E. \"A Consumer Model for Channel Switching Behavior\", ''International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management'', Vol. 30, no. 4, pp.179 - 185</ref> As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.<ref>Dholakia1, R.R., Zhao, M. and Dholakia, N., \"Multichannel retailing: A case study of early experiences.,\" ''Journal of Interactive Marketing'', vol. 19, March, 2009, pp 63\u201374, DOI: 10.1002/dir.20035</ref>\n\n===Customer value===\n\nThe emergence of a [[service-dominant logic]] perspective has focussed scholarly attention on how distribution networks serve to create customer value and to consider how value is co-created by all the players within the distribution chain, including the value created by customers themselves.<ref>Flint, D. J., and Mentzer, J. T., \"Striving for Integrated Value Chain Management Given a Service-dominant Logic for Marketing,\" In R. F. Lusch and S. L. Vargo (Eds.), ''The Service-dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialog, Debate, and Directions,'' Armonk, New York, ME Sharpe, 2006, pp 139\u2013149; Tokman, M., and Beitelspacher, L.

M., ''Co-creating Logistics Value: A Service-Dominant Logic Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Logistics Management,'' Vol. 21, no. 3, 2010, pp 375-403.</ref> This emphasis on value-creation is contributing to a change in terminology surrounding distribution processes; \"distribution networks\" are often termed ''value-chains'' while \"distribution centres\" are often termed ''customer fulfillment centres.'' For example, the retail giant Amazon, which utilises both direct online distribution alongside bricks and mortar stores, now calls its despatch centres \"customer fulfillment centres\".<ref>Murphy, J., \"Amazon is Coming to Australia, and if these Projections are Correct, it\u2019s Arrival is Going to be Massive,\" ''News.com,'' 29 April 2017; Pearce, L., \u201cAmazon: Everything You Need to Know about its Plans for Australia,\u201d ''Huffington Post,'' 22 August 2017</ref> Although the term, \"customer fulfillment centre\" has been criticised on the grounds that it is a [[neologism]], its use is becoming increasingly mainstream as it slowly makes its way into introductory marketing textbooks.<ref>See for example, \"Placement: Customer Value Fulfilment,\" Chapter 10 in Gary Armstrong, Stewart Adam, Sara Denize, and Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014</ref>\n\n===Disintermediation===\n\nDisintermediation occurs when manufacturers or service providers eliminate intermediaries from the distribution network and deal directly with purchasers. Disintermediation is found in industries where radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional distributors. The widespread public acceptance of online shopping has been a major trigger for disintermediation in some industries. Certain types of traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside.<ref>Armstrong, G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 315-316</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Lists of distribution companies]]\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[All commodity volume]]\n* [[Cargo]]\n* [[Distribution (economics)]]\n* [[Distribution resource planning]]\n* [[Document automation]] in supply chain management and logistics\n* [[Extended enterprise]]\n* [[Good distribution practice]] (GDP)\n* [[Liquid logistics]]\n* [[Logistics]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Retail]]\n* [[Value chain]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value proposition]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Marketing}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163821/http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/rskidmore/Ghost/library/Chapters/CHPT15-04.pdf pierce college.edu PDF, Product Distribution]\n*[http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/term/82250.html entrepreneur.com Distribution Models]\n*[http://www.allianceexperts.com/en/knowledge/difference-between-an-agent-distributor-and-franchisor/ Difference between an agent, distributor and franchise]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Distribution (marketing)| ]]\n[[Category:Business terms]]\n[[Category:Service industries]]\n[[Category:Trade]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|marketing distribution strategies|goods distribution|business logistics}}\n{{marketing}}\n[[File:Forklift.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Warehouses are used to store goods that are being distributed.]]\n'''Distribution''' (or '''place''') is one of the four elements of the [[marketing mix]].

The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall distribution channel should add value to the consumer.\n\n==Definition==\n\nDistribution is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that products reach target customers in the most direct and cost efficient manner. In the case of services, distribution is principally concerned with access.<ref>Dent, J., ''Distribution Channels: Understanding and Managing Channels to Market,'' Kogan Page, 2011, Chapter 1</ref> Although distribution, as a concept, is relatively simple, in practice distribution management may involve a diverse range of activities and disciplines including: detailed logistics, transportation, warehousing, storage, inventory management as well as channel management including selection of channel members and rewarding distributors.<ref>Armstrong,G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Sydney, Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 297-394</ref>\n\n==Distribution strategies==\nPrior to designing a distribution system, the planner needs to determine what the [[marketing channel|distribution channel]] is to achieve in broad terms.  The overall approach to distributing products or services depends on a number of factors including the type of product, especially perishability; the market served; the geographic scope of operations and the firm's overall mission and vision. The process of setting out a broad statement of the aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.\n\n[[File:Target2398.jpg|thumb|In an intensive distribution approach, the marketer relies on chain stores to reach broad markets in a cost efficient manner.]]\n\nStrategically, there are three approaches to distribution:<ref>Wright, R., ''Marketing: Origins, Concepts, Environment,'' Holborn, London, Thomson Learning, 1999, pp 250-251</ref>\n\n* ''Mass distribution'' (also known as ''intensive distribution''): When products are destined for a mass market, the marketer will seek out intermediaries that appeal to a broad market base. For example, snack foods and drinks are sold via a wide variety of outlets including supermarkets, [[convenience store]]s, [[vending machine]]s, [[cafeteria]]s and others. The choice of distribution outlet is skewed towards those than can deliver mass markets in a cost efficient manner.\n* ''Selective distribution:'' A manufacturer may choose to restrict the number of outlets handling a product. For example, a manufacturer of premium electrical goods may choose to deal with department stores and independent outlets that can provide added value service level required to support the product. Dr Scholl orthopedic sandals, for example, only sell their product through pharmacies because this type of intermediary supports the desired ''therapeutic'' positioning of the product. Some of the prestige brands of cosmetics and skincare, such as Estee Lauder, Jurlique and Clinique, insist that sales staff are trained to use the product range. The manufacturer will only allow trained clinicians to sell their products.\n* ''Exclusive distribution:'' In an exclusive distribution approach, a manufacturer chooses to deal with one intermediary or one type of intermediary. The advantage of an exclusive approach is that the manufacturer retains greater control over the distribution process. In exclusive arrangements, the distributor is expected to work closely with the manufacturer and add value to the product through service level, after sales care or client support services. Another definition of exclusive arrangement is an agreement between a supplier and a retailer granting the retailer exclusive rights within a specific geographic area to carry the supplier's product.<ref>Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/exclusive-distribution.html</ref>\n\n'''Summary of strategic approaches to distribution'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Approach\n! Definition\n|-\n| Intensive distribution\n| The producer's products are stocked in the majority of outlets.<ref name=kotler>Kotler, Keller and Burton, 2009.

This strategy is typical of luxury goods retailers such as Gucci.\n|}\n\n===Push vs pull strategy ===\n\nIn consumer markets, another key strategic level decision is whether to use a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.<ref>Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.</ref>  The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy, the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions, and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.<ref>Varey, E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295</ref>\n\n==Channels and intermediaries==\n[[File:Wholesale fish market at Haikou New Port - 14.jpg|thumb|A wholesale fish market at Haikou, New Port]]\n\nDistribution of products takes place by means of a [[marketing channel]], also known as a distribution channel.  A marketing channel is the people, organizations, and activities necessary to transfer the ownership of goods from the point of production to the point of consumption. It is the way products get to the end-user, the consumer. This is mostly accomplished through merchant retailers or wholesalers or, in the international context, by importers. In certain specialist markets, agents or brokers may become involved in the marketing channel.\n\nTypical intermediaries involved in distribution include:\n\n* '''Wholesaler:''' A merchant intermediary who sells chiefly to retailers, other merchants, or industrial, institutional, and commercial users mainly for resale or business use. The transactions are B2B (Business to Business). Wholesalers typically sell in large quantities. (Wholesalers, by definition, do not deal directly with the public).<ref>Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wholesaler</ref>\n* '''Retailer:''' A merchant intermediary who sells direct to the public. There are many different types of retail outlet - from hypermarts and supermarkets to small, independent stores. The transactions in this case are B2C (Business to Customer).\n* '''Agent:''' An intermediary who is authorized to act for a principal in order to facilitate exchange. Unlike merchant wholesalers and retailers, agents do not take title to goods, but simply put buyers and sellers together. Agents are typically paid via commissions by the principal. For example, travel agents are paid a commission of around 15% for each booking made with an airline or hotel operator.\n* '''Jobber:''' A special type of wholesaler, typically one who operates on a small scale and sells only to retailers or institutions. For example, rack jobbers are small independent wholesalers who operate from a truck, supplying convenience stores with snack foods and drinks on a regular basis.<ref>Merriam- Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jobber</ref>\n\n==Channel design==\n\n[[File:Distribution-levels.jpg|thumb|Types of distribution systems]]\n\nA firm can design any number of channels they require to reach customers efficiently and effectively.  Channels can be distinguished by the number of intermediaries between producer and consumer.<ref name=kotler/> If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a ''zero-level'' distribution system or [[direct marketing]]. A ''level one'' (sometimes called ''one-tier'') channel has a single intermediary. A ''level two'' (alternatively a ''two-tier'') channel has two intermediaries, and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.\n\n==Channel mix==\nIn practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; a direct sales force may call on larger customers may be complemented with agents to cover smaller customers and prospects. When a single organisation uses a variety of different channels to reach its markets, this is known as a ''multi-channel'' distribution network. In addition, online retailing or [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] is leading to [[disintermediation]], the removal of intermediaries from a supply chain.  Retailing via smartphone or m-commerce is also a growth area.\n\n==Managing channels==\nThe firm's marketing department needs to design the most suitable channels for the firm's products, then select appropriate channel members or intermediaries.  An organisation may need to train staff of intermediaries and motivate the intermediary to sell the firm's products.  The firm should monitor the channel's performance over time and modify the channel to enhance performance.\n\n===Channel motivation===\n[[File:London, Harrods (2).JPG|thumb|Harrod's food hall, a major retailer in London]]\nTo motivate intermediaries the firm can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display.<ref name=kotler/>  On the other hand, negative actions may be necessary, such as threatening to cut back on margin, or hold back delivery of product. Care must be exercised when considering negative actions as these may fall foul of regulations and can contribute to a public backlash and a public relations disaster.\n\n===Channel conflict===\nChannel conflict can arise when one intermediary's actions prevent another intermediary from achieving their objectives.<ref name=kotler/> Vertical channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel, and horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain.<ref>Murphy, P.E., \"George E Brenkert - Marketing Ethics,\" book review, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,'' 24 May 2009 http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/marketing-ethics/</ref>\n\n==Trends in distribution==\n\n===Channel switching===\n\n[[File:Inside a new officeworks store.jpg|thumb|right|The advent of \"category killers\", such as Australia's Officeworks, has contributed to an increase in channel switching behaviour.]]\n\nChannel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching from one type of channel intermediary to a different type of intermediary for their purchases. Examples include switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues and e-commerce providers; switching from grocery stores to convenience stores or switching from top tier department stores to mass market discount outlets.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/5598/research.pdf|title=Explaining Consumers' Channel-Switching Behavior Using the Theory of Planned Behavior|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of [[Category killer]]s (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal or statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, \"How Vital are Vitamins:, Research Finding No. 5503, Media Release, 14 March 2014 online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5503-how-vital-are-vitamins-201403252241</ref>\n\nFor the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found at cheaper prices, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping).<ref>Reardon, J., McCorkle, D.E. \"A Consumer Model for Channel Switching Behavior\", ''International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management'', Vol. 30, no. 4, pp.179 - 185</ref> As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.<ref>Dholakia1, R.R., Zhao, M. and Dholakia, N., \"Multichannel retailing: A case study of early experiences.,\" ''Journal of Interactive Marketing'', vol. 19, March, 2009, pp 63\u201374, DOI: 10.1002/dir.20035</ref>\n\n===Customer value===\n\nThe emergence of a [[service-dominant logic]] perspective has focussed scholarly attention on how distribution networks serve to create customer value and to consider how value is co-created by all the players within the distribution chain, including the value created by customers themselves.<ref>Flint, D. J., and Mentzer, J. T., \"Striving for Integrated Value Chain Management Given a Service-dominant Logic for Marketing,\" In R. F. Lusch and S. L. Vargo (Eds.), ''The Service-dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialog, Debate, and Directions,'' Armonk, New York, ME Sharpe, 2006, pp 139\u2013149; Tokman, M., and Beitelspacher, L.

M., ''Co-creating Logistics Value: A Service-Dominant Logic Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Logistics Management,'' Vol. 21, no. 3, 2010, pp 375-403.</ref> This emphasis on value-creation is contributing to a change in terminology surrounding distribution processes; \"distribution networks\" are often termed ''value-chains'' while \"distribution centres\" are often termed ''customer fulfillment centres.'' For example, the retail giant Amazon, which utilises both direct online distribution alongside bricks and mortar stores, now calls its despatch centres \"customer fulfillment centres\".<ref>Murphy, J., \"Amazon is Coming to Australia, and if these Projections are Correct, it\u2019s Arrival is Going to be Massive,\" ''News.com,'' 29 April 2017; Pearce, L., \u201cAmazon: Everything You Need to Know about its Plans for Australia,\u201d ''Huffington Post,'' 22 August 2017</ref> Although the term, \"customer fulfillment centre\" has been criticised on the grounds that it is a [[neologism]], its use is becoming increasingly mainstream as it slowly makes its way into introductory marketing textbooks.<ref>See for example, \"Placement: Customer Value Fulfilment,\" Chapter 10 in Gary Armstrong, Stewart Adam, Sara Denize, and Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014</ref>\n\n===Disintermediation===\n\nDisintermediation occurs when manufacturers or service providers eliminate intermediaries from the distribution network and deal directly with purchasers. Disintermediation is found in industries where radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional distributors. The widespread public acceptance of online shopping has been a major trigger for disintermediation in some industries. Certain types of traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside.<ref>Armstrong, G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 315-316</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Lists of distribution companies]]\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[All commodity volume]]\n* [[Cargo]]\n* [[Distribution (economics)]]\n* [[Distribution resource planning]]\n* [[Document automation]] in supply chain management and logistics\n* [[Extended enterprise]]\n* [[Good distribution practice]] (GDP)\n* [[Liquid logistics]]\n* [[Logistics]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Retail]]\n* [[Value chain]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value proposition]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Marketing}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163821/http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/rskidmore/Ghost/library/Chapters/CHPT15-04.pdf pierce college.edu PDF, Product Distribution]\n*[http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/term/82250.html entrepreneur.com Distribution Models]\n*[http://www.allianceexperts.com/en/knowledge/difference-between-an-agent-distributor-and-franchisor/ Difference between an agent, distributor and franchise]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Distribution (marketing)| ]]\n[[Category:Business terms]]\n[[Category:Service industries]]\n[[Category:Trade]]\n", "name_user": "103.81.95.233", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(channel mix some brief)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(marketing)"}

Born in the ancient city of [[Pergamon]] (present-day [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]), Galen travelled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several [[Roman Emperor|emperors]].\n\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and [[medicine]] was principally influenced by the then-current theory of [[humorism]] (also known as the theory of the four humors: black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm), as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as [[Hippocrates]]. Galen's views dominated and influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports were based mainly on the [[dissection]] of [[Old World monkey|monkeys]] and pigs. However, while dissecting them he discovered that their facial expressions were too much like humans; thus, he switched to other animals, especially [[pig]]s. The reason for using animals to discover the human body was due to the fact that dissections and vivisections on humans were strictly prohibited at the time. Galen would encourage his students to go look at dead gladiators or bodies that washed up in order to get better acquainted with the human body. Galen\u2019s most famous experiment that he recreated in public was the squealing pig. The squealing pig experiment was when Galen would cut open a pig, and while it was squealing he would cut the nerve, or vocal cords, showing they controlled the making of sound. His anatomical reports remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' by [[Andreas Vesalius]]<ref name=Vesalius1543>{{cite book\n|author=[[Andreas Vesalius]]\n|title=De humani corporis Fabrica, Libri VII\n|publisher=[[Johannes Oporinus]]\n|location=[[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]\n|language=Latin\n|year=1543\n|url=http://vesalius.northwestern.edu/\n|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref><ref>O'Malley, C., ''Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514\u20131564'', Berkeley: University of California Press</ref> where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.<ref>Siraisi, Nancy G., (1991) Girolamo Cardano and the Art of Medical Narrative, Journal of the History of Ideas. pp. 587\u201388.</ref> Galen's theory of the physiology of the [[circulatory system]] remained unchallenged until ca. 1242, when [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published his book ''Sharh tashrih al-qanun li\u2019 Ibn Sina'' (''[[Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon]]''), in which he reported his discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=John|title=Ibn al-Nafis, the pulmonary circulation, and the Islamic Golden Age|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=1985|volume=105|issue=6|pages=1877\u20131880|pmc=2612469|pmid=18845773|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.91171.2008}}</ref>\n\nGalen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise titled ''That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher''.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Claudii Galeni Pergameni\n|title=\"That the best physician is also a philosopher\" with a Modern Greek Translation\n|editor=Odysseas Hatzopoulos\n|publisher=Odysseas Hatzopoulos & Company: Kaktos Editions\n|location=[[Athens]], [[Greece]]\n|year=1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Theodore J.

His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less skilled and more conservative physicians in the city.

He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, \"this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"\nThe mortality rate of the plague was 7\u201310 percent; the outbreak in 165\u2013168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. [[Otto Seeck]] believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.<ref name=Littman/> Although Galen's description is incomplete, it is sufficient to enable a firm identification of the disease as [[smallpox]].\n\nGalen notes that the [[exanthema]] covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one [[Thucydides]] described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, [[catarrh]], cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.<ref name=Littman/>\n\n===Eudemus===\nWhen the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher Eudemus became ill with [[Plasmodium malariae|quartan fever]], Galen felt obliged to treat him \"since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1641</ref> Galen wrote: \"I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 207.</ref> Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the [[prognosis]] in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]], which relied upon [[divination]] and [[mysticism]]. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: \"In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1663</ref> However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. \"Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 212.</ref>\n\nGarcia-Ballester says the following of Galen\u2019s use of prognosis: \"In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) For Galen, to understand a clinical case technically, \u2018to diagnose\u2019, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, \u2018to prognosticate\u2019. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned with distinguishing prognosis from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1640</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe 11th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources<ref>Amari, M. Biblioteca Arabo-sicula, 2nd vol., Loscher, Turin, Rome, p. 503-504.</ref> that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 217. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in [[Palermo]] was still well preserved in the tenth century. Nutton<ref>Nutton V. Ancient Medicine. Routledge, 2004 226\u20137</ref> believes that ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the ''Suda'' has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan.

Under [[Hippocrates]]' bodily [[humors]] theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four [[Body fluid|bodily fluids]]: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of [[Four temperaments|human temperaments]]. In Galen's view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood\u2014sanguine, black bile\u2014melancholic, yellow bile\u2014choleric, and phlegm\u2014phlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.<ref name=MarkGrant>Mark Grant, 2000, Galen on Food and Diet, Routledge]</ref>\n\n[[File:Claudius Galenus (1906) - Veloso Salgado.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Galen dissecting a monkey, as imagined by [[Veloso Salgado]] in 1906]]\n\nGalen's principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC.<ref>'Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived', Arthur Aufderheide, 'The Scientific Study of Mummies' (2003), page 5</ref> Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living ([[vivisection]]) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and [[primate]]s.<ref name=\"brock\"/> This work was useful because Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans.

In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.\n\nAmong Galen's major contributions to medicine was his work on the [[circulatory system]]. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between [[venous blood|venous]] (dark) and [[artery|arterial]] (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, [[nervous system]], [[respiratory system]], and other structures, his work contained scientific errors.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the [[rete mirabile]] in the carotid sinus.<ref name=MarkGrant/> Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later (beginning with works of [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published ca. 1242) shown to be incorrect.<ref name=Furley1984>Furley, D, and J.

Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> To correct [[cataract]]s in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1034789 | pages=85\u201387 | volume=7 | issue=1 | journal=Med Hist | title=Galen: On Anatomical Procedures: the Later Books | doi=10.1017/s002572730002799x| year=1963 | last1=Keele | first1=K.

This was sharply criticised by the [[Erasistratus|Erasistrateans]], who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject<ref>Brain P (trans.) Galen on Bloodletting: A study of the origins, development, and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works. Cambridge 1986</ref> and in his demonstrations and public disputations.\n\n==Contributions to philosophy==\n{{See also|Philosophy of medicine}}\n\nAlthough the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]]. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work ''That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher'' he took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.\n\nSeveral schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or \"active learning\" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the five major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, Pyrrhonists), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.\n\n=== Opposition to the Stoics ===\nGalen was well known for his advancements in medicine and the circulatory system, but he was also concerned with philosophy. He developed his own tripartite soul model following the examples of Plato; some scholars refer to him as a Platonist.<ref name=gill2007>{{cite journal | author=Gill C | year=2007 | title=Galen and the Stoics: Mortal Enemies or Blood Brothers?. | url=| journal=Phronesis | volume=52 | issue=1| pages=88\u2013120 | doi=10.1163/156852807X177977 }}</ref> Galen developed a theory of personality based on his understanding of fluid circulation in humans, and he believed that there was a physiological basis for mental disorders.<ref name =king2009>King, D.

Through his use of medicine, he was convinced that he came up with a better answer, the brain.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> The Stoics only recognized the soul as having one part, which was the rational soul and they claimed it would be found in the heart. Galen, following Plato's idea, came up with two more parts to the soul.<ref name=\"gill2007\" />\n\nGalen also rejected Stoic propositional logic and instead embraced a hypothetical syllogistic which was strongly influenced by the Peripatetics and based on elements of Aristotelian logic.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien]],'Peripatetic Hypothetical Syllogistic in Galen', ''Rhizai'' 2, 2004 pp.57\u2013102</ref>\n\n===Localization of function===\nOne of Galen's major works, ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle's, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine.<ref name= lloyd2007>Lloyd, G. (2007).

These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul; it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of \"incontinence\" and \"licentiousness\", the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\nIn order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma,<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" />\n\n== Mind\u2013body problem ==\n{{further|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n\nGalen believed there to be no distinction between the mental and the physical.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> He believed that this could be scientifically proven.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\n== Psychotherapy ==\nAnother one of Galen's major works, ''On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul's Passion,'' discussed how to approach and treat psychological problems.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> This was Galen's early attempt at what would later be called [[psychotherapy]]. His book contained directions on how to provide counsel to those with psychological issues to prompt them to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.\n\n==Published works==\n{{Main|Galenic corpus}}\n[[Image:Galeni De curandi ratione V00212 00000008.tif|thumb|''De curandi ratione'']]\n[[File:Galenou Apanta.tif|thumb|''Galenou apanta'' (1538)]]\nGalen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"kotrc\">Kotrc RF, Walters KR.

However, in general, Galen and the [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greek medical tradition]] continued to be studied and followed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after AD 750) [[Arab Muslims]] began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation,<ref name=\"iep\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/galen.htm|title=Galen - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}</ref> while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic.

Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus the Shoemaker]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]. The 7th-century poet [[George Pisida|George of Pisida]] went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen.<ref>George of Pisida. Hexameron 1.1588f</ref> Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively.<ref name=\"brock\">Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh 1916</ref> A few centuries after Galen, [[Palladius (physician)|Palladius Iatrosophista]] stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.\n\nThus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in [[Magnus of Nisibis]]' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death.<ref name=\"brock\"/> Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as [[Oribasius]], physician to the emperor [[Julian the apostate|Julian]] who compiled a ''Synopsis'' in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the \"medical refrigerators of antiquity\".<ref name=\"brock\"/><ref name=\"nutton84\"/> In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were [[John of Alexandria]] and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's ''De Sectis''.<ref>Temkin O. Studies on late Alexandrian medicine. Bull Hist Med 3: 405\u201330, 1935</ref> So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After AD 750, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.<ref name=\"brock\"/>\n\n===Influence on medicine in the Islamic world===\n{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}\n\nGalen's approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Arab Christian [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. He translated (c. 830\u2013870) 129 works of \"Jalinos\"<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7100.html Dear P. Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500\u20131700.

Arabic sources, such as [[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya al-R\u0101zi]] (AD 865\u2013925), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings.<ref name=\"nuttonchoice\"/> One of Hunayn's Arabic translations, ''Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amrad'', which is extant in the Library of [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine & Sciences]], is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen's literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen's work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.\n\nAs the title of ''Doubts on Galen'' by al-R\u0101zi implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as [[Ibn Zuhr]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reflections Chairman's | year = 2004 | title = Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs, Part II: Blood-letting | url = | journal = Heart Views | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 74\u201385 [80] }}</ref> the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further [[Scientific method|inquiry]]. A strong emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and [[empiricism]] led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as al-R\u0101zi, [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.<ref name=\"Dabbagh\">{{cite journal | author = Al-Dabbagh S.

From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the \"Medical Pope of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"brock\"/> [[Constantine the African]] was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as [[Burgundio of Pisa]]'s translation of ''De complexionibus''. Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} However, Galen's influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is [[Mondino de Liuzzi]], who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Raymond F.|title=Stories of Great Physicians|publisher=Whitman|year=1963|pages=46\u201347|chapter=The Anatomist}}</ref>\n\nThe most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was Niccol\u00f2 di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccol\u00f2 worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]]. Among Niccol\u00f2's translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Roberto|title=The Dawn of Humanism in Italy|year=1947|publisher=H.

Venice, 1565]]\n\nThe Renaissance, and the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine Empire]] (1453), were accompanied by an influx of Greek scholars and manuscripts to the West, allowing direct comparison between the Arabic commentaries and the original Greek texts of Galen. This [[New Learning]] and the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]], promoted ''[[literae humaniores]]'' including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, ''De Naturalibus Facultatibus'' appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek.<ref name=\"brock\"/> The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by [[Paracelsus]]' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in [[University of Basel|Basle]].<ref name=\"brock\"/> Nevertheless, Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the [[Great Lavra]] of [[Mt Athos]]. It depicts pagan sages at the foot of the [[Tree of Jesse]], with Galen between the [[Sibyl]] and [[Aristotle]].<ref name=\"nutton84\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dahsm.medschool.ucsf.edu/history/IntroCourseIPDF/Nutton_Galen_to_Alex.pdf|title=Nutton V.

Vesalius' most famous work, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as [[Jacques Dubois|Jacobus Sylvius]]. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosans C | year = 1997 | title = Galen's Critique of Rationalist and Empiricist Anatomy | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1004266427468 | pmid = 11618979 }}</ref> The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Mondino de Liuzzi]]. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the [[interventricular septum]] of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (''Nat Fac III xv''). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful \"''Christianismi restitutio''\" (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\n\n[[Michael Servetus]], using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\" during his stay in France, was [[Vesalius]]' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],<ref>2011 \"The love for truth.

Born in the ancient city of [[Pergamon]] (present-day [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]), Galen travelled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several [[Roman Emperor|emperors]].\n\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and [[medicine]] was principally influenced by the then-current theory of [[humorism]] (also known as the theory of the four humors: black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm), as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as [[Hippocrates]]. Galen's views dominated and influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports were based mainly on the [[dissection]] of [[Old World monkey|monkeys]] and pigs. However, while dissecting them he discovered that their facial expressions were too much like humans; thus, he switched to other animals, especially [[pig]]s. The reason for using animals to discover the human body was due to the fact that dissections and vivisections on humans were strictly prohibited at the time. Galen would encourage his students to go look at dead gladiators or bodies that washed up in order to get better acquainted with the human body. Galen\u2019s most famous experiment that he recreated in public was the squealing pig. The squealing pig experiment was when Galen would cut open a pig, and while it was squealing he would cut the nerve, or vocal cords, showing they controlled the making of sound. His anatomical reports remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' by [[Andreas Vesalius]]<ref name=Vesalius1543>{{cite book\n|author=[[Andreas Vesalius]]\n|title=De humani corporis Fabrica, Libri VII\n|publisher=[[Johannes Oporinus]]\n|location=[[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]\n|language=Latin\n|year=1543\n|url=http://vesalius.northwestern.edu/\n|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref><ref>O'Malley, C., ''Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514\u20131564'', Berkeley: University of California Press</ref> where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.<ref>Siraisi, Nancy G., (1991) Girolamo Cardano and the Art of Medical Narrative, Journal of the History of Ideas. pp. 587\u201388.</ref> Galen's theory of the physiology of the [[circulatory system]] remained unchallenged until ca. 1242, when [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published his book ''Sharh tashrih al-qanun li\u2019 Ibn Sina'' (''[[Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon]]''), in which he reported his discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=John|title=Ibn al-Nafis, the pulmonary circulation, and the Islamic Golden Age|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=1985|volume=105|issue=6|pages=1877\u20131880|pmc=2612469|pmid=18845773|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.91171.2008}}</ref>\n\nGalen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise titled ''That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher''.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Claudii Galeni Pergameni\n|title=\"That the best physician is also a philosopher\" with a Modern Greek Translation\n|editor=Odysseas Hatzopoulos\n|publisher=Odysseas Hatzopoulos & Company: Kaktos Editions\n|location=[[Athens]], [[Greece]]\n|year=1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Theodore J.

His studies also took in each of the principal philosophical systems of the time, including [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Epicurean]]. His father had planned a traditional career for Galen in philosophy or politics and took care to expose him to literary and philosophical influences. However, Galen states that in around AD 145 his father had a dream in which the god [[Asclepius]] (Aesculapius) appeared and commanded Nicon to send his son to study medicine. Again, no expense was spared, and following his earlier liberal education, at 16 he began studies at the prestigious local sanctuary or [[Asclepeion|Asclepieum]] dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine, as a \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (''therapeutes'', or attendant) for four years. There he came under the influence of men like [[Aeschrion of Pergamon]], Stratonicus and Satyrus. Asclepiea functioned as spas or sanitoria to which the sick would come to seek the ministrations of the priesthood. Romans frequented the temple at Pergamon in search of medical relief from illness and disease. It was also the haunt of notable people such as Claudius Charax the historian, [[Aelius Aristides]] the orator, [[Polemon of Laodicea|Polemo]] the sophist, and Cuspius Rufinus the Consul.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/>\n\nGalen's father died in 148, leaving Galen independently wealthy at the age of 19. He then followed the advice he found in Hippocrates' teaching<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daedalus.umkc.edu/hippocrates/HippocratesLoeb1/page.66.php?size=240x320|title=Hippocrates Collected Works I|website=daedalus.umkc.edu}}</ref> and travelled and studied widely including such destinations as [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], [[Crete]], [[Cilicia]] (now [[\u00c7ukurova]]), [[Cyprus]], and finally the great medical school of [[Medicine in ancient Greece|Alexandria]], exposing himself to the various schools of thought in medicine. In 157, aged 28, he returned to Pergamon as physician to the gladiators of the High Priest of Asia, one of the most influential and wealthy men in Asia. Galen claims that the High Priest chose him over other physicians after he eviscerated an ape and challenged other physicians to repair the damage. When they refused, Galen performed the [[surgery]] himself and in so doing won the favor of the High Priest of Asia. Over his four years there, he learned the importance of diet, fitness, hygiene and preventive measures, as well as living anatomy, and the treatment of fractures and severe trauma, referring to their [[wounds]] as \"windows into the body\". Only five deaths among the gladiators occurred while he held the post, compared to sixty in his predecessor's time, a result that is in general ascribed to the attention he paid to their wounds. At the same time he pursued studies in theoretical medicine and philosophy.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/><ref name=\"ustun\">Ustun C. Galen and his anatomic eponym: Vein of Galen.

His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less skilled and more conservative physicians in the city.  When Galen's animosity with the Roman medical practitioners became serious, he feared he might be exiled or poisoned, so he left the city.<ref name=Eichholz>D.E.

He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. The following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that [[Asclepius]] was against the project.<ref name=Littman>R.J. Littman and M.L. Littman, 1973 Galen and the Antonine Plague, The American Journal of Philology 94 no. 3, p. 243\u2013255</ref> He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir [[Commodus]]. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.\n\nGalen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperor\u2019s life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3\u20134, in about 189, under Commodus\u2019 reign, a pestilence occurred which at its height killed 2,000 people a day in Rome. This was most likely the same plague that struck Rome during Marcus Aurelius\u2019 reign.<ref name=Littman/>\n\nGalen became physician to [[Septimius Severus]] during his reign in Rome. Galen compliments Severus and [[Caracalla]] on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentions three cases in which they had been of use in 198.<ref name=Eichholz/>\n\n===The Antonine Plague===\n{{Main|Antonine Plague}}\n[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The 'Galen' group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]]; he is depicted top center.]]\nThe Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aurelius\u2019 family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and held an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. He had first-hand knowledge of the disease, and was present in Rome when it first struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168\u201369 during an outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]]. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, \"this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"\nThe mortality rate of the plague was 7\u201310 percent; the outbreak in 165\u2013168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. [[Otto Seeck]] believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.<ref name=Littman/> Although Galen's description is incomplete, it is sufficient to enable a firm identification of the disease as [[smallpox]].\n\nGalen notes that the [[exanthema]] covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one [[Thucydides]] described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, [[catarrh]], cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.<ref name=Littman/>\n\n===Eudemus===\nWhen the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher Eudemus became ill with [[Plasmodium malariae|quartan fever]], Galen felt obliged to treat him \"since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1641</ref> Galen wrote: \"I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 207.</ref> Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the [[prognosis]] in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]], which relied upon [[divination]] and [[mysticism]]. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: \"In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1663</ref> However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. \"Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning.

Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 212.</ref>\n\nGarcia-Ballester says the following of Galen\u2019s use of prognosis: \"In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) For Galen, to understand a clinical case technically, \u2018to diagnose\u2019, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, \u2018to prognosticate\u2019. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned with distinguishing prognosis from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1640</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe 11th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources<ref>Amari, M. Biblioteca Arabo-sicula, 2nd vol., Loscher, Turin, Rome, p. 503-504.</ref> that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 217. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in [[Palermo]] was still well preserved in the tenth century. Nutton<ref>Nutton V. Ancient Medicine. Routledge, 2004 226\u20137</ref> believes that ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the ''Suda'' has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan.

Under [[Hippocrates]]' bodily [[humors]] theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four [[Body fluid|bodily fluids]]: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of [[Four temperaments|human temperaments]]. In Galen's view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood\u2014sanguine, black bile\u2014melancholic, yellow bile\u2014choleric, and phlegm\u2014phlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.<ref name=MarkGrant>Mark Grant, 2000, Galen on Food and Diet, Routledge]</ref>\n\n[[File:Claudius Galenus (1906) - Veloso Salgado.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Galen dissecting a monkey, as imagined by [[Veloso Salgado]] in 1906]]\n\nGalen's principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC.<ref>'Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived', Arthur Aufderheide, 'The Scientific Study of Mummies' (2003), page 5</ref> Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living ([[vivisection]]) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and [[primate]]s.<ref name=\"brock\"/> This work was useful because Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans.

In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.\n\nAmong Galen's major contributions to medicine was his work on the [[circulatory system]]. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between [[venous blood|venous]] (dark) and [[artery|arterial]] (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, [[nervous system]], [[respiratory system]], and other structures, his work contained scientific errors.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the [[rete mirabile]] in the carotid sinus.<ref name=MarkGrant/> Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later (beginning with works of [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published ca. 1242) shown to be incorrect.<ref name=Furley1984>Furley, D, and J.

Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> To correct [[cataract]]s in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1034789 | pages=85\u201387 | volume=7 | issue=1 | journal=Med Hist | title=Galen: On Anatomical Procedures: the Later Books | doi=10.1017/s002572730002799x| year=1963 | last1=Keele | first1=K.

This was sharply criticised by the [[Erasistratus|Erasistrateans]], who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject<ref>Brain P (trans.) Galen on Bloodletting: A study of the origins, development, and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works. Cambridge 1986</ref> and in his demonstrations and public disputations.\n\n==Contributions to philosophy==\n{{See also|Philosophy of medicine}}\n\nAlthough the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]]. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work ''That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher'' he took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.\n\nSeveral schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or \"active learning\" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the five major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, Pyrrhonists), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.\n\n=== Opposition to the Stoics ===\nGalen was well known for his advancements in medicine and the circulatory system, but he was also concerned with philosophy. He developed his own tripartite soul model following the examples of Plato; some scholars refer to him as a Platonist.<ref name=gill2007>{{cite journal | author=Gill C | year=2007 | title=Galen and the Stoics: Mortal Enemies or Blood Brothers?. | url=| journal=Phronesis | volume=52 | issue=1| pages=88\u2013120 | doi=10.1163/156852807X177977 }}</ref> Galen developed a theory of personality based on his understanding of fluid circulation in humans, and he believed that there was a physiological basis for mental disorders.<ref name =king2009>King, D.

Through his use of medicine, he was convinced that he came up with a better answer, the brain.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> The Stoics only recognized the soul as having one part, which was the rational soul and they claimed it would be found in the heart. Galen, following Plato's idea, came up with two more parts to the soul.<ref name=\"gill2007\" />\n\nGalen also rejected Stoic propositional logic and instead embraced a hypothetical syllogistic which was strongly influenced by the Peripatetics and based on elements of Aristotelian logic.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien]],'Peripatetic Hypothetical Syllogistic in Galen', ''Rhizai'' 2, 2004 pp.57\u2013102</ref>\n\n===Localization of function===\nOne of Galen's major works, ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views.

Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine.<ref name= lloyd2007>Lloyd, G. (2007).

These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul; it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of \"incontinence\" and \"licentiousness\", the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\nIn order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma,<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" />\n\n== Mind\u2013body problem ==\n{{further|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n\nGalen believed there to be no distinction between the mental and the physical.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> He believed that this could be scientifically proven.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\n== Psychotherapy ==\nAnother one of Galen's major works, ''On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul's Passion,'' discussed how to approach and treat psychological problems.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> This was Galen's early attempt at what would later be called [[psychotherapy]]. His book contained directions on how to provide counsel to those with psychological issues to prompt them to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.\n\n==Published works==\n{{Main|Galenic corpus}}\n[[Image:Galeni De curandi ratione V00212 00000008.tif|thumb|''De curandi ratione'']]\n[[File:Galenou Apanta.tif|thumb|''Galenou apanta'' (1538)]]\nGalen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"kotrc\">Kotrc RF, Walters KR.

However, in general, Galen and the [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greek medical tradition]] continued to be studied and followed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after AD 750) [[Arab Muslims]] began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation,<ref name=\"iep\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/galen.htm|title=Galen - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}</ref> while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic.

Galen in the eyes of his contemporaries. BHM 58(3) fall 1984 315\u201324</ref> the Emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as \"Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum\" (first among doctors and unique among philosophers ''Praen 14: 660''). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus the Shoemaker]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]. The 7th-century poet [[George Pisida|George of Pisida]] went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen.<ref>George of Pisida. Hexameron 1.1588f</ref> Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively.<ref name=\"brock\">Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh 1916</ref> A few centuries after Galen, [[Palladius (physician)|Palladius Iatrosophista]] stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.\n\nThus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in [[Magnus of Nisibis]]' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death.<ref name=\"brock\"/> Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as [[Oribasius]], physician to the emperor [[Julian the apostate|Julian]] who compiled a ''Synopsis'' in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the \"medical refrigerators of antiquity\".<ref name=\"brock\"/><ref name=\"nutton84\"/> In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were [[John of Alexandria]] and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's ''De Sectis''.<ref>Temkin O. Studies on late Alexandrian medicine. Bull Hist Med 3: 405\u201330, 1935</ref> So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After AD 750, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.<ref name=\"brock\"/>\n\n===Influence on medicine in the Islamic world===\n{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}\n\nGalen's approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Arab Christian [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. He translated (c. 830\u2013870) 129 works of \"Jalinos\"<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7100.html Dear P. Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500\u20131700.

A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen's work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin.

A strong emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and [[empiricism]] led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as al-R\u0101zi, [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis.

From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the \"Medical Pope of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"brock\"/> [[Constantine the African]] was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as [[Burgundio of Pisa]]'s translation of ''De complexionibus''. Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} However, Galen's influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is [[Mondino de Liuzzi]], who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Raymond F.|title=Stories of Great Physicians|publisher=Whitman|year=1963|pages=46\u201347|chapter=The Anatomist}}</ref>\n\nThe most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was Niccol\u00f2 di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccol\u00f2 worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]]. Among Niccol\u00f2's translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Roberto|title=The Dawn of Humanism in Italy|year=1947|publisher=H.

Venice, 1565]]\n\nThe Renaissance, and the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine Empire]] (1453), were accompanied by an influx of Greek scholars and manuscripts to the West, allowing direct comparison between the Arabic commentaries and the original Greek texts of Galen. This [[New Learning]] and the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]], promoted ''[[literae humaniores]]'' including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, ''De Naturalibus Facultatibus'' appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek.<ref name=\"brock\"/> The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by [[Paracelsus]]' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in [[University of Basel|Basle]].<ref name=\"brock\"/> Nevertheless, Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the [[Great Lavra]] of [[Mt Athos]]. It depicts pagan sages at the foot of the [[Tree of Jesse]], with Galen between the [[Sibyl]] and [[Aristotle]].<ref name=\"nutton84\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dahsm.medschool.ucsf.edu/history/IntroCourseIPDF/Nutton_Galen_to_Alex.pdf|title=Nutton V.

Vesalius' most famous work, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as [[Jacques Dubois|Jacobus Sylvius]]. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosans C | year = 1997 | title = Galen's Critique of Rationalist and Empiricist Anatomy | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1004266427468 | pmid = 11618979 }}</ref> The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Mondino de Liuzzi]]. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the [[interventricular septum]] of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (''Nat Fac III xv''). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful \"''Christianismi restitutio''\" (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\n\n[[Michael Servetus]], using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\" during his stay in France, was [[Vesalius]]' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],<ref>2011 \"The love for truth.

It has also been used to study the metabolism of other organs such as [[muscles]]. In the case of muscles, NMR is used to measure the [[intramyocellular lipids]] content (IMCL).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Preul MC, Caramanos Z, Collins DL, Villemure JG, Leblanc R, Olivier A, Pokrupa R, Arnold DL | title = Accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of human brain tumors by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 323\u20135 | date = March 1996 | pmid = 8612232 | doi = 10.1038/nm0396-323 }}</ref>\n\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy is an analytical technique that can be used to complement the more common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the characterization of tissue. Both techniques typically acquire signal from hydrogen protons (other endogenous nuclei such as those of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus are also used), but MRI acquires signal primarily from protons which reside within water and fat, which are approximately a thousand times more abundant than the molecules detected with MRS. As a result, MRI often uses the larger available signal to produce very clean 2D images, whereas MRS very frequently only acquires signal from a single localized region, referred to as a \"voxel\". MRS can be used to determine the relative concentrations and physical properties of a variety of biochemicals frequently referred to as \"metabolites\" due to their role in [[metabolism]].\n\n==Data Acquisition==\nAcquiring an MRS scan is very similar to that of MRI with a few additional steps preceding data acquisition. These steps include:\n\n#Shimming the magnetic field: this step is taken to correct for the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field by tuning different pulses in the x, y, and z directions. This step is usually automated but can be performed manually. \n#Suppressing the water signal: because water molecules contain hydrogen, and the relative concentration of water to metabolite is about 10,000:1, the water signal is often suppressed or the metabolite peaks will not be discernible in the spectra. This is achieved by adding water suppression pulses. Recent advances allow proton MRS without water suppression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dong Z | title = Proton MRS and MRSI of the brain without water suppression | journal = Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy | volume = 86-87 | pages = 65\u201379 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25919199 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnmrs.2014.12.001 }}</ref> \n#Choosing a spectroscopic technique: careful planning of measurements is important in the context of a specific experiment. \n##Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS): has a minimum spatial resolution of approximately 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, and has the cleanest spectrum free from unwanted artifacts due to the small acquired volume leading to easy shim and less unwanted signals from outside the voxel. \n##Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI): a 2-dimensional (or 3-dimensional) MRS technique which uses two/three phase-encoding directions to create a two/three-dimensional map of spectra. The drawbacks of this technique is that having two/three phase encoding directions requires lengthy scan time, and the larger volume of acquisition is more likely to introduce artefacts due to poorer shimming, unsuppressed water, as well as the inherent [[sinc]] point-spread-function due to the finite sampling of k-space which results in the signal from one voxel bleeding into all others.\n\n== Data Quantification ==\nDuring data acquisition, the scan acquires raw data in the form of spectra. This raw data must be quantified to achieve a meaningful understanding of the spectrum. This quantification is achieved via linear combination<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref>. Linear combination is a technique that uses basis sets. Basis sets are transformed spectral shapes (i.e. shifted, broadened, phased) and acquired via numerical simulation or experimentally measured in phantoms. With the basis sets, the raw data can now be quantified as measured concentrations of different chemical species. Software is used to complete this. LCModel, a commercial software, has been for most of the field's history the standard software quantification package. However, now there are many freeware packages for quantification: AMARES, AQSES, Gannet, INSPECTOR, jMRUI, TARQUIN, and more<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nBefore linear combination, peak extraction used to be used for data quantification. However, this is no longer popular nor recommended<ref name=\":0\" />. Peak extraction is a technique which integrates the area underneath a signal. Despite its seemingly straightforwardness, there are several confounds with this technique. Chiefly, the individual Lorentzian shapes employed do not scale up to match the complexity of the spectral shapes of J-coupled metabolites and is too simple to discern between overlapping peaks<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==Pulse Sequences==\nSimilar to MRI, MRS uses pulse sequences to acquire signal from several different molecules to generate a spectra instead of an image. In MRS, STEAM (Stimulated Echo Acquisition Method) and PRESS (Point Resolved Spectroscopy) are the two primary pulse sequence techniques used. In terms of advantages, STEAM is best for imaging metabolites with shorter T2 and has lower SAR, while PRESS has higher SNR than STEAM. Besides STEAM and PRESS as the principal sequences used in ''in vivo'' magnetic resonance spectroscopy, there are adiabatic pulses. Adiabatic pulses produce uniform flip angles when there is extreme B<sub>1</sub> inhomogeneity. Thus, these sequences allow us to achieve excitation that achieves the sought-for B<sub>1</sub> insensitivity and off-resonance in the RF coil and sampled object. Specifically, adiabatic pulses solve the problem of signal dropout that comes from the different B<sub>1</sub> flux patterns that result from the surface transmit coils used and the usage of normal pulses.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=de Graaf RA, Luo Y, Terpstra M, Garwood M|date=November 1995|title=Spectral editing with adiabatic pulses|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Series B|volume=109|issue=2|pages=184\u201393|doi=10.1006/jmrb.1995.0008|pmid=7582600}}</ref> Adiabatic pulses are also useful for constraints on RF peak power for excitation and lowering tissue heating.\n----\n=== Spatial Localization Sequences ===\nIn PRESS, the two chief drawbacks are lengthy echo time (TE) and chemical shift displacement (CSD) artifacts.<ref name=\"van_der_Graaf_2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=van der Graaf M|date=March 2010|title=In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy: basic methodology and clinical applications|journal=European Biophysics Journal|volume=39|issue=4|pages=527\u201340|doi=10.1007/s00249-009-0517-y|pmc=2841275|pmid=19680645}}</ref> Lengthy echo time arises from the fact that PRESS uses two 180\u00b0 pulses, unlike STEAM which uses exclusively 90\u00b0 pulses. The duration of 180\u00b0 pulses are generally longer than 90\u00b0 pulses because it takes more energy to flip a net magnetization vector completely as opposed to only 90\u00b0. Chemical shift displacement artifacts arises partly because of less optimal slice selection profiles. Multiple 180\u00b0 pulses does not allow a very short TE, resulting in less optimal slice selection profile. Additionally, multiple 180\u00b0 pulses means smaller bandwidth and thus larger chemical shift displacement. Specifically, the chemical shift displacement artifacts occur because signals with different chemical shifts experience different frequency-encoded slice selections and thus do not originate from same volume. Additionally, this effect becomes greater at higher magnetic field strengths.\n\nSPECIAL consists of a spatially selective pre-excitation inversion pulse (typically AFP) followed by spatially selective excitation and refocusing pulses, both of which are usually SLR or truncated sinc pulses.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref> \n\nSPECIAL is a hybrid of PRESS and Image-Selected In Vivo Spectroscopy (ISIS). ISIS achieves spatial localization in the three spatial dimensions through a series of eight slice-selective preinversion pulses that can be appropriately positioned so that the sum of the eight cycles removes all signal outside the desired 3D region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref> SPECIAL obtains spatial localization from only a single dimension with pre-excitation inversion pulses (cycled on and off every other repetition time [TR]), making it a two-cycle sequence.\n\nThe use of the preinversion pulse to remove one refocusing pulse (as compared with PRESS) is what allows SPECIAL to achieve a short TE, reaching a minimum of 2.2 msec on a preclinical scanner in rat brain while being able to recover the full signal and as low as 6 msec on a clinical 3T scanner.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref>\n\nThe largest drawback of SPECIAL and SPECIAL-sLASER is that they are two-cycle schemes, and systematic variations between cycles will manifest in their difference spectrum. Lipid contamination is a particularly large problem with SPECIAL and has been addressed in three separate ways.\n\nThe first is through OVS, which will reduce the contamination of lipid signals that originate from outside the voxel, although this comes at the cost of an increase in SAR. The second is not to set the amplitude of the pre-excitation inversion pulse to zero every other TR, but instead to shift the location of this ISIS plane such that the excited volume for the off condition is outside the object. This has been shown to greatly reduce lipid contamination, speculated to have arisen from the interaction between the RF pulse and lipid compartments due to incomplete relaxation, magnetization transfer, or the homonuclear Overhauser effect, although the exact mechanism remains unknown.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref> The third is to use an echo-planar readout that dephases magnetization from outside the voxel, also shown to substantially reduce lipid artifacts.

This chemical shift is dictated by neighboring protons within the molecule. Therefore, metabolites can be characterized by their unique set of 1H chemical shifts. The metabolites that MRS probes for have known (1H) chemical shifts that have previously been identified in NMR spectra. These metabolites include:\n\n# [[N-Acetylaspartic acid|N-acetyl Aspartate]] (NAA): with its major resonance peak at 2.02 ppm, decrease in levels of NAA indicate loss or damage to neuronal tissue, which results from many types of insults to the brain. Its presence in normal conditions indicates neuronal and axonal integrity.\n# [[Choline]]: with its major peak at 3.2 ppm, choline is known to be associated with membrane turnover, or increase in cell division. Increased choline indicates increase in cell production or membrane breakdown, which can suggest demyelination or presence of malignant tumors.\n# [[Creatine]] and [[phosphocreatine]]: with its major peak at 3.0 ppm, creatine marks metabolism of brain energy. Gradual loss of creatine in conjunction with other major metabolites indicates tissue death or major cell death resulting from disease, injury or lack of blood supply. Increase in creatine concentration could be a response to cranialcerebral trauma. Absence of creatine may be indicative of a rare congenital disease.\n# [[Lipids]]: with their major aliphatic peaks located in the 0.9\u20131.5 ppm range, increase in lipids is seen is also indicative of [[necrosis]]. These spectra are easily contaminated, as lipids are not only present in the brain, but also in other biological tissue such as the fat in the scalp and area between the scalp and skull.\n# [[Lactic acid|Lactate]]: Is an AX3 system which results in a doublet (two symmetric peaks) centered about 1.31 ppm, and a quartet (four peaks with relative peak heights of 1:2:2:1) centered about 4.10 ppm. The doublet at 1.31 ppm is typically quantified as the quartet may be suppressed through water saturation or obscured by residual water. In healthy subjects lactate is not visible, for its concentration is lower that the detection limit of MRS; however, presence of this peak indicates [[glycolysis]] has been initiated in an oxygen-deficient environment. Several causes of this include [[ischemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[mitochondrial disorder]]s, and some types of tumors.\n# [[Myo-inositol]]: with its major peak at 3.56 ppm, an increase in Myo-inositol has been seen to be disrupted in patients with Alzheimer's, dementia, and HIV patients.\n# [[Glutamate]] and [[glutamine]]: these amino acids are marked by a series of resonance peaks between 2.2 and 2.4 ppm. [[Hyperammonemia]], hepatic encephalopathy are two major conditions that result in elevated levels of glutamine and glutamate. MRS, used in conjunction with MRI or some other imaging technique, can be used to detect changes in the concentrations of these metabolites, or significantly abnormal concentrations of these metabolites.\n# [[GABA]] can be detected primarily from its peaks at approximately 3.0 ppm, however because creatine has a strong singlet at 3.0 ppm with approximately 20x the amplitude a technique which exploits [[J-coupling]] must be used to accurately quantify GABA. The most common techniques for this are J-difference editing (MEGA), or J-resolved (as used in JPRESS)\n# [[Glutathione]] can also be detected from its peak at peak at 3.0 ppm, however similar to GABA it also must use a method which exploits [[J-coupling]] to remove the overlaying creatine signal.\n\n==Limitations of MRS==\nThe major limitation to MRS is its low available signal due to the low concentration of metabolites as compared to water. As such, it has inherently poor temporal and spatial resolution. Nevertheless, no alternate technique is able to quantify metabolism in vivo non-invasively and thus MRS remains a valuable tool for research and clinical scientists. \n\n==Non-Proton (<sup>1</sup>H) MRS==\n''<u><sup>31</sup>Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</u>''\n\n<sup>1</sup>H MRS's clinical success is only rivaled by <sup>31</sup>P MRS. This is in large part because of the relatively high sensitivity of phosphorus NMR (7% of protons) combined with a 100% natural abundance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=90-93}}</ref>\nConsequently, high-quality spectra are acquired within minutes. Even at low field strengths, great spectra resolution is obtained because of the relatively large (~30 ppm) chemical shift dispersion for in vivo phosphates. Clinically, phosphorus NMR excels because it detects all metabolites playing key roles in tissue energy metabolism and can indirectly deduce intracellular pH. However, phosphorus NMR is chiefly challenged by the limited number of metabolites it can detect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=90-93}}</ref>\n\n''<u><sup>13</sup>Carbon Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</u>''\n\nIn contrast to phosphorus NMR, carbon NMR is an insensitive technique.

See also [[Hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI]].\n\n<u><sup>''23''</sup>''Sodium Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy''</u>\n\nSodium NMR is infamous for its low sensitivity (9.2% relative to proton sensitivity) and low SNR because of its low sodium concentration (30 - 100 mM), especially compared to protons (40 - 50 M).<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=96-102}}</ref> However, interest in sodium NMR has been reinspired by recent significant gains in SNR at high magnetic fields, along with improved coil designs and optimized pulse sequences.

Both techniques typically acquire signal from hydrogen protons (other endogenous nuclei such as those of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus are also used), but MRI acquires signal primarily from protons which reside within water and fat, which are approximately a thousand times more abundant than the molecules detected with MRS. As a result, MRI often uses the larger available signal to produce very clean 2D images, whereas MRS very frequently only acquires signal from a single localized region, referred to as a \"voxel\". MRS can be used to determine the relative concentrations and physical properties of a variety of biochemicals frequently referred to as \"metabolites\" due to their role in [[metabolism]].\n\n==Data Acquisition==\nAcquiring an MRS scan is very similar to that of MRI with a few additional steps preceding data acquisition. These steps include:\n\n#Shimming the magnetic field: this step is taken to correct for the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field by tuning different pulses in the x, y, and z directions. This step is usually automated but can be performed manually. \n#Suppressing the water signal: because water molecules contain hydrogen, and the relative concentration of water to metabolite is about 10,000:1, the water signal is often suppressed or the metabolite peaks will not be discernible in the spectra. This is achieved by adding water suppression pulses. Recent advances allow proton MRS without water suppression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dong Z | title = Proton MRS and MRSI of the brain without water suppression | journal = Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy | volume = 86-87 | pages = 65\u201379 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25919199 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnmrs.2014.12.001 }}</ref> \n#Choosing a spectroscopic technique: careful planning of measurements is important in the context of a specific experiment. \n##Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS): has a minimum spatial resolution of approximately 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, and has the cleanest spectrum free from unwanted artifacts due to the small acquired volume leading to easy shim and less unwanted signals from outside the voxel. \n##Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI): a 2-dimensional (or 3-dimensional) MRS technique which uses two/three phase-encoding directions to create a two/three-dimensional map of spectra. The drawbacks of this technique is that having two/three phase encoding directions requires lengthy scan time, and the larger volume of acquisition is more likely to introduce artefacts due to poorer shimming, unsuppressed water, as well as the inherent [[sinc]] point-spread-function due to the finite sampling of k-space which results in the signal from one voxel bleeding into all others.\n\n== Data Quantification ==\nDuring data acquisition, the scan acquires raw data in the form of spectra. This raw data must be quantified to achieve a meaningful understanding of the spectrum. This quantification is achieved via linear combination<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref>. Linear combination is a technique that uses basis sets. Basis sets are transformed spectral shapes (i.e. shifted, broadened, phased) and acquired via numerical simulation or experimentally measured in phantoms. With the basis sets, the raw data can now be quantified as measured concentrations of different chemical species. Software is used to complete this. LCModel, a commercial software, has been for most of the field's history the standard software quantification package. However, now there are many freeware packages for quantification: AMARES, AQSES, Gannet, INSPECTOR, jMRUI, TARQUIN, and more<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nBefore linear combination, peak extraction used to be used for data quantification. However, this is no longer popular nor recommended<ref name=\":0\" />. Peak extraction is a technique which integrates the area underneath a signal. Despite its seemingly straightforwardness, there are several confounds with this technique. Chiefly, the individual Lorentzian shapes employed do not scale up to match the complexity of the spectral shapes of J-coupled metabolites and is too simple to discern between overlapping peaks<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==Pulse Sequences==\nSimilar to MRI, MRS uses pulse sequences to acquire signal from several different molecules to generate a spectra instead of an image. In MRS, STEAM (Stimulated Echo Acquisition Method) and PRESS (Point Resolved Spectroscopy) are the two primary pulse sequence techniques used. In terms of advantages, STEAM is best for imaging metabolites with shorter T2 and has lower SAR, while PRESS has higher SNR than STEAM. Besides STEAM and PRESS as the principal sequences used in ''in vivo'' magnetic resonance spectroscopy, there are adiabatic pulses. Adiabatic pulses produce uniform flip angles when there is extreme B<sub>1</sub> inhomogeneity. Thus, these sequences allow us to achieve excitation that achieves the sought-for B<sub>1</sub> insensitivity and off-resonance in the RF coil and sampled object. Specifically, adiabatic pulses solve the problem of signal dropout that comes from the different B<sub>1</sub> flux patterns that result from the surface transmit coils used and the usage of normal pulses.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=de Graaf RA, Luo Y, Terpstra M, Garwood M|date=November 1995|title=Spectral editing with adiabatic pulses|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Series B|volume=109|issue=2|pages=184\u201393|doi=10.1006/jmrb.1995.0008|pmid=7582600}}</ref> Adiabatic pulses are also useful for constraints on RF peak power for excitation and lowering tissue heating.\n----\n=== Spatial Localization Sequences ===\nIn PRESS, the two chief drawbacks are lengthy echo time (TE) and chemical shift displacement (CSD) artifacts.<ref name=\"van_der_Graaf_2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=van der Graaf M|date=March 2010|title=In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy: basic methodology and clinical applications|journal=European Biophysics Journal|volume=39|issue=4|pages=527\u201340|doi=10.1007/s00249-009-0517-y|pmc=2841275|pmid=19680645}}</ref> Lengthy echo time arises from the fact that PRESS uses two 180\u00b0 pulses, unlike STEAM which uses exclusively 90\u00b0 pulses. The duration of 180\u00b0 pulses are generally longer than 90\u00b0 pulses because it takes more energy to flip a net magnetization vector completely as opposed to only 90\u00b0. Chemical shift displacement artifacts arises partly because of less optimal slice selection profiles. Multiple 180\u00b0 pulses does not allow a very short TE, resulting in less optimal slice selection profile. Additionally, multiple 180\u00b0 pulses means smaller bandwidth and thus larger chemical shift displacement. Specifically, the chemical shift displacement artifacts occur because signals with different chemical shifts experience different frequency-encoded slice selections and thus do not originate from same volume. Additionally, this effect becomes greater at higher magnetic field strengths.\n\nSPECIAL consists of a spatially selective pre-excitation inversion pulse (typically AFP) followed by spatially selective excitation and refocusing pulses, both of which are usually SLR or truncated sinc pulses.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref> \n\nSPECIAL is a hybrid of PRESS and Image-Selected In Vivo Spectroscopy (ISIS).

Lipid contamination is a particularly large problem with SPECIAL and has been addressed in three separate ways.\n\nThe first is through OVS, which will reduce the contamination of lipid signals that originate from outside the voxel, although this comes at the cost of an increase in SAR. The second is not to set the amplitude of the pre-excitation inversion pulse to zero every other TR, but instead to shift the location of this ISIS plane such that the excited volume for the off condition is outside the object. This has been shown to greatly reduce lipid contamination, speculated to have arisen from the interaction between the RF pulse and lipid compartments due to incomplete relaxation, magnetization transfer, or the homonuclear Overhauser effect, although the exact mechanism remains unknown.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Landheer|first=Karl|last2=Schulte|first2=Rolf F.|last3=Treacy|first3=Michael S.|last4=Swanberg|first4=Kelley M.|last5=Juchem|first5=Christoph|title=Theoretical description of modern 1H in Vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic pulse sequences|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1002/jmri.26846|pmid=31273880|issn=1522-2586|year=2019}}</ref> The third is to use an echo-planar readout that dephases magnetization from outside the voxel, also shown to substantially reduce lipid artifacts.

This chemical shift is dictated by neighboring protons within the molecule. Therefore, metabolites can be characterized by their unique set of 1H chemical shifts. The metabolites that MRS probes for have known (1H) chemical shifts that have previously been identified in NMR spectra. These metabolites include:\n\n# [[N-Acetylaspartic acid|N-acetyl Aspartate]] (NAA): with its major resonance peak at 2.02 ppm, decrease in levels of NAA indicate loss or damage to neuronal tissue, which results from many types of insults to the brain. Its presence in normal conditions indicates neuronal and axonal integrity.\n# [[Choline]]: with its major peak at 3.2 ppm, choline is known to be associated with membrane turnover, or increase in cell division. Increased choline indicates increase in cell production or membrane breakdown, which can suggest demyelination or presence of malignant tumors.\n# [[Creatine]] and [[phosphocreatine]]: with its major peak at 3.0 ppm, creatine marks metabolism of brain energy. Gradual loss of creatine in conjunction with other major metabolites indicates tissue death or major cell death resulting from disease, injury or lack of blood supply. Increase in creatine concentration could be a response to cranialcerebral trauma. Absence of creatine may be indicative of a rare congenital disease.\n# [[Lipids]]: with their major aliphatic peaks located in the 0.9\u20131.5 ppm range, increase in lipids is seen is also indicative of [[necrosis]]. These spectra are easily contaminated, as lipids are not only present in the brain, but also in other biological tissue such as the fat in the scalp and area between the scalp and skull.\n# [[Lactic acid|Lactate]]: Is an AX3 system which results in a doublet (two symmetric peaks) centered about 1.31 ppm, and a quartet (four peaks with relative peak heights of 1:2:2:1) centered about 4.10 ppm. The doublet at 1.31 ppm is typically quantified as the quartet may be suppressed through water saturation or obscured by residual water. In healthy subjects lactate is not visible, for its concentration is lower that the detection limit of MRS; however, presence of this peak indicates [[glycolysis]] has been initiated in an oxygen-deficient environment. Several causes of this include [[ischemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[mitochondrial disorder]]s, and some types of tumors.\n# [[Myo-inositol]]: with its major peak at 3.56 ppm, an increase in Myo-inositol has been seen to be disrupted in patients with Alzheimer's, dementia, and HIV patients.\n# [[Glutamate]] and [[glutamine]]: these amino acids are marked by a series of resonance peaks between 2.2 and 2.4 ppm. [[Hyperammonemia]], hepatic encephalopathy are two major conditions that result in elevated levels of glutamine and glutamate. MRS, used in conjunction with MRI or some other imaging technique, can be used to detect changes in the concentrations of these metabolites, or significantly abnormal concentrations of these metabolites.\n# [[GABA]] can be detected primarily from its peaks at approximately 3.0 ppm, however because creatine has a strong singlet at 3.0 ppm with approximately 20x the amplitude a technique which exploits [[J-coupling]] must be used to accurately quantify GABA. The most common techniques for this are J-difference editing (MEGA), or J-resolved (as used in JPRESS)\n# [[Glutathione]] can also be detected from its peak at peak at 3.0 ppm, however similar to GABA it also must use a method which exploits [[J-coupling]] to remove the overlaying creatine signal.\n\n==Limitations of MRS==\nThe major limitation to MRS is its low available signal due to the low concentration of metabolites as compared to water. As such, it has inherently poor temporal and spatial resolution. Nevertheless, no alternate technique is able to quantify metabolism in vivo non-invasively and thus MRS remains a valuable tool for research and clinical scientists. \n\n==Non-Proton (<sup>1</sup>H) MRS==\n''<u><sup>31</sup>Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</u>''\n\n<sup>1</sup>H MRS's clinical success is only rivaled by <sup>31</sup>P MRS. This is in large part because of the relatively high sensitivity of phosphorus NMR (7% of protons) combined with a 100% natural abundance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=90-93}}</ref>\nConsequently, high-quality spectra are acquired within minutes. Even at low field strengths, great spectra resolution is obtained because of the relatively large (~30 ppm) chemical shift dispersion for in vivo phosphates. Clinically, phosphorus NMR excels because it detects all metabolites playing key roles in tissue energy metabolism and can indirectly deduce intracellular pH. However, phosphorus NMR is chiefly challenged by the limited number of metabolites it can detect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=90-93}}</ref>\n\n''<u><sup>13</sup>Carbon Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</u>''\n\nIn contrast to phosphorus NMR, carbon NMR is an insensitive technique. This arises from the fact that <sup>13</sup>C NMR has a low abundance (1.1%) and carbon's low gyromagnetic ratio.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=93-96}}</ref> This low abundance is because <sup>12</sup>C does not have a magnetic moment, making it not NMR active, leading to <sup>13</sup>C's use for spectroscopy purposes. However, this low sensitivity can be improved via decoupling, averaging, polarization transfer, and larger volumes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=93-96}}</ref> Despite the low natural abundance and sensitivity of <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C MRS has been used to study several metabolites, especially glycogen and triglycerides.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=93-96}}</ref> It has proven especially useful at providing insight on the metabolic fluxes from <sup>13</sup>C-labeled precursors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=93-96}}</ref> There is great overlap in what <sup>1</sup>H MRS and <sup>13</sup>C MRS can obtain spectra-wise and large reason, combined with <sup>1</sup>H MRS's high sensitivity, why <sup>13</sup>C MRS has never seen wide application like <sup>1</sup>H MRS. See also [[Hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI]].\n\n<u><sup>''23''</sup>''Sodium Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy''</u>\n\nSodium NMR is infamous for its low sensitivity (9.2% relative to proton sensitivity) and low SNR because of its low sodium concentration (30 - 100 mM), especially compared to protons (40 - 50 M).<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=96-102}}</ref> However, interest in sodium NMR has been reinspired by recent significant gains in SNR at high magnetic fields, along with improved coil designs and optimized pulse sequences. There is much hope for sodium NMR's clinical potential because the detection of abnormal intracellular sodium in vivo may have significant diagnostic potential and reveal new insights into tissue electrolysis homeostasis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=96-102}}</ref> \n\n''<u><sup>19</sup>Fluorine Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</u>''\n\nFluorine NMR has high sensitivity (82% relative to proton sensitivity) and 100% natural abundance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Graaf |first1=Robin |title=In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119382546 |pages=102-104}}</ref> However, it is important to note that no endogenous <sup>19</sup>F containing compounds are found in biological tissues and thus the fluorine signal comes from an external reference compound.

A variety of up-coming [[Rock music|rock]] oriented bands were showcased live from small venues and broadcast simultaneously on television and radio during a 40-50 minute live performance.\n\nIt was a follow-on to the mid-1960s BBC series ''[[Jazz Goes to College (BBC)|Jazz Goes to College]]''.<ref>http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16502</ref>\n\n==Concert venues==\nThe venues were small [[university]], [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] or [[college]] halls holding a few thousand people; often tickets were given to the [[Students' Union]] to distribute for free. The bands chosen were also, in some cases, bands which did not have a mainstream following at that time{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} although many went on to be very successful.\n\nA BBC [[DJ]] would also be present to introduce the band for the television audience.\n\n==Innovation==\nThe original broadcasts were transmitted on television as well as [[Sight and Sound in Concert]]; a BBC initiative to provide simultaneous pictures on [[BBC2]] and [[stereo]] radio broadcasts on [[BBC Radio 1]], as stereo television broadcasts and receivers did not exist at the time. It allowed rock enthusiasts to enjoy the event with an improved sound quality.\n\n==Recordings==\nOriginal recordings of at least some of the ''Rock Goes to College'' series still exist and some legal releases have been made available, on DVD or CD, either as the concert in its entirety or as part of a compilation. [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]] has re-broadcast some of the programmes (in stereo on television) in 2006 as has [[BBC Four]] and [[Alibi (TV channel)|UK Arena]] in the late 1990s.\n\nIn some cases, the radio broadcasts contained additional songs to those broadcast via the television including pre-broadcast/warm-up tracks.\n\n==Concert listing==\nMany performances have been [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] from the original tapes or from public television/radio broadcasts.

Very few of these concerts seem to have made it to legal DVD (such as the Bill Bruford, both John Martyn and a sample of AC/DC).\n\nBootlegs exist created from original TV (although very few domestic video recorders were around at the time) and radio broadcasts (through cassette tapes) as well as subsequent repeats. In particular, the AC/DC, Specials, Robin Trower, Ian Gillan, Cars, Police and U2 DVDs, CDs and tapes are commonly found advertised on trader's sites.\n\nSome of the shows, such as AC/DC and The Police, have been recently broadcast on VH1 Classic on the show ''BBC Crown Jewels''.\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16502 Rock Goes to College] from the [[British Film Institute]] Film & TV Database\n* [http://www.whom.co.uk/dora/rockgoes.htm Partial listing of RGTC concerts] from whom.co.uk\n\n[[Category:British music television programmes]]\n[[Category:Rock music television series]]\n[[Category:1978 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1981 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s British music television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British music television series]]\n[[Category:BBC Television programmes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2012}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Rock Goes To College\n| image                = \n| caption              = \n| show_name_2          = \n| genre                = \n| creator              = \n| developer            = \n| writer               = \n| director             = [[John Burrowes]]\n| creative_director    = \n| presenter            = [[Pete Drummond]]\n| starring             = \n| judges               = \n| voices               = \n| narrated             =\n| theme_music_composer = \n| opentheme            = \n| endtheme             = \n| composer             = \n| country              = United Kingdom\n| language             = \n| num_series           = 4\n| num_episodes         = \n| list_episodes        = \n| executive_producer   = \n| producer             = [[Michael Appleton (producer)|Michael Appleton]]\n| editor               = \n| location             = \n| cinematography       = \n| camera               = \n| runtime              = \n| company              = \n| distributor          = \n| channel              = [[BBC Two|BBC2]]\n| picture_format       = \n| audio_format         = \n| first_run            = \n| first_aired          = 22 September 1978\n| last_aired           = 19 March 1981\n| status               = \n| preceded_by          = ''[[Jazz Goes to College (BBC)|Jazz Goes to College]]''\n| followed_by          = \n| related              = \n| website              = \n| production_website   = \n}}\n'''''Rock Goes to College''''' (RGTC) was a [[BBC]] series that ran between 1978 and 1981 on [[British television]]. A variety of up-coming [[Rock music|rock]] oriented bands were showcased live from small venues and broadcast simultaneously on television and radio during a 40-50 minute live performance.\n\nIt was a follow-on to the mid-1960s BBC series ''[[Jazz Goes to College (BBC)|Jazz Goes to College]]''.<ref>http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16502</ref>\n\n==Concert venues==\nThe venues were small [[university]], [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] or [[college]] halls holding a few thousand people; often tickets were given to the [[Students' Union]] to distribute for free. The bands chosen were also, in some cases, bands which did not have a mainstream following at that time{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} although many went on to be very successful.\n\nA BBC [[DJ]] would also be present to introduce the band for the television audience.\n\n==Innovation==\nThe original broadcasts were transmitted on television as well as [[Sight and Sound in Concert]]; a BBC initiative to provide simultaneous pictures on [[BBC2]] and [[stereo]] radio broadcasts on [[BBC Radio 1]], as stereo television broadcasts and receivers did not exist at the time. It allowed rock enthusiasts to enjoy the event with an improved sound quality.\n\n==Recordings==\nOriginal recordings of at least some of the ''Rock Goes to College'' series still exist and some legal releases have been made available, on DVD or CD, either as the concert in its entirety or as part of a compilation. [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]] has re-broadcast some of the programmes (in stereo on television) in 2006 as has [[BBC Four]] and [[Alibi (TV channel)|UK Arena]] in the late 1990s.\n\nIn some cases, the radio broadcasts contained additional songs to those broadcast via the television including pre-broadcast/warm-up tracks.\n\n==Concert listing==\nMany performances have been [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] from the original tapes or from public television/radio broadcasts.

Very few of these concerts seem to have made it to legal DVD (such as the Bill Bruford, both John Martyn and a sample of AC/DC).\n\nBootlegs exist created from original TV (although very few domestic video recorders were around at the time) and radio broadcasts (through cassette tapes) as well as subsequent repeats. In particular, the AC/DC, Specials, Robin Trower, Ian Gillan, Cars, Police and U2 DVDs, CDs and tapes are commonly found advertised on trader's sites.\n\nSome of the shows, such as AC/DC and The Police, have been recently broadcast on VH1 Classic on the show ''BBC Crown Jewels''.\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16502 Rock Goes to College] from the [[British Film Institute]] Film & TV Database\n* [http://www.whom.co.uk/dora/rockgoes.htm Partial listing of RGTC concerts] from whom.co.uk\n\n[[Category:British music television programmes]]\n[[Category:Rock music television series]]\n[[Category:1978 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1981 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s British music television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British music television series]]\n[[Category:BBC Television programmes]]\n", "name_user": "Ghmyrtle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Goes_to_College"}

Some embassies serve both functions, while other countries open separate embassies for both.\n\n{{-}}\n\n== Embassies ==\n'''Brussels'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*{{AFG}}\n*{{ALB}}\n*{{ALG}}\n*{{AND}}\n*{{ANG}}\n*{{ARG}}\n*{{ARM}}\n*{{AUS}}\n*{{AUT}}\n*{{AZE}}\n*{{BAH}}\n*{{BHR}}\n*{{BAN}}\n*{{BAR}}\n*{{BLR}}\n*{{BIZ}}\n*{{BEN}}\n*{{BHU}}\n*{{BOL}}\n*{{BIH}}\n*{{BOT}}\n*{{BRA}}\n*{{BRU}}\n*{{BUL}}\n*{{BUR}}\n*{{BDI}}\n*{{CAM}}\n*{{CMR}}\n*{{CAN}}\n*{{CPV}}\n*{{CAF}}\n*{{CHA}}\n*{{CHI}}\n*{{CHN}}\n*{{COL}}\n*{{COM}}\n*{{COD}}\n*{{CGO}}\n*{{CRC}}\n*{{CRO}}\n*{{CUB}}\n*{{CZE}}\n*{{DEN}}\n*{{DJI}}\n*{{DMA}}\n*{{DOM}}\n*{{Flag|East Timor}}\n{{col-break}}\n*{{ECU}} \n*{{EGY}}\n*{{Flag|Eswatini}}\n*{{ESA}}\n*{{GEQ}}\n*{{ERI}}\n*{{EST}}\n*{{ETH}}\n*{{FIJ}}\n*{{FIN}}\n*{{FRA}}\n*{{GAB}}\n*{{GAM}}\n*{{GEO}}\n*{{GER}}\n*{{GHA}}\n*{{GRN}}\n*{{GRE}}\n*{{GUA}}\n*{{GUI}}\n*{{GBS}}\n*{{GUY}}\n*{{HAI}}\n*{{Flag|Holy See}}\n*{{HON}}\n*{{HUN}}\n*{{ISL}}\n*{{IND}}\n*{{INA}}\n*{{IRI}}\n*{{IRQ}}\n*{{IRL}}\n*{{ISR}}\n*{{ITA}}\n*{{Flag|Ivory Coast}}\n*{{JAM}}\n*{{JPN}}\n*{{JOR}}\n*{{KAZ}}\n*{{KEN}}\n*{{XKX}}\n*{{KUW}}\n*{{KGZ}}\n*{{LAO}}\n*{{LAT}}\n*{{LIB}}\n*{{LES}}\n{{col-break}}\n*{{LBR}}\n*{{LBA}}\n*{{LIE}}\n*{{LTU}}\n*{{LUX}}\n*{{MAD}}\n*{{MAW}}\n*{{MAS}}\n*{{MDV}}\n*{{MLI}}\n*{{MLT}}\n*{{MTN}}\n*{{MRI}}\n*{{MEX}}\n*{{MDA}}\n*{{MON}}\n*{{MGL}}\n*{{Flag|Montenegro}}\n*{{MAR}}\n*{{MOZ}}\n*{{MMR}}\n*{{NAM}}\n*{{NEP}}\n*{{NED}}\n*{{NZL}}\n*{{NCA}}\n*{{NIG}}\n*{{NGR}}\n*{{NMK}}\n*{{NOR}}\n*{{OMA}}\n*{{PAK}}\n*{{Flag|Palau}}\n*{{PAN}}\n*{{PNG}}\n*{{PAR}}\n*{{PER}}\n*{{PHI}}\n*{{POL}}\n*{{POR}}\n*{{QAT}}\n*{{ROU}}\n*{{RUS}}\n*{{RWA}}\n*{{SKN}}\n*{{LCA}}\n*{{VIN}}\n{{col-break}}\n*{{SAM}}\n*{{SMR}}\n*{{STP}}\n*{{KSA}}\n*{{SEN}}\n*{{SRB}}\n*{{SYC}}\n*{{SLE}}\n*{{SGP}}\n*{{SVK}}\n*{{SLO}}\n*{{SOL}}\n*{{SOM}}\n*{{RSA}}\n*{{KOR}}\n*{{SSD}}\n*{{ESP}}\n*{{SRI}}\n*{{SUD}}\n*{{SUR}}\n*{{SUI}}\n*{{TJK}}\n*{{TAN}}\n*{{THA}}\n*{{TOG}}\n*{{TRI}}\n*{{TUN}}\n*{{TUR}}\n*{{TKM}}\n*{{TUV}}\n*{{UGA}}\n*{{UKR}}\n*{{UAE}}\n*{{GBR}}\n*{{USA}}\n*{{URU}}\n*{{UZB}}\n*{{VUT}}\n*{{VEN}}\n*{{VNM}}\n*{{YEM}}\n*{{ZAM}}\n*{{ZIM}}\n|}\n\n== Representative Offices and Delegations ==\n* {{flag|Kurdistan}}  (Representative Office)<ref>http://www.dfr.gov.krd/p/p.aspx?p=210&l=12&r=364</ref>\n* {{GRL}} (Kingdom of Denmark) -

They are considered to be one of the pioneering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in Bangladesh along with [[Rockstrata]]. Multiple changes have taken place in membership since its founding since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums, including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition, they have released several singles in band mixed albums.\n\nThe band has experimented with different subgenres of hard rock and heavy metal over the years like progressive metal. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s adapting the styles of fast [[arpeggios]], [[sweep picking]], [[tapping]] led the band's sound into [[neoclassical metal]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ferdous |first=Fahim |date=23 December 2017 |title='It's not worth dying on stage' |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/music/its-not-worth-dying-stage-1508878 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== First decade and breakthrough \u2013 \"Warfaze\" and \"\u0985\u09ac\u09be\u0995 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09cb\u09ac\u09be\u09b8\u09be (Astonishing Love)\" (1984\u201394) ===\n\nThe first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and Naimul on guitars, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] on bass, Helal on drums. This initial line-up underwent the first of many changes with Helal, Mir, and Bappi having to leave the band for personal reasons. The band was far from breaking through to the mainstream music scene in Bangladesh. Heavy metal music was not much popular in Bangladesh back then.<ref name=\"Warfaze Biography\">{{cite web|title=Warfaze Biography|url=http://banglamusic.com/artists/warfaze/|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1985, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] took up lead guitar duties for the band at this stage and the rest of the positions were filled with Babna Karim as the bassist, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu as drummer, and e\nReshad as the vocalist. This second line up had to be discontinued when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other Dhaka-based metal bands: [[Rockstrata]], In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman and Fuad of In Dhaka volunteered to help Warfaze as guest members. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]] or [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"In Conversation with Warfaze\">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archivedate=16 June 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Rashed had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', in 1991. The album featured the songs \"Boshe Achi Eka\" and \"Ekti Chele\". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several weeks for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.\n\nThe album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. By this time, [[Russel Ali]] had joined them on keyboards. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s guitar skills got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n=== \"\u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be (Living System)\" and \"\u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u0995 (Antisocial)\" (1994\u20131998) ===\n\nThe band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1997, the last time the line-up of Sunjoy, Babna Karim, Russel Ali, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]; Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad would play together on the same album.\n\n[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and vocalist from another heavy metal band, Legend.

This line-up released the album ''[[Aalo (album)|\u0986\u09b2\u09cb (Light)]]'' in 2001.\n\nHowever, 2002 saw marked changes in the line-up once again with Mizan leaving the band for personal reasons and Kamal taking a break after almost 20 years of continued activity. Kamal joined Sumon's band Aurthohin in 2006. Balam, who already sang three notable songs in the album 'Alo' took up vocal duties and Sazzadwas recruited from ''Metal Maze'' as the lead guitarist. All the while, Tipu held the band together and recruited the services of C\u00e9zanne, bassist of the emerging progressive metal band [[Artcell]]. Later Balam departed to pursue a solo career as a commercial pop artist. Besides,Balam sang songs like Joto Dure,Moharaj,Asha,Shadhikar,cyclone etc. which are very tough to,perform by any vocal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Balam|url=http://banglamusic.com/interviews/interview-with-balam-403.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nKamal rejoined the band in 2007 and recruited Oni Hasan of the band Vibe, resulting in a major change in their sound, with [[neoclassical metal]] influences especially in live performances.

[[Bangladeshi heavy metal]] band formed in 1984 in [[Dhaka]] by guitarist [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]. They are considered to be one of the pioneering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in Bangladesh along with [[Rockstrata]]. Multiple changes have taken place in membership since its founding since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums, including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition, they have released several singles in band mixed albums.\n\nThe band has experimented with different subgenres of hard rock and heavy metal over the years like progressive metal. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s adapting the styles of fast [[arpeggios]], [[sweep picking]], [[tapping]] led the band's sound into [[neoclassical metal]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ferdous |first=Fahim |date=23 December 2017 |title='It's not worth dying on stage' |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/music/its-not-worth-dying-stage-1508878 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== First decade and breakthrough \u2013 \"Warfaze\" and \"\u0985\u09ac\u09be\u0995 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09cb\u09ac\u09be\u09b8\u09be (Astonishing Love)\" (1984\u201394) ===\n\nThe first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and Naimul on guitars, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] on bass, Helal on drums. This initial line-up underwent the first of many changes with Helal, Mir, and Bappi having to leave the band for personal reasons. The band was far from breaking through to the mainstream music scene in Bangladesh. Heavy metal music was not much popular in Bangladesh back then.<ref name=\"Warfaze Biography\">{{cite web|title=Warfaze Biography|url=http://banglamusic.com/artists/warfaze/|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1985, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] took up lead guitar duties for the band at this stage and the rest of the positions were filled with Babna Karim as the bassist, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu as drummer, and e\nReshad as the vocalist. This second line up had to be discontinued when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other Dhaka-based metal bands: [[Rockstrata]], In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman and Fuad of In Dhaka volunteered to help Warfaze as guest members. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]] or [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"In Conversation with Warfaze\">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archivedate=16 June 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Rashed had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', in 1991. The album featured the songs \"Boshe Achi Eka\" and \"Ekti Chele\". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several weeks for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.\n\nThe album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. By this time, [[Russel Ali]] had joined them on keyboards. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s guitar skills got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n=== \"\u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be (Living System)\" and \"\u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u0995 (Antisocial)\" (1994\u20131998) ===\n\nThe band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1997, the last time the line-up of Sunjoy, Babna Karim, Russel Ali, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]; Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad would play together on the same album.\n\n[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and vocalist from another heavy metal band, Legend.

This line-up released the album ''[[Aalo (album)|\u0986\u09b2\u09cb (Light)]]'' in 2001.\n\nHowever, 2002 saw marked changes in the line-up once again with Mizan leaving the band for personal reasons and Kamal taking a break after almost 20 years of continued activity. Kamal joined Sumon's band Aurthohin in 2006. Balam, who already sang three notable songs in the album 'Alo' took up vocal duties and Sazzadwas recruited from ''Metal Maze'' as the lead guitarist. All the while, Tipu held the band together and recruited the services of C\u00e9zanne, bassist of the emerging progressive metal band [[Artcell]]. Later Balam departed to pursue a solo career as a commercial pop artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Balam|url=http://banglamusic.com/interviews/interview-with-balam-403.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nKamal rejoined the band in 2007 and recruited Oni Hasan of the band Vibe, resulting in a major change in their sound, with [[neoclassical metal]] influences especially in live performances.
