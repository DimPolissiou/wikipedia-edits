The company she started, [[Beate Uhse AG]], is listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].\n\n==Early life==\nUhse was born in Wargenau, a neighborhood of [[Zelenogradsk|Cranz]], [[East Prussia]] (now [[Zelenogradsk]], Russia). She was the youngest of three children of the farmer Otto K\u00f6stlin and the doctor Magarete K\u00f6stlin (one of the first five female doctors in Germany).\n\nWhen she was eight years old, her older brother told her the myth of [[Icarus]]. Beate was fascinated by the story, and by the idea of flying\u2014so much so that she gathered chicken feathers and glued together some wings and jumped from her parents' veranda. Beate was a wild child. Her parents did not try to control her; instead they encouraged their daughter in her interests and desires. They assisted her in getting a good education. They informed their children on sexual matters early, and spoke with them openly about sexuality and contraception. At 15, Beate became the Hessian javelin champion.\n\n== Civil aviation ==\nAt 16, Beate K\u00f6stlin went to [[England]] for a year to learn [[English language|English]] as an [[au pair]]. Afterwards, she returned to her parents' home where, to satisfy her parents, she obtained a \"proper\" education (in [[Home Economics]]). During a trip to Berlin, her father met a Mr. Sachsenberg, a lecturer on motor sports from the German Aero-Club (a nonprofit organization dedicated to flying), and complained to him of his \"flying-crazy\" daughter and the \"nonsensical\" concept of a female pilot. Sachsenberg was, instead, excited by the idea, and sent the seventeen-year-old Beate information about obtaining a pilot's license.\n\nFinally her parents gave in to her demands, and in 1937 she joined the [[Rangsdorf]] pilot school near [[Berlin]]. In October of that year, on her 18th birthday, she received her pilot's license. In 1938, she passed the stunt pilot exam, and shortly thereafter competed in a race in [[Belgium]]. She won in her category, and also won 2nd place overall in target landing and 3rd in \"punctual flight.\"\n\nShe then worked for the [[B\u00fccker Flugzeugbau|B\u00fccker]] aircraft company in Rangsdorf as a test pilot and subsequently, at age 19, as a delivery pilot for the Alfred Friedrich aircraft concern in [[Strausberg]], east of Berlin. Soon afterwards, she was asked by the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] film company to work as a stunt double in films. She worked with [[Hans Albers]], a film star she particularly admired, and with numerous others. In the German propaganda movie ''Achtung \u2013 Feind h\u00f6rt mit'' she performed a stunt as a double for German actor [[Ren\u00e9 Deltgen]], in which she flew through a balloon barrier and simulated an uncontrolled dive.\n\nBeate fell in love with her stunt-piloting instructor, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Uhse, but repeatedly rejected his proposals of marriage. She swore she would \"never ever give up flying for a man.\" Since Hans-J\u00fcrgen strongly supported her ambitions, however, she finally accepted, but her father resisted. For one whole year, her father refused to bless their union. Finally, a festive wedding was scheduled for 10 October 1939. However, it had to be canceled because of the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. On 28 September, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Uhse was to be posted; the couple married quietly four hours before his departure.\n\n== Luftwaffe transport pilot ==\nDuring the war stunt piloting became impossible, and Beate Uhse was grounded. In her small home in [[Rangsdorf]] she felt claustrophobic, and so she accepted an offer by the [[Luftwaffe]] to work in an aircraft ferrying unit. Thus, she was occasionally also able to fly combat aircraft that she otherwise would not be allowed to fly: the [[Junkers Ju 87 Stuka]], the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|110]], the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and at the end of the war even the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], the world's first operational jet fighter. Although attacked several times by allied aircraft she continued as she felt that after the war, with this experience, she would be able to have a career as a pilot.\n\nIn 1943, her son Klaus was born. After the birth, she was permitted to continue flying because she was in a role considered vital to the war effort, and she received permission to hire a nanny.\n\nIn October 1944, she was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] and was assigned to the ''\u00dcberf\u00fchrungsgeschwader 1'' (Ferry Squadron 1) based in Berlin-[[Staaken]].\n\nIn 1945, her husband Hans-J\u00fcrgen died in an air crash, leaving Beate a 24-year-old widow with a year-old son.\n\nOn April 1945, Berlin was [[Battle of Berlin|surrounded by Soviet forces]]. The commander of Uhse's squadron wanted to move the battalion west. Uhse made her way through the ravaged city to her house in Rangsdorf and picked up her son and his nanny, but when she brought them to the airport, her unit had already left, along with her airplane. She found a small [[Siebel Fh 104]] plane that did not have a pilot, and while it was being fueled she studied the plane's manual, as she had never flown this type. Together with two injured \u2013 her son and the nanny \u2013 she left embattled Berlin flying northwest, finally landing in [[Leck, Nordfriesland|Leck]] in [[North Friesland]]. There she was captured by British forces.\n\nAfter her release, she settled in [[Flensburg]], in what would become West Germany, with her son.\n\n== Businesswoman ==\n[[File:Beate Uhse Hamburger Stra\u00dfe2.jpg|thumb|A Beate Uhse shop in Hamburg, Germany]]\nIn the early postwar period, former members of the Luftwaffe were not permitted to fly, and Uhse's aviation career ended.  First, she made a living on the black market.  She was selling products door-to-door and met many housewives and learned of their problems: former soldiers returning from the war were making their wives pregnant, not caring that there was \"no apartment, no income and no future\" for any children.  Many of the women went to untrained abortionists.  Uhse remembered lectures her mother (who had died during the war) had given her on sexuality, sexual hygiene and contraception.  She searched for information on the Knaus-Ogino rhythm method of contraception, and put together a brochure which explained to the women how to identify their fertile and infertile days.\n\nBy 1947, she had sold 32,000 copies of \"Pamphlet X\" via her \"Betu\" mail order company, and began to expand to larger cities such as Hamburg and Bremen.  Many people wrote her letters asking for advice on sexuality and eroticism.  \"These people were unaware of the facts of life,\" she wrote in her autobiography.  Soon she was also selling condoms and \"marriage guides.\"\n\nIn 1951, with four employees, she started the [[Beate Uhse AG|Beate Uhse Mail Order Co.]], offering condoms and books on \"marital hygiene.\" Two years later, the company had 14 employees.  Uhse married retailer Ernst-Walter Rotermund and had a second child, Ulrich.\n\nIn 1962, in Flensburg, she opened her \"speciality store for marital hygiene\" largely focused on [[sexuality]], thus considered as the first [[sex shop]]. She offered, both in her store and her catalog, more \"articles for marital hygiene.\"  Soon the police began acting against the items in her store which supposedly served to \"inflame and satisfy lustful desires in a manner contrary to decency and morality.\"  By 1992, her store had been indicted more than 2,000 times.  She was also discriminated against by other organizations, including the \"B\u00f6rsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels\" (a financial organization of the German book industry), which refused to admit her publishing house due to \"moral concerns.\"  The Flensburger tennis club refused to admit her due to \"general concerns.\"\n\nIn 1979, she divorced her second husband.  In 1983, she was diagnosed with stomach [[cancer]], but survived.  At age 75 she obtained a diving licence.  In 1996, she fulfilled a long-held dream, and opened the [[Beate Uhse Erotic Museum]] in [[Berlin]].  Three years later, in 1999, her company, [[Beate Uhse AG]], was listed on the German stock exchange and was met with great interest in the financial community.  The stock was oversubscribed 64 times in its [[initial public offering|IPO]].  The original stock certificates are greatly desired because of the depiction of two scantily dressed women.\n\nThe Beate Uhse business continues to trade throughout Europe under the names [https://www.beate-uhse.com Beate Uhse], [https://www.pabo.nl Pabo] and [https://www.adameteve.fr Adam et Eve]. It went into administration on multiple occasions, most recently in July 2019, owing money to Google for its Pay Per Click advertising. \n\nUhse died of [[pneumonia]] in a clinic in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]], in 2001.\n\nUhse was one of the most important people for sexual liberation in the German-speaking world.  In 1989 she received the \"[[Bundesverdienstkreuz]]\" (German Cross of Merit).\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Commons category|Beate Uhse}}\n* Beate Uhse und Ulrich Pramann: Ich will Freiheit f\u00fcr die Liebe \u2014 Beate Uhse [''Beate Uhse: I Want Freedom For Love''].

Built in 1914, in the next 80 years she had participated in a famous Arctic rescue, been present at a great maritime tragedy, and been employed as a halibut schooner, a rum runner, a pilot boat, a yacht, and a crabber. She sank in high seas, without loss of life, in 1994.\n\n==Construction==\n''King & Winge'' was originally a powered [[halibut]] [[schooner]] built by the [[King and Winge Shipbuilding Company|King and Winge shipyard]] in [[West Seattle]] in 1914.  She was designed by Albert M. Winge, co-owner of the shipyard.<ref name=\"Jacobi\">Jacobi, Wayne, \"King & Winge: Versatile Ship Comes Home,\" Seattle Times, January 5, 1962, page 33.</ref>  Her dimensions were 143 tons, 97' length on the deck (110' overall), 19.6' beam and 9.7 depth of hold.

Built in 1914, in the next 80 years she had participated in a famous Arctic rescue, been present at a great maritime tragedy, and been employed as a halibut schooner, a rum runner, a pilot boat, a yacht, and a crabber. She sank in high seas, without loss of life, in 1994.\n\n==Construction==\n''King & Winge'' was originally a powered [[halibut]] [[schooner]] built by the [[King and Winge Shipbuilding Company|King and Winge shipyard]] in [[West Seattle]] in 1914.

Though the band formed in Wales, none of the members are [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. The band has gone through several lineup changes during their career, with their current lineup consisting of Gareth Campesinos! (lead vocals, lyrics), Neil Campesinos! (guitar), Tom Campesinos! (guitar), Rob Campesinos! (guitar, other instruments), Kim Campesinos! (keyboards, vocals), Matt Campesinos! (bass) and Jason Campesinos! (drums). Gareth, Neil and Tom are the only remaining original members still in the band.\n\nThe band released their debut album, ''[[Hold on Now, Youngster...]]'', in February 2008 and followed this up by releasing their second album, ''[[We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed]]'', in October that year. The band had previously referred to this release as a 'record' or an 'extended [[extended play|EP]]',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gareth-campesinos-of-los-campesinos,14340/|title=Gareth Campesinos of Los Campesinos!|publisher=}}</ref> before ultimately deciding to refer to it as their second album out of simplicity.<ref name=\"noisey1\">{{cite web|last1=Garland|first1=Emma|title=Los Campesinos!

The band's earliest compositions were long pieces in the style of [[post-rock]], though no recordings from this era are known to circulate publicly. The word ''[[wikt:campesino|campesino]]'' in Spanish translates to \"peasant\" or \"country person\". All members of the band refer to their surnames as \"Campesinos!\"\n\nThe band performed their first gig on 8 May 2006 at a student union club night; they went on to play a number of increasingly well-received gigs around Cardiff. An early [[Demo (music)|demo]] was recorded featuring the songs \"Death To Los Campesinos!\", \"It Started With A Mixx\", \"Sweet Dreams Sweet Cheeks\", and \"You! Me! Dancing!\". The songs were posted on the [[internet]], bolstering the popularity established by their energetic live shows and earning them airplay on [[Huw Stephens]]'s evening show on [[BBC Radio 1]] Wales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The band's reputation continued to grow, and in August 2006 landed them a slot supporting Canadian [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Broken Social Scene]].
