It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterward, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterward, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone

Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|seventh season]], which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\n\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the [[Night King]] and his army of [[White Walkers]] and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat [[Cersei Lannister]] as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' and ''[[A Dream of Spring]]''. The season was adapted for television by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\nThe season was met with poor reviews from critics, in contrast to the widespread acclaim of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|seventh season]], which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\n\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the [[Night King]] and his army of [[White Walkers]] and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat [[Cersei Lannister]] as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' and ''[[A Dream of Spring]]''. The season was adapted for television by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\nThe season was met with mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the widespread acclaim of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Criticism was mainly directed at the writing and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners; though the acting, production, and musical score continued to receive praise.\n\nThe season received 32 nominations at the [[71st Primetime Emmy Awards]], the most for a single season of television in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/awards/emmy-nominations-2019-game-of-thrones-analysis-netflix-hbo-1203268722/ |title=Emmys 2019 Nominations: HBO Back at the Top, as 'Game of Thrones' Makes History |work=Variety |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=July 16, 2019 |accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> It won twelve, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] for [[Peter Dinklage]].\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--Summaries should not be over 200 words per WP:TVPLOT.

At House Umber's seat of Last Hearth, Tormund and Beric encounter Edd and other Night's Watch members. They find the castle's occupants dead, and the wight of Ned Umber is left as a gruesome message.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[British government]]. The role of the Governor is to act as the ''de facto'' [[head of state]], and he or she is responsible for appointing the [[Premier of Bermuda|Premier]] and the 11 members of the [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] (the upper house of [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermuda's Parliament]]).\n\nThe Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, in control of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (all that remains of the [[Bermuda Garrison]]). Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda.\n\nThe current Governor is [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016.\n\nThe Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a [[Union Flag]] with the [[Coat of Arms of Bermuda|territory's coat of arms]] superimposed.\n\n==History==\nBermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], the ''[[Sea Venture]]''. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to [[Virginia]], the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|first stone forts in the English New World]], and developing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]]. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a ''Counsell of Six'' to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among three men who had first arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]. He had remained behind with Robert Waters when the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and remained again with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned from Jamestown and departed once more in the same year for England).\n\nBermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, [[Jamestown, Virginia]]). Bermuda was administered under [[Royal charter]]s by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain [[Daniel Tucker (colonial administrator)|Daniel Tucker]] was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the ''George'', in consort with the ''Edwin'', to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the position.\n\nThe Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single [[House of Assembly]], which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the [[Senate of Bermuda]], with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company-appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British State]] was created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important [[Royal Navy]] base, with a large [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]] to guard it.<ref>\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795\u20131975\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum</ref> As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval dockyard]] in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor \u2013 the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives.\n\nPrior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, ''only'') [[House (legislature)|house]] of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]], the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were ''on their way to England, or [[Davy Jones' Locker]], either place being preferable'' to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the ''overplus'' (surplus) land left after [[Richard Norwood]]'s 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as ''The Grove'', would still be in the hands of his relatives during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nFor the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as [[William Sayle]] from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. With control of \"the Army\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the [[Somers Isles Company]]'s Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. \n\nGovernors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges ''bush lawyers'', however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.<ref>\"Bermuda in Three Colours\", Carveth Wells. Robert M. McBride & Company, New York. 1935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Government House, Mount Langton.jpg|thumb|left|Government House, Mount Langton. This became Government House when the colonial capital was moved from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] to the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds.]]\nAt the written request of [[George Washington]], during the course of the [[American War of Independence]], 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker of The Grove]] (the ''overplus'' estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] while attending the rebel [[Continental Congress]] as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named ''Henry Tucker'', was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor [[George James Bruere]]. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government.\n\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda]], on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO]]\nWith the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors \u2013 appointed by the Crown \u2013 remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795.\n\nAttempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the [[Secretary of State for War]] found a lever (the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]]) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).<ref>\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\", Jennifer M.

In 1939, the Governor, General Sir [[Reginald Hildyard]], resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the [[First World War]], following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including [[Woodrow Wilson]]).\n\nOn 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, [[Richard Sharples]], and his aide-de-camp Captain [[Hugh Sayers]], were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book-keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.\n\n==List of Governors of Bermuda==\n[[File:George James Bruere.png|thumb|[[George James Bruere]], in office from 1764 to 1780, the longest-serving of all Bermuda's Governors]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# 1612\u20131616 Richard Moore (Deputy Governor in Bermuda.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[British government]]. The role of the Governor is to act as the ''de facto'' [[head of state]], and he or she is responsible for appointing the [[Premier of Bermuda|Premier]] and the 11 members of the [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] (the upper house of [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermuda's Parliament]]).\n\nThe Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, in control of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (all that remains of the [[Bermuda Garrison]]). Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda.\n\nThe current Governor is [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016.\n\nThe Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a [[Union Flag]] with the [[Coat of Arms of Bermuda|territory's coat of arms]] superimposed.\n\n==History==\nBermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], the ''[[Sea Venture]]''. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to [[Virginia]], the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|first stone forts in the English New World]], and developing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]]. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a ''Counsell of Six'' to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among three men who had first arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]. He had remained behind with Robert Waters when the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and remained again with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned from Jamestown and departed once more in the same year for England).\n\nBermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, [[Jamestown, Virginia]]). Bermuda was administered under [[Royal charter]]s by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain [[Daniel Tucker (colonial administrator)|Daniel Tucker]] was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the ''George'', in consort with the ''Edwin'', to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the position.\n\nThe Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single [[House of Assembly]], which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the [[Senate of Bermuda]], with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company-appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British State]] was created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important [[Royal Navy]] base, with a large [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]] to guard it.<ref>\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795\u20131975\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum</ref> As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval dockyard]] in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor \u2013 the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives.\n\nPrior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, ''only'') [[House (legislature)|house]] of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]], the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were ''on their way to England, or [[Davy Jones' Locker]], either place being preferable'' to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the ''overplus'' (surplus) land left after [[Richard Norwood]]'s 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as ''The Grove'', would still be in the hands of his relatives during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nFor the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as [[William Sayle]] from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. With control of \"the Army\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the [[Somers Isles Company]]'s Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. \n\nGovernors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges ''bush lawyers'', however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.<ref>\"Bermuda in Three Colours\", Carveth Wells. Robert M.

This became Government House when the colonial capital was moved from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] to the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds.]]\nAt the written request of [[George Washington]], during the course of the [[American War of Independence]], 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker of The Grove]] (the ''overplus'' estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] while attending the rebel [[Continental Congress]] as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named ''Henry Tucker'', was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor [[George James Bruere]]. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government.\n\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda]], on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO]]\nWith the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors \u2013 appointed by the Crown \u2013 remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795.\n\nAttempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the [[Secretary of State for War]] found a lever (the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]]) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).<ref>\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\", Jennifer M.

Itself using as a source the unique, typescript \"History of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, 1891\u20131933\", held at the Bermuda Library, in Hamilton.</ref> Struggles between the Governor and the Parliament would continue to recur. In 1939, the Governor, General Sir [[Reginald Hildyard]], resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the [[First World War]], following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including [[Woodrow Wilson]]).\n\nOn 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, [[Richard Sharples]], and his aide-de-camp Captain [[Hugh Sayers]], were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book-keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.\n\n==List of Governors of Bermuda==\n[[File:George James Bruere.png|thumb|[[George James Bruere]], in office from 1764 to 1780, the longest-serving of all Bermuda's Governors]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# 1612\u20131616 Richard Moore (Deputy Governor in Bermuda.

On 20 January 1947 ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch'' became ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Dassault'' to reflect the name adopted by its owner.\n\nIn 1954, Dassault established an electronics division (by 1962 named ''Electronique Marcel Dassault''), the first action of which was to begin development of airborne radars, soon followed by seeker heads for air-to-air missiles, navigation, and bombing aids. From the 1950s to late 1970s exports become a major part of Dassault's business, major successes were the [[Dassault Mirage]] series and the [[Dassault Falcon|Mystere-Falcon]].\n\nIn 1965 and 1966, the French government stressed to its various defense suppliers the need to specialize to maintain viable companies.

In 1944 Bloch was deported to the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp by the German occupiers where he remained until it was liberated on 11 April 1945.\n\nOn 10 November 1945, at an extraordinary general meeting of the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Avions Marcel Bloch'' the company voted to change its form to a limited liability entity, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch'', which was to be a holding company. On 20 January 1947 ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch'' became ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Dassault'' to reflect the name adopted by its owner.\n\nIn 1954, Dassault established an electronics division (by 1962 named ''Electronique Marcel Dassault''), the first action of which was to begin development of airborne radars, soon followed by seeker heads for air-to-air missiles, navigation, and bombing aids. From the 1950s to late 1970s exports become a major part of Dassault's business, major successes were the [[Dassault Mirage]] series and the [[Dassault Falcon|Mystere-Falcon]].\n\nIn 1965 and 1966, the French government stressed to its various defense suppliers the need to specialize to maintain viable companies. Dassault was to specialise in combat and business aircraft, [[Nord Aviation]] in [[ballistic missiles]] and [[Sud Aviation]] civil and military transport aircraft and [[helicopter]]s.<ref>Dassault Aviation ''[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/passion/gb/dassault_a_a_z/histoire_aviation/1965_1986/1965_1986_a.cfm History, 1916 to this day: The company's successive reorganizations]''.

Under the merger deal Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Dassault was dissolved on 14 December 1971, with its assets vested in Breguet, to be renamed Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA).\n[[File:Dassault Falcon 900 and Dassault Falcon 7X at Genoa Airport.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Dassault Falcon 900]] and a [[Dassault Falcon 7X]] [[business jet]] ]]\n[[Dassault Syst\u00e8mes]] was established in 1981 to develop and market Dassault's [[CAD program]], [[CATIA]].

In 1998 the French government transferred its shares in Dassault Aviation (45.76%) to Aerospatiale. On 10 July 2000, A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra merged with other European companies to form [[EADS]] (presently [[Airbus]]).\n\nIn 2000 [[Serge Dassault]] resigned as chairman and was succeeded by Charles Edelstenne. Serge Dassault was appointed honorary chairman.\n\nThe American company Atlantic Aviation based in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], was acquired in October 2000.\n[[File:Rafale - RIAT 2017 (35925074454).jpg|thumb|The [[Dassault Rafale]] ordered in 1988 and now in service with the [[French Navy]] and [[French Air Force]].]]\n\nOn 18 December 2000, Dassault Aviation was the first French company to be certified ISO 9001/2000 by BVQI.\n\nWithin fifteen years or so, thanks to developments in I.T., the industrial design offices went from using drawing boards to computerized 3D-modelling. Physical models were replaced by virtual digital mock-ups enabling a first version to be produced that is directly operational. This veritable industrial revolution was made possible thanks to PLM software (Product Lifecycle Management) from [[Dassault Systemes]].\n\n\"Virtual plateau\" technology, allowing all the design offices to work together simultaneously within short deadlines, was deployed for the Falcon 7X trijet program. In this way, for the first time, the primary parts and physical assembly of the first Falcon 7X were produced and carried out at Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac without the slightest adjustment or correction.\n\nAirbus sold some of its ownership back to Dassault in 2014,<ref>Trautvetter, Chad. \"[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2014-12-02/airbus-begins-selling-stake-dassault-aviation Airbus Begins Selling Off Stake in Dassault Aviation]\" ''AINonline'', 2 December 2014.</ref> and further reduced its share to 27% in 2015<ref>{{citation |first=Dan |last= Thisdell |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-raises-stakes-in-move-to-divest-dassault-410551/ |title=Airbus raises stakes in move to divest Dassault |work=[[Flightglobal]] |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=25 March 2015 |accessdate=27 March 2015 }}</ref> then to 10% in 2016.<ref>Dassault Aviation \"[https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/group/finance/shareholding/ Dassault Aviation shareholding]\" ''Dassault Aviation'', 31 December 2016.</ref>\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n'''Sogitec''', a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of Dassault, makes advanced [[avionics]] simulation, [[3D imaging]], military [[flight simulator]]s, and [[document imaging]] systems.\n\n==Shareholders==\nThe Dassault Aviation Group is an international group that encompasses most of the aviation activities of the [[Dassault Group]]\n* [[Dassault Group]] (62.17%) <ref name=2017FinancialReport>{{cite web|url=https://www.dassault-aviation.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2018/03/Dassault_Aviation_2017_RFA_EN.pdf |title=Dassault Aviation 2017 Annual Financial Report|accessdate=2018-03-08 }}</ref>\n* [[Airbus]] (9.93%)\n* Dassault Aviation (0.46%)\n* Private investors (27.44%)\n\n[[File:Structure simplifi\u00e9e du groupe Dassault Aviation.jpg|center|400px|Organigramme financier du groupe Dassault Aviation]]\n\n== Dassault Aviation Group management ==\n\n=== Chief executive officers ===\n* [[Marcel Dassault]]: 1929-1950\n* Auguste Le R\u00e9v\u00e9rend: 1950-1955\n* Benno-Claude Valli\u00e8res: 1955-1986\n* [[Serge Dassault]]: 1986-2000\n* [[Charles Edelstenne]]: 2000-2013\n* [[\u00c9ric Trappier]]: since January 9, 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dev.aviation-office.com/office-new/aviation-accident-reports/1560504.html|title=Eric Trappier Named New Head of Dassault Aviation |publisher=Aviation Office| accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Management committee ===\nExecutive committee since December 31, 2017:\n* [[\u00c9ric Trappier]], chairman and CEO\n* Lo\u00efk Segalen, chief operating officer\n* Beno\u00eet Berger, executive vice-president, industrial operations, procurement and purchasing\n* Bruno Chevalier, senior executive vice president, military customer support\n* Denis Dass\u00e9, chief financial officer\n* Beno\u00eet Dussaugey, senior executive vice president, international\n* Jean-Marc Gasparini, executive vice president, military programs\n* Didier Gondoin, senior executive vice president, engineering\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lherm, senior executive vice president, industrial operations\n* G\u00e9rald Maria, senior executive vice president, total quality\n* Yves Petit, senior vice-president, human resources\n* Philippe Massot, senior vice president, military sales France\n* Jean Sass, executive vice president, IT, and chief digital officer\n* Olivier Villa, senior executive vice president, civil aircraft\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Petit, senior vice president, Falcon programs\n* Bruno Giorganni, executive committee secretary, senior vice president, public affairs and security\n* St\u00e9phane Fort, senior vice-president, corporate communications\n\n==Products==\n\n===Military===\n\n[[File:Dassault Mirage IVP, France -

The entire area is overseen by the [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority]] (MMRDA), a [[Government of Maharashtra|Maharashtra State Government]] organisation in charge of town planning, development, transportation and housing in the region. \n\nThe MMRDA was formed to address the challenges in planning and development of integrated infrastructure for the metropolitan region. The areas outside Brihan Mumbai ([[Mumbai|Greater Mumbai]]) and [[Navi Mumbai]] have lacked organised development.

Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area 'ethnically homogeneous', nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is 'to destroy, in whole or in part' a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent ([[dolus specialis]]), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the [[ICTY]] has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as \"ethnic cleansing\"' (Krsti\u0107, IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group.

He won the [[International GT Open]] in Pro-Am category in [[2018 International GT Open|2018]] and in [[2019 International GT Open|2019]] and the [[24H Series]] in 2015.\n\nIt was announced in April 2014 that he would not be returning to the [[BTCC|British Touring Car Championship]] for 2014 and instead entered the [[2014 British GT season|British GT Championship]] driving in a factory-supported Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3. In 2015, Onslow-Cole won the GT3 class of the 24H Series after taking a podium at every round, including a second place at Dubai 24 Hours and a race win in the inaugural 24 Hours of Paul Ricard. In 2016, he entered various 24H Series events in the Ferrari 488 GT3 and Mercedes AMG GT3, winning the 24 Hours of Brno and taking third at Paul Ricard. He also raced for Team Parker Racing in the Bentley Continental GT3 in the Blancpain Endurance Series Pro-Am class. This year, he has a BMW factory contract for the Nurburgring 24 Hours and will contest Le Mans Cup, GT Open and various 24H Series races in the Mercedes AMG GT3.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Tom Onslow-Cole BMW 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Onslow-Cole at [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] in 2007, the scene of his first [[British Touring Car Championship]] win.]]\n\n===Team RAC (2007)===\nOnslow-Cole began his career in karting at the age of eight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/eveningnews24/norwich-sport/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=xSport&itemid=NOED06%20Aug%202010%2015%3A08%3A29%3A830|title=Tom unimpressed by all the title talk|work=[[Norwich Evening News]]|publisher=[[Archant]]|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> He was the 2006 [[Renault Clio Cup]] champion, winning the title by 113 points from his nearest rival. This allowed him to graduate to the BTCC for the [[2007 British Touring Car Championship season|2007 season]]. He finished 10th overall in the championship standings for [[West Surrey Racing]] after recording four podiums, including his maiden victory at [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]].\n\n===VX Racing (2008)===\nIn [[2008 British Touring Car Championship season|2008]], Vauxhall acquired his services and placed him into the third Vectra along with previous champions of the series, [[Fabrizio Giovanardi]] ([[2007 British Touring Car Championship season|2007]]) and [[Matt Neal]] ([[2005 British Touring Car Championship season|2005]] & [[2006 British Touring Car Championship season|2006]]). He took pole position for round 3 at [[Donington Park]], leading race 1 until dropping to third through an off-track excursion. He was also strong in race 3, before being hit by Giovanardi, but recovered to finish third. He recorded another pole at Thruxton and followed this up with his first two wins of the season in races 1 and 2.

{"title_page": "Paul Bujor", "text_new": "'''Paul Bujor''' (born '''Pavel Bujor''';<ref name=\"m&m43\">M\u0103rghitan & Manca\u0219, p. 43</ref> August 2, 1862 \u2013 May 17, 1952) was a [[Romania]]n zoologist, physiologist and [[marine biologist]], also noted as a socialist writer and politician. Hailing from rural [[Covurlui County]], he studied biology in France and Switzerland, where he was attracted by left-wing ideas; his [[evolutionary biology]], informed by the work of [[Karl Vogt]], veered into [[Marxism]] and [[irreligion]]. Returning to the [[Kingdom of Romania]], he was a junior member of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]], active on its moderate wing. He earned the critics' attention in the 1890s as a short story writer with a socialist and pacifist message, but only returned to fiction writing briefly, in the 1930s. An award-winning [[ichthyologist]], Bujor was hired by the [[University of Ia\u0219i]], where he taught for 41 years, and throughout the period worked on documenting the [[Black Sea]] fauna, and made discoveries concerning the environment of [[Techirghiol Lake]]. He inaugurated the Romanian study of [[animal morphology]], while also contributing to [[histology]], [[embryology]], and [[parasitology]], and gave popular lectures on evolution and [[physical culture]].\n\nBujor rallied with the [[Poporanist]] movement, infiltrating the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] from the left. He was among the founders of the leading Poporanist review, ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', but expelled after expressing disagreement with its refusal to criticize the National Liberal mainstream. As an independent left-winger, constantly pushing for [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[universal suffrage]], Bujor had publicized and sometimes violent conflicts with his far-right colleague at university, [[A. C. Cuza]]. Elected to [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] as a university representative, and serving throughout the [[Romania in World War I|social upheaval of World War I]], Bujor clashed with the National Liberal [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]], whom he accused of bringing disaster upon the country. In 1919, he was one of the founders and leaders of [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], which became part of a successful electoral coalition, representing groups throughout [[Greater Romania]]; Bujor was selected as Greater Romania's first [[President of the Senate of Romania|president of the Senate]].\n\nThe Peasantist attempts at constitutional reform, and Bujor's own signs of approval for far-left concepts, eventually led to a backlash in 1920. Deposed by [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] in 1920, Bujor expressed hopes for a revolution against \"the oligarchy\", but he was gradually marginalized. After 1926, with disciple [[Ioan Borcea]], he represented the dissident left within the consolidated [[National Peasants' Party]], openly criticizing his party's leadership while serving as representative in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]]. Bujor, still a rival of Cuza, professed [[anti-fascism]] throughout the 1930s, but withdrew from the public eye during World War II. He returned to prominence under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], when, at age 86, he was inducted into the [[Romanian Academy]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins and education===\nBujor was born in [[Bere\u0219ti]], [[Covurlui County]] (now [[Gala\u021bi County]]), on August 2 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]: July 20), 1862.<ref name=\"m&m43\"/> Some sources suggest that his father Gavril was a modest farmer or laborer,<ref name=\"sasu\">Livia Gr\u0103mad\u0103, \"Bujor Paul\", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne'', Vol. I, pp. 231\u2013232.

He would later recall that Caragiale was impressed by the \"socialist education\" of German proletarians.<ref name=\"cs\u0103t4\"/> However, it is known that Caragiale mocked Bujor in at least one letter he sent to [[Mihail Dragomirescu]].<ref>[[\u0218erban Cioculescu]], \"Din coresponden\u021ba inedit\u0103 a lui Caragiale cu Mihail Dragomirescu\", in ''[[Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale]]'', Nr. 7/1946, p. 675</ref>\n\nHaving done independent research in [[marine biology]] at [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]],<ref name=\"m&m44\u20135\">M\u0103rghitan & Manca\u0219, pp. 44\u201345</ref> Bujor moved to Geneva for specialized courses in animal morphology, under the guidance of [[Karl Vogt]]. He had been impressed by Vogt's work and [[Transmutation of species|transformist]] outlook, and was enthusiastic about taking courses under [[Ernst Haeckel]]; but he also found life in Paris hardly affordable.<ref name=\"m&m44\"/> Bujor was well-liked by Vogt, who made him part of his research team, and then also worked under Professor Wiederschein at the [[University of Fribourg]]; with [[Grigore Antipa]], he began work on a vast project to study the [[Black Sea]] fauna, stocking up on specialized instruments.<ref name=\"m&m44\u20135\"/> He also continued his engagement with socialism, and attended lectures by [[Georgi Plekhanov]].<ref name=\"sasu\"/><ref name=\"gc565\"/> He received a doctorate in natural sciences from the [[University of Geneva]] in 1891; the work described the larval stages of development in the [[brook lamprey]]. It was one of the first Romanian contributions to dynamic morphology,<ref>Necrasov, p. 354</ref> and also won Bujor the [[Rousseau Institute]]'s Davey Prize.<ref name=\"m&m45\">M\u0103rghitan & Manca\u0219, p. 45</ref>\n\n===PSDMR===\nUpon his return, Bujor had a stint on the University of Bucharest teaching staff, and was an assistant in the physiology laboratory, under [[Alexandru M.

He was dissuaded from this by the Marxist philosopher [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], who noted that he could do much more as an academic.<ref name=\"m&m45\"/> This was also the time of Bujor's literary debut, which was also overseen by Dobrogeanu-Gherea\u2014in the 1930s, Bujor described himself as one of the writers \"belonging to the generation and literary school shaped by Gherea.\"<ref name=\"cs\u0103t4\"/>\n\nAlthough sometimes credited as a writer of the ''[[Contemporanul]]'' circle, Bujor was never actually part of that team, although he may have been in contact with it.<ref>Han\u021b\u0103, p. 581</ref> Instead, by 1894, he was a noted contributor to [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]]'s ''[[Evenimentul|Evenimentul Literar]]'' of Ia\u0219i,<ref>Cornelia \u0218tef\u0103nescu, \"''Evenimentul Literar'' (1893\u20141894)\", in [[\u0218erban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne.

He debated the issue with the [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], his old friend Br\u0103tianu, who responded that the proposed social reforms were inopportune.<ref>Iosa, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> In 1916, Romania, under Br\u0103tianu's PNL government, [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entered the war]] against the Central Powers; by 1917, its territory had been invaded, with only [[Western Moldavia]] still under control. The cabinet and both chambers of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] relocated to Ia\u0219i. By April\u2013May 1917, senator Bujor was an ally of the opposition [[Labor Party (Romania)|Labor Party]] and of breakaway [[Conservative-Democratic Party|Conservative Democrats]], calling for more progressive policies than the National Liberals offered. During those months, he joined a parliamentary commission on land reform\u2014although, as PNL man [[Ion G.

Bujor emerged from the Laborer Party (''Partidul Muncitor''), which he helped establish, from the remnants of Labor Party chapters, in November 1918\u2014just as [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the world war was ending]].

Both proposals were ignored, and parliament only debated a more conservative project, advanced by Averescu's [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture Minister]], [[Constantin Garoflid]]; this incensed the FDNS to address the peasants directly, with leaflets condemning the lawmaking-landowners.<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), pp. 207\u2013208</ref> Alongside Iorga, Bujor also proposed the [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]] of underground resources, against Garoflid, who wanted the subsoil placed under a mixed property regime.<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), p. 208</ref> As the Democratic Nationalists split, with Cuza backing Averescu, Bujor openly celebrated Iorga as the more progressive nationalist, one \"in the spirit of the times\".<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), p. 210</ref>\n\nDuring 1921, Bujor joined a parliamentary board of inquiry into the Romanian administration of [[Bessarabia]], presided upon by [[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria]].

Hailing from rural [[Covurlui County]], he studied biology in France and Switzerland, where he was attracted by left-wing ideas; his [[evolutionary biology]], informed by the work of [[Karl Vogt]], veered into [[Marxism]] and [[irreligion]]. Returning to the [[Kingdom of Romania]], he was a junior member of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]], active on its moderate wing. He earned the critics' attention in the 1890s as a short story writer with a socialist and pacifist message, but only returned to fiction writing briefly, in the 1930s. An award-winning [[ichthyologist]], Bujor was hired by the [[University of Ia\u0219i]], where he taught for 41 years, and throughout the period worked on documenting the [[Black Sea]] fauna, and made discoveries concerning the environment of [[Techirghiol Lake]]. He inaugurated the Romanian study of [[animal morphology]], while also contributing to [[histology]], [[embryology]], and [[parasitology]], and gave popular lectures on evolution and [[physical culture]].\n\nBujor rallied with the [[Poporanist]] movement, infiltrating the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] from the left. He was among the founders of the leading Poporanist review, ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', but expelled after expressing disagreement with its refusal to criticize the National Liberal mainstream. As an independent left-winger, constantly pushing for [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[universal suffrage]], Bujor had publicized and sometimes violent conflicts with his far-right colleague at university, [[A. C. Cuza]]. Elected to [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] as a university representative, and serving throughout the [[Romania in World War I|social upheaval of World War I]], Bujor clashed with the National Liberal [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]], whom he accused of bringing disaster upon the country. In 1919, he was one of the founders and leaders of [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], which became part of a successful electoral coalition, representing groups throughout [[Greater Romania]]; Bujor was selected as Greater Romania's first [[President of the Senate of Romania|president of the Senate]].\n\nThe Peasantist attempts at constitutional reform, and Bujor's own signs of approval for far-left concepts, eventually led to a backlash in 1920. Deposed by [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] in 1920, Bujor expressed hopes for a revolution against \"the oligarchy\", but he was gradually marginalized. After 1926, with disciple [[Ioan Borcea]], he represented the dissident left within the consolidated [[National Peasants' Party]], openly criticizing his party's leadership while serving as representative in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]]. Bujor, still a rival of Cuza, professed [[anti-fascism]] throughout the 1930s, but withdrew from the public eye during World War II. He returned to prominence under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], when, at age 86, he was inducted into the [[Romanian Academy]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins and education===\nBujor was born in [[Bere\u0219ti]], [[Covurlui County]] (now [[Gala\u021bi County]]), on August 2 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]: July 20), 1862.<ref name=\"m&m43\"/> Some sources suggest that his father Gavril was a modest farmer or laborer,<ref name=\"sasu\">Livia Gr\u0103mad\u0103, \"Bujor Paul\", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne'', Vol. I, pp. 231\u2013232.

He debated the issue with the [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], his old friend Br\u0103tianu, who responded that the proposed social reforms were inopportune.<ref>Iosa, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> In 1916, Romania, under Br\u0103tianu's PNL government, [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entered the war]] against the Central Powers; by 1917, its territory had been invaded, with only [[Western Moldavia]] still under control. The cabinet and both chambers of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] relocated to Ia\u0219i. By April\u2013May 1917, senator Bujor was an ally of the opposition [[Labor Party (Romania)|Labor Party]] and of breakaway [[Conservative-Democratic Party|Conservative Democrats]], calling for more progressive policies than the National Liberals offered. During those months, he joined a parliamentary commission on land reform\u2014although, as PNL man [[Ion G. Duca]] notes, these were dominated \"by the great landowners, since Br\u0103tianu's goal was to get those most affected by the reforms to support them as well.\"<ref>Duca, p. 189</ref> On May 30, he signed up to a list of demands formulated by the Conservative Democrat dissidents [[Ion C.

Bujor emerged from the Laborer Party (''Partidul Muncitor''), which he helped establish, from the remnants of Labor Party chapters, in November 1918\u2014just as [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the world war was ending]].

As noted at the time by sociologist [[Dimitrie Dr\u0103ghicescu]], he was one of many former National Liberals in the P\u021a, confirming claims that the Peasantists were only the \"impatiently democratic\" side of the PNL mainstream.<ref>Dr\u0103ghicescu, pp. 94\u201395</ref> The Bujor faction immediately claimed a degree of autonomy inside the larger movement, forming tactical alliances with parties that the P\u021a as a whole disavowed.<ref>Murgescu ''et al.'', p. 303</ref>\n\nIn the [[1919 Romanian general election|election of November 1919]], which tested [[universal male suffrage]] and brought a relative victory for the [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR), Bujor returned as senator for his university. He also ran on the P\u021a list for the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] in Ia\u0219i, and won, but renounced his seat in favor the senatorial mandate; Neculai Cost\u0103chescu also renounced, and the seat ultimately went to Gheorghe Ciobanu.<ref>Murgescu ''et al.'', pp. 305, 396</ref> Bujor regarded this moment as a great victory for his cause, publishing a thank-you note to his voters, congratulating them for thus \"ridding the country of its internal enemy\".<ref>Murgescu ''et al.'', p. 306</ref> He accompanied party leader [[Ion Mihalache]] during talks with the PNR and other parties, establishing a solidified government coalition. These discussions also involved [[Iuliu Maniu]] of the PNR, [[Ion Incule\u021b]] of the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]], and both Cuza and Iorga as rival leaders of the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND).<ref>Iorga (1930), pp. 271, 273, 280.

Bujor advocated a d\u00e9tente \"between us and our neighbors\", and insisted that [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanian Ukrainians]] would not be forgotten for that.<ref>Radu Filipescu, \"Rom\u00e2nii transnistreni \u00een dezbaterile Parlamentului Rom\u00e2niei (1919\u20131937)\", in ''Acta Moldaviae Septentrionalis'', Vol. X, 2011, p. 221</ref> Overall, Bujor endured as a \"timidly democratic socialist\" (according to C\u0103linescu),<ref>C\u0103linescu, p. 565; M\u0103rghitan & Manca\u0219, p. 47</ref> a \"progressive idealist\" (according to the communist [[Petre Constantinescu-Ia\u0219i]]),<ref>[[Petre Constantinescu-Ia\u0219i]], ''Pagini de lupt\u0103 din trecut'', p. 151.

Reportedly, they convinced Averescu to accept a reform of the 1866 constitution; in the end, Averescu withdrew from the talks, and embarked on a rapprochement with the PNL.<ref>Iorga (1930), pp. 286\u2013292</ref> During those weeks, in his many meetings with King Ferdinand, Bujor declared himself a constitutionalist, which the king reportedly found a constructive approach; to Iorga, he stated his intention to work \"for democracy\".<ref>Iorga (1930), pp. 283, 286, 341\u2013342</ref> He was despondent when Vaida would not assign [[Prefect (Romania)|prefectures]] to P\u021a men, declaring that the opportunity for a regime change had been lost.<ref>Iorga (1930), pp. 298\u2013299</ref> Renewing his support for land reform, Bujor was again a noted critic of the antisemitic Cuza, whom he accused of wanting to destroy the university with his mystical rhetoric and his violent actions.<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1979), pp. 368, 369\u2013370, 371</ref> He was also reportedly upset that Cuza was the government's key man in Ia\u0219i.<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 303</ref>\n\n===1920 marginalization===\nDuring the early months of 1920, Bujor reverted to a more uncompromising stance, voting to put pressure on the king and thus force into law Mihalache's land reform proposal. On March 12\u201313, the king informed him and Iorga that he expected Democratic Bloc ministers to resign, with Bujor protesting, in vain, that the regime being revoked was \"good for the country\".<ref>Iorga (1930), pp. 355\u2013356, 360\u2013365.

Other leading members were Vaida, Maniu, Mihalache, [[Nicolae L. Lupu]], [[Ion Nistor]], [[Virgil Madgearu]], and [[Ion Incule\u021b]].<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), pp. 206, 208</ref> As Iorga notes, during the banquet marking this alliance, Bujor perplexed those in the audience by again mentioning his revolutionary credentials and, obliquely, his [[proletarian internationalism]].<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 371</ref>\n\nDuring July, Bujor in the Senate and Mihalache in the Assembly reintroduced for debate their radical version of land reform. Both proposals were ignored, and parliament only debated a more conservative project, advanced by Averescu's [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture Minister]], [[Constantin Garoflid]]; this incensed the FDNS to address the peasants directly, with leaflets condemning the lawmaking-landowners.<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), pp. 207\u2013208</ref> Alongside Iorga, Bujor also proposed the [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]] of underground resources, against Garoflid, who wanted the subsoil placed under a mixed property regime.<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), p. 208</ref> As the Democratic Nationalists split, with Cuza backing Averescu, Bujor openly celebrated Iorga as the more progressive nationalist, one \"in the spirit of the times\".<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1981), p. 210</ref>\n\nDuring 1921, Bujor joined a parliamentary board of inquiry into the Romanian administration of [[Bessarabia]], presided upon by [[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria]]. Alongside [[Vasile S\u0103car\u0103]] and others, he inspected [[Cahul County (Romania)|Cahul County]], where he recorded various cases of official misconduct, including theft of property and beatings.<ref>[[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria|Ba\u021baria Nicolae]], ''Raportul comisiunii parlamentare asupra anchetei f\u0103cut\u0103 \u00een Basarabia''. Bucharest: Imprimeria Statului, 1921</ref> During the constitutional debates, he supported the (ultimately defeated) [[women's suffrage]] motion presented by [[George Meitani]], arguing that the graduation of women into politics was \"a necessity imposed on us by the social conditions\". Women, he noted, had proven themselves competent workers and managers during the war years.<ref>Georgeta Tudoran, \"Din lupta socialist\u0103 pentru afirmarea politic\u0103 a femeii \u00een anii premerg\u0103tori f\u0103uririi Partidului Comunist Rom\u00e2n (III)\", in ''Revista de Istorie'', Nr. 5/1987, p. 510</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1922 Romanian general election|1922 elections]], with Br\u0103tianu again returning in power, Bujor declared an all-out fight with the \"oligarchy\" for the \"holy rights of liberty and justice.\" He optimistically argued that the \"three-headed dragon\" would be defeated by the \"fire-sword archangel\" of democracy, claiming that the fall of the Vaida cabinet was just a symptom of the PNL's losing struggle.<ref>Al.

Bujor dismissed this, arguing that Iamandi and his National Liberals were picking up on any detail that might help them silence the opposition.<ref name=\"rf71\"/> However, following the establishment and immediate repression of the [[Romanian Communist Party]], Bujor appeared as a defense witness in the [[Dealul Spirii Trial]], where he spoke favorably of communists such as [[Timotei Marin]].<ref>Gh.

In his editorial for ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'' in March 1923, he declared the PNL to be a party of the far-right, penetrated not just by oligarchy, but also by the \"obscurantism\" of extremist movements. He also accused the formerly progressive Br\u0103tianu of \"cowardice\" for having gone back on promises for [[proportional representation]].<ref name=\"pjrev1\"/> With the Bessarabian [[Vasile Stroescu]], and with many other activists and socialists, he founded in August the League for Human Rights.<ref>Petrescu, pp. 382\u2013386</ref> In October 1924, speaking both in parliament and at university, Bujor condemned Cuza's disciple, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], for the assassination of [[Constantin Manciu]]\u2014described by him as an \"odious\" deed, one ultimately inspired by Cuza and the [[National-Christian Defense League]].<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1979), p. 371</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nIn the [[1926 Romanian general election|June 1926 election]], Bujor won an Assembly seat for [[Ia\u0219i County]], as one of two deputies not affiliated with the People's Party; the other was Cuza for the Defense League.<ref>\"Noua camer\u0103\", in ''Rom\u00e2nia Nou\u0103'', June 9, 1926, p. 2; \"Numele \u0219i nuan\u021ba politic\u0103 a noilor deputa\u021bi\", in ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', June 5, 1926, p. 4</ref> Eventually, Bujor followed the Peasantists into merger with the PNR, thus joining the consolidated [[National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021a). He was head of its Ia\u0219i chapter until June 1928, when he resigned without renouncing his membership. Responding to rumors that he was going to rejoin the PNL, Bujor announced that the only two parties he supported were the PN\u021a and the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927\u201348)|Social Democrats]].<ref>\"Atitudinea politic\u0103 a d-lui Paul Bujor\", in ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', June 27, 1928, p. 3</ref>\n\nAlthough the PN\u021a carried the [[1928 Romanian general election|elections of December 1928]], both Bujor and Borcea remained on the group's far-left, criticizing perceived fascist tendencies on the right, and were, overall, largely inactive members.<ref>Agrigoroaiei (1979), pp. 367, 368\u2013369</ref> Such internal opposition was expressed in October 1930, when Bujor wrote another ''Adev\u0103rul'' editorial asking for the inclusion of Social Democratic ministers. He also denounced the PN\u021a \"oligarchy\", portraying [[Iuliu Maniu]] as a dictator and exposing Vaida as a \"reactionary antisemite\", guilty of having \"[[Lupeni strike of 1929|massacred innocent workers at Lupeni]]\".<ref>Paul Bujor, \"Discu\u021bii: ...Atunci ce-i de f\u0103cut?\", in ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'', October 7, 1930, pp. 1\u20132</ref> In parallel interviews for ''Adev\u0103rul'', he and the former socialist Atanasiu were debating whether the PSDMR had any chance of surviving the 1898 split: while Bujor suggested that it did, Atanasiu insisted that Romania was not ripe for socialism.<ref name=\"icatrec5\"/> Bujor's other political involvement was with the Action Committee of the League Against War, where he was colleagues with another Ia\u0219i academic, [[Iorgu Iordan]].<ref>\"Adesiuni la Liga impotriva r\u0103sboiului\", in ''Vrerea'', Nr. 14\u201319/1932, p. 2</ref>\n\nAmong his last academic assignments was touring Greater Romania on an examination commission, testing the Romanian-language aptitudes of the teaching staff inherited from [[Austria-Hungary]].

{"title_page": "International auxiliary language", "text_new": "{{short description|Language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language}}\nAn '''international auxiliary language'''{{efn-ua| The term was used at least as early as 1908, by [[Otto Jespersen]]. }} (sometimes abbreviated as '''IAL''' or '''auxlang''') is a [[language]] meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common [[first language]]. An auxiliary language is primarily a [[foreign language]]. It usually takes words from widely spoken languages.\n\nLanguages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as [[lingua francas]] that have sometimes approached the international level. [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] were used in the past, and [[Modern Standard Arabic|(Standard) Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.<ref name=\"bodmer_pei\">Bodmer, Frederick. ''The loom of language'' and Pei, Mario. ''One language for the world.''</ref>\n\nHowever, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance\u2014cultural, political, and economic\u2014that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting an artificial or [[constructed language]] as a possible solution, by way of \"auxiliary\" language.<ref name=\"bodmer_pei\"/> The term \"auxiliary\" implies that it is intended to be an additional language for the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed specifically to ease international communication, such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and [[Interlingua]]. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., [[International English]]), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a [[universal language]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a \"working language\", \"bridge language\", \"vehicular language\" or \"unifying language\") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues,<ref>Viacheslav A. Chirikba, \"The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund\" in Pieter Muysken, ed., ''From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics'', 2008, p. 31. {{ISBN|90-272-3100-1}}</ref> may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (or [[Koine Greek]]) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterraneum; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and then [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], remained the common languages of a large part of [[Western Asia]] through several earlier empires.<ref>Ostler, 2005 pp. 38\u201340</ref> Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called ''lingua francas''.\n\n===Natural international languages: Lingua francas===\n''[[Lingua franca]]s'' have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called \"trade languages\") but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], a [[pidgin]] language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is [[English language|English]]. Moreover, a special case of [[English language|English]] is that of [[Basic English]], a simplified version of [[English language|English]] which shares the same grammar (though simplified) and a reduced vocabulary of only 1,000 words, with the intention that anyone with a basic knowledge of [[English language|English]] should be able to understand even quite complex texts. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/best-languages-influence-world/ | title=Languages that Influence the World }}</ref>\n\n===Constructed languages===\n{{main|Constructed language}}\nSince all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar which makes them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue,{{citation needed|date=April 2015|reason=Both assertions in this sentence need to be sourced to a reliable source.}} attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of the 18th century, where [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]], in the article on ''Langue'', wrote a short proposition of a \"laconic\" or regularized grammar of French.\n\nSome of the [[philosophical language]]s of the 17th\u201318th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; [[Solresol]] by [[Fran\u00e7ois Sudre]], a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.\n\n====Volap\u00fck====\n{{main|Volap\u00fck}}\nDuring the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so [[Louis Couturat]] and [[L\u00e9opold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.\n\n[[Volap\u00fck]], first described in an article in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]] and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volap\u00fck conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volap\u00fck as its working language. Andr\u00e9 Cherpillod writes of the third Volap\u00fck convention,{{quote|In August 1889 the third convention was held in Paris. About two hundred people from many countries attended. And, unlike in the first two conventions, people spoke only Volap\u00fck. For the first time in the history of mankind, sixteen years before [[World Congress of Esperanto|the Boulogne convention]], an international convention spoke an international language.<ref name=\"cherpillod1995\">Foreword to ''Konciza Gramatiko de Volapuko'', Andr\u00e9 Cherpillod. Courgenard, 1995.</ref>}}\nHowever, not long after, the Volap\u00fck speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volap\u00fck speakers, and the appearance of newer, [[second-language acquisition|easier-to-learn]] [[constructed language]]s, primarily [[History of Esperanto|Esperanto]].\n\n====From ''Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka'' to ''Academia pro Interlingua''====\n\nAnswering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volap\u00fckists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name [[International Volap\u00fck Academy]] (''Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka'') at the second Volap\u00fck congress in [[Munich]] in August 1887.<ref>Schmidt, Johann. 1964. ''Jenotem valemap\u00fcka Volap\u00fck''. Amsterdam: Volap\u00fckagased.</ref><ref>Schmidt, Johann. 1996. ''Historio de la universala lingvo Volapuko''. Translator: Philippe Combot. Courgenard: La Blancheti\u00e8re. {{ISBN|2-906134-30-9}}</ref> The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language [[Volap\u00fck]], but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volap\u00fckists and those who wanted to reform Volap\u00fck to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major [[world language]]s. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volap\u00fck Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.\n\nUnder [[Waldemar Rosenberger]], who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \"[[Idiom Neutral]]\". The name of the Academy was changed to ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.\n\nIn 1903, the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano]] published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], instead of inventing schematic structures and ''a priori'' language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, [[Latin]]. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named ''Interlingua'' by Peano but is usually referred to as \"[[Latino sine flexione]]\".\n\nImpressed by Peano's Interlingua, the ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to ''[[Academia pro Interlingua]]'' (where ''Interlingua'' stands for Peano's language). The ''Academia pro Interlingua'' survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's Interlingua that inspired the better-known [[Interlingua]] presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\n\n====Esperanto====\n{{main|History of Esperanto}}\n\nAfter the emergence of Volap\u00fck, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s\u20131900s, but none except [[Esperanto]] gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873\u20131887 (a [[Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|first version]] was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], as a primarily schematic language; the word-stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of [[Esperanto vocabulary|derivational word formation]] which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time.{{citation needed| date= September 2017}} From early on, Esperantists created their [[Esperanto culture|own culture]] which helped to form the [[Esperantujo|Esperanto language community]].\n\nWithin a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become \"the most outlandishly successful invented language ever\" and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language.<ref>{{citation\n |title       = Discouraging Words\n |magazine    = [[Failure Magazine]]\n |date        = 2009-07-20\n |first       = Jason\n |last        = Zasky\n |quote       = But in terms of invented languages, it\u2019s the most outlandishly successful invented language ever.

Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called [[Esperantido]]s, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.\n\n====Interlingue and Novial====\n{{main|Interlingue}}\n[[Edgar de Wahl]]'s [[Interlingue]] of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Latino sine flexione]], de Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Interlingue gained a small speaker community in the 1920s and 1930s, and supported several publications, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s.<ref name=\"harlow2000\"/> More recently Interlingue has been revived on the Internet.\n\nIn 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]], abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, [[Novial]].<ref>{{cite web\n |author      = Harlow, Donald J\n |authorlink  = Don Harlow\n |url         = http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#novial\n |title       = Novial\n |work        = How to Build a Language\n |date        = 4 July 2006\n |accessdate  = 12 February 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044938/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#novial\n |archivedate = 4 February 2012\n}}</ref> It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Interlingue, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but soon both Novial and Interlingue were abandoned in favour of [[Interlingua]], the first auxiliary language based fully on scientific methodology.\n\n====Interlingua====\n{{main|History of Interlingua}}\nThe [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA) was founded in 1924 by [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]]; like the earlier ''Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language'', its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. [[History of Interlingua|Interlingua]], published in 1951, was primarily the work of [[Alexander Gode]], though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]], and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, de Walhl's Interlingue, and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Interlingue, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Interlingue, though still less than in any natural language.\n\nThe theory underlying Interlingua posits an ''international vocabulary'', a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to \"all corners of the world\". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred.<ref>Words appearing in only a few, closely related languages were ignored. See Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.</ref> They conducted studies to identify \"the most generally international vocabulary possible\", while still maintaining the unity of the language.<ref>Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company (p. xxii).</ref> This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called ''control languages'') resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.\n\nInterlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely ''understood'' international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.<ref name=\"blandino1989\">Blandino, Giovanni, \"Le problema del linguas international auxiliari\", ''Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia'', Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.</ref> Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.<ref>\"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua,\" ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.</ref>\n\nAfter the creation of Interlingua, there were no more successful attempts in international language engineering that would attract a significant number of supporters, thus the enthusiasm about constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960\u20131990.\n\n===Internet age===\nAll of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html CONLANG mailing list] was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in [[artistic language]]s and [[engineered language]]s grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/auxlang.html AUXLANG mailing list] was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then.  Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including [[Kotava]], [[Lingua Franca Nova]], [[Lingwa de planeta]], [[Pandunia]], and [[Sambahsa]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Libert|first=Alan Reed|date=2018-06-25|title=Artificial Languages|url=http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11}}</ref>\n\n===Zonal constructed languages===\n{{main|Zonal constructed language}}\n\nNot every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of a certain group of related languages. The oldest known example is a [[Pan-Slavic language]] written in 1665 by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107]]. He named this language [[Interslavic language#Early projects|Ruski]] (\"Russian\"), but in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], his own [[Southern Chakavian]] dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]], and, to a lesser degree, [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=\u0418\u0417 \u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u0418 \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0420\u041b\u0418\u041d\u0413\u0412\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418 \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0418|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nMost zonal constructed languages were created during the period of [[romantic nationalism]] at the end of the 19th century; some were created later.

Most notable among modern examples is [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]], a project established in 2011 after the merger of several other projects.

''International Language and Science: Considerations on the Introduction of an International Language into Science.'' 1910.</ref> described the controversy in the preface to their book ''International Language and Science'':\n\n:The question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past [[Volap\u00fck]] period, and is still in the present [[Esperanto]] movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910, p. v). <!-- this seems like an inept translation of the original text, but I don't have the original text available to do a better xltn -->\n\n[[Leopold Pfaundler]] wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:\n\n:All who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.\n\nFor Couturat et al., Volap\u00fckists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.\n\nSome contemporaries of Couturat, notably [[Edward Sapir]]<ref>Sapir, Edward (1931). \"The function of an international auxiliary language\". Romanic Review (11): 4\u201315.</ref><ref>Sapir, Edward (1925). \"Memorandum on the problem of an international auxiliary language\". The Romanic Review (16): 244\u2013256</ref> saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century,<ref>Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 2015.

Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.\n\nSome consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an [[ISO 646]] letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO 646:\n* /\u0283/ (U+0283, IPA 134)\n* /\u0292/ (U+0292, IPA 135)\n* /\u0261/ (U+0261, IPA 110, single storey g) = g (U+0067, double storey g)\nFour are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:\n* /t\u0361s/ = /ts/\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ = /t\u0283/; Note: Polish distinguishes between them\n* /d\u0361z/ = /dz/\n* /d\u0361\u0292/ = /d\u0292/\n\nThat means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO 646, also have no common alternative in ISO 646: \u0283, \u0292.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Translated by Humphrey Tonkin et al.  State University of New York Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-7914-1254-7}}.</ref>\n\n* [[A priori (languages)|''A priori'' languages]] are characterized by largely artificial [[morpheme]]s (not borrowed from natural languages), schematic [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], simple [[phonology]], [[grammar]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Some ''a priori'' languages are called [[philosophical language]]s, referring to their basis in philosophical ideas about thought and language. These include some of the earliest efforts at auxiliary language in the 17th century. Some more specific subcategories:\n** Taxonomic languages form their words using a taxonomic hierarchy, with each phoneme of a word helping specify its position in a semantic hierarchy of some kind; for example, [[Solresol]].\n** [[Pasigraphy|Pasigraphies]] are purely written languages without a spoken form, or with a spoken form left at the discretion of the reader; many of the 17th\u201318th century philosophical languages and auxlangs were pasigraphies.  This set historically tends to overlap with taxonomic languages, though there is no inherent reason a pasigraphy needs to be taxonomic.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n** [[Logical language]]s such as [[Lojban]] and its predecessor, [[Loglan]], aim to eliminate ambiguity. Both these examples derive their morphemes from a broad range of natural languages using statistical methods.\n* ''A posteriori'' languages are based on existing natural languages.

Although ''a posteriori'' languages have been based on most of the families of European languages, the most successful of these (notably [[Esperanto]],<ref>http://failuremag.com/feature/article/discouraging_words/</ref> Ido and [[Interlingua]]) have been based largely on Romance elements.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n** Schematic (or \"mixed\") languages have some ''a priori'' qualities.  Some have ethnic [[morpheme]]s but alter them significantly to fit a simplified [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] pattern (e.g., [[Volap\u00fck]]) or both artificial and natural [[morpheme]]s (e.g., [[Perio]]). Partly schematic languages have partly schematic and partly naturalistic derivation (e.g. [[Esperanto]] and Ido). Natural [[morpheme]]s of languages in this group are rarely altered greatly from their source-language form, but compound and derived words are generally not recognizable at sight by people familiar with the source languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n** Naturalistic languages resemble existing natural languages. For example, [[Interlingue]], [[Interlingua]], and [[Lingua Franca Nova]] were developed so that not only the root words but their compounds and derivations will often be recognizable immediately by large numbers of people. Some naturalistic languages do have a limited number of artificial morphemes or invented grammatical devices (e.g. [[Novial]]). (the term \"naturalistic\" as used in auxlang does not mean the same thing as the homophonous term used in describing [[artistic language]]s.<ref>[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&L=CONLANG&D=0&T=0&P=5208 \"Re: \"Naturalistic\" for auxlangers vs artlangers?\"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by J\u00f6rg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009</ref>{{Better source|date=January 2013}})\n** Simplified natural languages reduce the full extent of vocabulary and partially regularize the grammar of a natural language (e.g. [[Basic English]] and [[Special English]].\n\n===Comparison of sample texts===\n\nSome examples of the best known international auxiliary languages are shown below for comparative purposes.

not so much which, but how.<ref>Mario Pei, ''One language for the world'' (1958)</ref> Several approaches exist toward the eventual full expansion and consolidation of an international auxiliary language.\n# Laissez-faire. This approach is taken in the belief that one language will eventually and inevitably \"win out\" as a world auxiliary language (e.g. International English) without any need for specific action.\n# Institutional sponsorship and grass-roots promotion of language programs. This approach has taken various forms, depending on the language and language type, ranging from government promotion of a particular language to one-on-one encouragement to learn the language to instructional or marketing programs.\n# National legislation. This approach seeks to have individual countries (or even localities) progressively endorse a given language as an official language (or to promote the concept of international legislation).\n# International legislation. This approach involves promotion of the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps to be under the auspices of such international organizations as the [[United Nations]] or [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]) to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the [[Baha'i Faith]], seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official [[world language]], to be used in addition to local languages.<ref>See an edited compilation of excerpts from the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings regarding the principle of International or Universal Auxiliary Language: The Greatest Instrument for Promoting Harmony and Civilization: Excerpts from the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Writings and Related Sources on the Question of an International Auxiliary Language. Gregory Paul Meyjes, ed. Oxford: George Ronald. 2015. {{ISBN|978-085398-591-4}}</ref> This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.\n\n==Pictorial languages==\n\nThere have been a number of proposals for using pictures, [[ideograms]], diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original [[Characteristica Universalis]] proposed by the philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], to suggestions for the adoption of [[Chinese writing]], to recent inventions such as [[Blissymbol]].<ref>Charles Keisel Bliss, ''Semantography (Blissymbolics)''</ref>\n\nWithin the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the [[schematics]] used to represent [[circuit diagram|electronic circuits]], [[chemical symbols]], [[mathematical symbols]], and the [[Energy Systems Language]] of [[systems ecology]]. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.\n\n==Sign languages==\n\nAn international auxiliary sign language has been developed by [[deaf]] people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as [[Gestuno]]<ref>Rubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J., ''Gestuno: International sign language of the deaf.''</ref> but now more commonly known simply as '[[International Sign|international sign]]', the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are [[Iconicity|iconic]] and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] was used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].\n\nGestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language [[Signuno]], which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{POV section|date=October 2019}}\nThere has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.\n\nCriticisms directed against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages in the late 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects.<ref name=\"zamenhof1900\">\"Esenco kaj Estonteco de la Ideo de Lingvo Internacia\", L. L. Zamenhof, 1900.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', 1992 [1903].</ref> Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce the diversity of the language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs,<ref name=\"piron1994\"/> or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs.<ref>[http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html \"Farewell to auxiliary languages\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html |date=2012-07-16 }}, by Richard K. Harrison. 1997.</ref>  However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.\n\nOne criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the [[Language death|extinction]] of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs;.<ref name=\"zamenhof1900\"/><ref name=\"oslak2005\">\"\u0108u Zamenhof Pravis?\", Vinko O\u0161lak, ''Fonto'', februaro 2005.</ref> Another response has been that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are often thought to also be proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages{{why|date=May 2013}} and cultures. Based on Baha'i writ, Meyjes (2006) sees an International Auxiliary Language intended to be implemented in ways that shield native tongues from undue pressures from any traditional lingua franca, while enabling inter-community communication worldwide <ref>Also see \"universalization\" in Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 1999.

Hofheim (Ts.): Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Verlag. 129-146</ref>\n\nAlthough referred to as ''international'' languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of [[Western European]] languages.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was common for Volap\u00fck and Esperanto, and to some extent Ido, to be criticized for not being Western European enough; Interlingue and Interlingua were (among other things) responses to this kind of criticism. More recently{{when|date=October 2019}} all these major auxlangs have been criticized for being too European and not global enough.<ref name=\"kupsala2005\">[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&L=AUXLANG&T=0&F=&S=&P=2560 \"Types of neutrality, and central concerns for an IAL\"].  AUXLANG mailing list post by Risto Kupsala, 2 December 2005.</ref>  One response to this criticism has been that doing otherwise in no way makes the language easier for anyone, while drawing away from the sources of much international vocabulary, technical and popular.<ref>Alexander Gode, quoted by Mario Pei in ''One language for the world'' (1958).</ref>  Another response, primarily from Esperanto speakers, is that the internationality of a language has more to do with the culture of its speakers than with its linguistic properties. Esperanto itself uses individual words from Indo-European languages, but its grammar is much more similar to Chinese and Greek, (while being flexible enough in grammar and sentence structure to be able to copy the word-order of Japanese, Indonesian and English all about as well as each other) so it's difficult to judge how much of an Indo-European language it even is.<ref name=\"harlow2006\"/>  The term \"Euroclone\" was coined to refer to these languages in contrast to [[worldlang|\"worldlangs\"]] with global vocabulary sources; the term is sometimes applied only to self-proclaimed \"naturalistic\" auxlangs such as Occidental and Interlingua, sometimes to all auxlangs with primarily European vocabulary sources, regardless of their grammar, including Esperanto and Lingua Franca Nova.\n\nThe response to this argument was made by Alexander Gode<ref>Gode, Alexander, et al. ''Interlingua-English: a dictionary of the international language.'' Storm Publishers, New York, 1951.</ref> and reiterated by Mario Pei:<ref>Pei, Mario. ''One Language for the World.'' N.Y.: Devin-Adair, 1958:</ref> A vocabulary selected from a broad variety of languages does not make the language any easier for speakers of any one language. Gode's example compares a paragraph in Interlingua with a paragraph with words from Chinese, Japanese, Malay, and other non-European languages. The first, he argues, should be understood by those familiar with the Romance languages, and not overly difficult for most English speakers:\n\n:La sol dice: \"io me appella sol. Io es multo brillante. Io me leva al est, e cuando io me leva, il es die. Io reguarda per tu fenestra con mi oculo brillante como le auro, e io te dice quando il es tempore a levar te. E io te dice: 'Pigro, leva te. Io non brilla a fin que tu resta al lecto a dormir, sed que tu lege e que tu te promena.'\"\n\nThe second, in contrast, should not only be difficult for speakers of European languages, but Malay speakers likely will not understand the Chinese words, Chinese speakers will likely not understand the Japanese words, and Japanese speakers likely will not understand the Malay words:\n\n:Mata-hari yu: \"Wo-ti nama mata-hari. Wo taihen brillante. Wo leva wo a est, dan toki wo leva wo, ada hari. Wo miru per ni-ti fenestra sama wo-ti mata brillante como kin, dan wo yu ni toki ada tempo a levar ni. Dan wo yu ni: 'Sust, leva ni. Wo non brilla sam-rap ni tomaru a toko a nemuru, sed wo brilla sam-rap ni leva ni, dan que ni suru kam, ni yomu, dan ni aruku.'\"\n\nAn ''a priori'' vocabulary such as that of [[Spokil]] or [[Kotava]], or a vocabulary constructed mathematically, such as that of [[Loglan]] or [[Lojban]], would likely be as comprehensible.\n\nGode argues, additionally, that the western languages are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, it must be said that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an ''a priori'' one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many proposals for auxlangs based on global sources of vocabulary and grammar have been made, but most (like the majority of the European-based auxlangs of earlier decades) remain sketches too incomplete to be speakable, and of the more complete ones, few have gained any speakers.  More recently there has been a trend, on the AUXLANG mailing list and on the more recently founded [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/worldlanglist/ worldlang mailing list], to greater collaboration between various proponents of a more globally based auxlang.\n\n==See also==\n\nSee '''{{section link|List of constructed languages|Auxiliary languages}}''' for a list of designed international auxiliary languages.\n* [[Interlinguistics]]\n* ''[[International Language Review]]''\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Language planning]]\n* [[Lingua franca]]\n* [[Contemporary Latin#Living Latin|Living Latin]]\n* [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and auxiliary language]]\n* [[Zonal constructed languages]]\n* [[Global language system]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Notelist-ua}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* Bliss, Charles Keisel.

An auxiliary language is primarily a [[foreign language]]. It usually takes words from widely spoken languages.\n\nLanguages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as [[lingua francas]] that have sometimes approached the international level. [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] were used in the past, and [[Modern Standard Arabic|(Standard) Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.<ref name=\"bodmer_pei\">Bodmer, Frederick. ''The loom of language'' and Pei, Mario. ''One language for the world.''</ref>\n\nHowever, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance\u2014cultural, political, and economic\u2014that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting an artificial or [[constructed language]] as a possible solution, by way of \"auxiliary\" language.<ref name=\"bodmer_pei\"/> The term \"auxiliary\" implies that it is intended to be an additional language for the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed specifically to ease international communication, such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and [[Interlingua]]. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., [[International English]]), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a [[universal language]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a \"working language\", \"bridge language\", \"vehicular language\" or \"unifying language\") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues,<ref>Viacheslav A. Chirikba, \"The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund\" in Pieter Muysken, ed., ''From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics'', 2008, p. 31. {{ISBN|90-272-3100-1}}</ref> may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (or [[Koine Greek]]) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterraneum; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and then [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], remained the common languages of a large part of [[Western Asia]] through several earlier empires.<ref>Ostler, 2005 pp. 38\u201340</ref> Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called ''lingua francas''.\n\n===Natural international languages: Lingua francas===\n''[[Lingua franca]]s'' have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called \"trade languages\") but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], a [[pidgin]] language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is [[English language|English]]. Moreover, a special case of [[English language|English]] is that of [[Basic English]], a simplified version of [[English language|English]] which shares the same grammar (though simplified) and a reduced vocabulary of only 1,000 words, with the intention that anyone with a basic knowledge of [[English language|English]] should be able to understand even quite complex texts. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/best-languages-influence-world/ | title=Languages that Influence the World }}</ref>\n\n===Constructed languages===\n{{main|Constructed language}}\nSince all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar which makes them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue,{{citation needed|date=April 2015|reason=Both assertions in this sentence need to be sourced to a reliable source.}} attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of the 18th century, where [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]], in the article on ''Langue'', wrote a short proposition of a \"laconic\" or regularized grammar of French.\n\nSome of the [[philosophical language]]s of the 17th\u201318th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; [[Solresol]] by [[Fran\u00e7ois Sudre]], a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.\n\n====Volap\u00fck====\n{{main|Volap\u00fck}}\nDuring the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so [[Louis Couturat]] and [[L\u00e9opold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.\n\n[[Volap\u00fck]], first described in an article in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]] and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volap\u00fck conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volap\u00fck as its working language. Andr\u00e9 Cherpillod writes of the third Volap\u00fck convention,{{quote|In August 1889 the third convention was held in Paris. About two hundred people from many countries attended. And, unlike in the first two conventions, people spoke only Volap\u00fck. For the first time in the history of mankind, sixteen years before [[World Congress of Esperanto|the Boulogne convention]], an international convention spoke an international language.<ref name=\"cherpillod1995\">Foreword to ''Konciza Gramatiko de Volapuko'', Andr\u00e9 Cherpillod. Courgenard, 1995.</ref>}}\nHowever, not long after, the Volap\u00fck speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volap\u00fck speakers, and the appearance of newer, [[second-language acquisition|easier-to-learn]] [[constructed language]]s, primarily [[History of Esperanto|Esperanto]].\n\n====From ''Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka'' to ''Academia pro Interlingua''====\n\nAnswering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volap\u00fckists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name [[International Volap\u00fck Academy]] (''Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka'') at the second Volap\u00fck congress in [[Munich]] in August 1887.<ref>Schmidt, Johann. 1964.

Courgenard: La Blancheti\u00e8re. {{ISBN|2-906134-30-9}}</ref> The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language [[Volap\u00fck]], but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volap\u00fckists and those who wanted to reform Volap\u00fck to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major [[world language]]s. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volap\u00fck Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.\n\nUnder [[Waldemar Rosenberger]], who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \"[[Idiom Neutral]]\". The name of the Academy was changed to ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.\n\nIn 1903, the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano]] published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], instead of inventing schematic structures and ''a priori'' language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, [[Latin]]. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named ''Interlingua'' by Peano but is usually referred to as \"[[Latino sine flexione]]\".\n\nImpressed by Peano's Interlingua, the ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to ''[[Academia pro Interlingua]]'' (where ''Interlingua'' stands for Peano's language). The ''Academia pro Interlingua'' survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's Interlingua that inspired the better-known [[Interlingua]] presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\n\n====Esperanto====\n{{main|History of Esperanto}}\n\nAfter the emergence of Volap\u00fck, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s\u20131900s, but none except [[Esperanto]] gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873\u20131887 (a [[Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|first version]] was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], as a primarily schematic language; the word-stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of [[Esperanto vocabulary|derivational word formation]] which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time.{{citation needed| date= September 2017}} From early on, Esperantists created their [[Esperanto culture|own culture]] which helped to form the [[Esperantujo|Esperanto language community]].\n\nWithin a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become \"the most outlandishly successful invented language ever\" and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language.<ref>{{citation\n |title       = Discouraging Words\n |magazine    = [[Failure Magazine]]\n |date        = 2009-07-20\n |first       = Jason\n |last        = Zasky\n |quote       = But in terms of invented languages, it\u2019s the most outlandishly successful invented language ever.

Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called [[Esperantido]]s, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.\n\n====Interlingue and Novial====\n{{main|Interlingue}}\n[[Edgar de Wahl]]'s [[Interlingue]] of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Latino sine flexione]], de Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Interlingue gained a small speaker community in the 1920s and 1930s, and supported several publications, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s.<ref name=\"harlow2000\"/> More recently Interlingue has been revived on the Internet.\n\nIn 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]], abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, [[Novial]].<ref>{{cite web\n |author      = Harlow, Donald J\n |authorlink  = Don Harlow\n |url         = http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#novial\n |title       = Novial\n |work        = How to Build a Language\n |date        = 4 July 2006\n |accessdate  = 12 February 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044938/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#novial\n |archivedate = 4 February 2012\n}}</ref> It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Interlingue, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but soon both Novial and Interlingue were abandoned in favour of [[Interlingua]], the first auxiliary language based fully on scientific methodology.\n\n====Interlingua====\n{{main|History of Interlingua}}\nThe [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA) was founded in 1924 by [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]]; like the earlier ''Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language'', its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. [[History of Interlingua|Interlingua]], published in 1951, was primarily the work of [[Alexander Gode]], though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]], and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, de Walhl's Interlingue, and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Interlingue, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Interlingue, though still less than in any natural language.\n\nThe theory underlying Interlingua posits an ''international vocabulary'', a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to \"all corners of the world\". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred.<ref>Words appearing in only a few, closely related languages were ignored. See Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.</ref> They conducted studies to identify \"the most generally international vocabulary possible\", while still maintaining the unity of the language.<ref>Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company (p. xxii).</ref> This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called ''control languages'') resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.\n\nInterlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely ''understood'' international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.<ref name=\"blandino1989\">Blandino, Giovanni, \"Le problema del linguas international auxiliari\", ''Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia'', Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.</ref> Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.<ref>\"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua,\" ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.</ref>\n\nAfter the creation of Interlingua, there were no more successful attempts in international language engineering that would attract a significant number of supporters, thus the enthusiasm about constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960\u20131990.\n\n===Internet age===\nAll of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html CONLANG mailing list] was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in [[artistic language]]s and [[engineered language]]s grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/auxlang.html AUXLANG mailing list] was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then.  Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including [[Kotava]], [[Lingua Franca Nova]], [[Lingwa de planeta]], [[Pandunia]], and [[Sambahsa]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Libert|first=Alan Reed|date=2018-06-25|title=Artificial Languages|url=http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11}}</ref>\n\n===Zonal constructed languages===\n{{main|Zonal constructed language}}\n\nNot every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale.

This set historically tends to overlap with taxonomic languages, though there is no inherent reason a pasigraphy needs to be taxonomic.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n** [[Logical language]]s such as [[Lojban]] and its predecessor, [[Loglan]], aim to eliminate ambiguity. Both these examples derive their morphemes from a broad range of natural languages using statistical methods.\n* ''A posteriori'' languages are based on existing natural languages. Nearly all the auxiliary languages with fluent speakers are in this category.<ref name=\"harlow2006\">{{cite web |last= Harlow |first= Don |date= 7 January 2006 |title= Essay (hopefully long) |url= http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601a&L=auxlang&P=13620 |work=AUXLANG mailing list  |access-date= {{ date }} | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130523160549/http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601a&L=auxlang&P=13620 | archivedate= 23 May 2013 | url-status= dead}}</ref> Most of the ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages borrow their vocabulary primarily or solely from European languages, and base their grammar more or less on European models. (Sometimes these European-based languages are referred to as \"euroclones\", although this term has negative connotations and is not used in the academic literature.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}) [[Interlingua]] was drawn originally from [[international scientific vocabulary]], in turn based primarily on Greek and Latin roots.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Glosa]] did likewise, with a stronger dependence of Greek roots. Although ''a posteriori'' languages have been based on most of the families of European languages, the most successful of these (notably [[Esperanto]],<ref>http://failuremag.com/feature/article/discouraging_words/</ref> Ido and [[Interlingua]]) have been based largely on Romance elements.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n** Schematic (or \"mixed\") languages have some ''a priori'' qualities.  Some have ethnic [[morpheme]]s but alter them significantly to fit a simplified [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] pattern (e.g., [[Volap\u00fck]]) or both artificial and natural [[morpheme]]s (e.g., [[Perio]]). Partly schematic languages have partly schematic and partly naturalistic derivation (e.g. [[Esperanto]] and Ido). Natural [[morpheme]]s of languages in this group are rarely altered greatly from their source-language form, but compound and derived words are generally not recognizable at sight by people familiar with the source languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n** Naturalistic languages resemble existing natural languages. For example, [[Interlingue]], [[Interlingua]], and [[Lingua Franca Nova]] were developed so that not only the root words but their compounds and derivations will often be recognizable immediately by large numbers of people. Some naturalistic languages do have a limited number of artificial morphemes or invented grammatical devices (e.g. [[Novial]]). (the term \"naturalistic\" as used in auxlang does not mean the same thing as the homophonous term used in describing [[artistic language]]s.<ref>[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&L=CONLANG&D=0&T=0&P=5208 \"Re: \"Naturalistic\" for auxlangers vs artlangers?\"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by J\u00f6rg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009</ref>{{Better source|date=January 2013}})\n** Simplified natural languages reduce the full extent of vocabulary and partially regularize the grammar of a natural language (e.g. [[Basic English]] and [[Special English]].\n\n===Comparison of sample texts===\n\nSome examples of the best known international auxiliary languages are shown below for comparative purposes.

not so much which, but how.<ref>Mario Pei, ''One language for the world'' (1958)</ref> Several approaches exist toward the eventual full expansion and consolidation of an international auxiliary language.\n# Laissez-faire. This approach is taken in the belief that one language will eventually and inevitably \"win out\" as a world auxiliary language (e.g. International English) without any need for specific action.\n# Institutional sponsorship and grass-roots promotion of language programs. This approach has taken various forms, depending on the language and language type, ranging from government promotion of a particular language to one-on-one encouragement to learn the language to instructional or marketing programs.\n# National legislation. This approach seeks to have individual countries (or even localities) progressively endorse a given language as an official language (or to promote the concept of international legislation).\n# International legislation. This approach involves promotion of the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps to be under the auspices of such international organizations as the [[United Nations]] or [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]) to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the [[Baha'i Faith]], seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official [[world language]], to be used in addition to local languages.<ref>See an edited compilation of excerpts from the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings regarding the principle of International or Universal Auxiliary Language: The Greatest Instrument for Promoting Harmony and Civilization: Excerpts from the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Writings and Related Sources on the Question of an International Auxiliary Language. Gregory Paul Meyjes, ed. Oxford: George Ronald. 2015. {{ISBN|978-085398-591-4}}</ref> This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.\n\n==Pictorial languages==\n\nThere have been a number of proposals for using pictures, [[ideograms]], diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original [[Characteristica Universalis]] proposed by the philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], to suggestions for the adoption of [[Chinese writing]], to recent inventions such as [[Blissymbol]].<ref>Charles Keisel Bliss, ''Semantography (Blissymbolics)''</ref>\n\nWithin the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the [[schematics]] used to represent [[circuit diagram|electronic circuits]], [[chemical symbols]], [[mathematical symbols]], and the [[Energy Systems Language]] of [[systems ecology]]. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.\n\n==Sign languages==\n\nAn international auxiliary sign language has been developed by [[deaf]] people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as [[Gestuno]]<ref>Rubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J., ''Gestuno: International sign language of the deaf.''</ref> but now more commonly known simply as '[[International Sign|international sign]]', the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are [[Iconicity|iconic]] and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] was used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].\n\nGestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language [[Signuno]], which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{POV section|date=October 2019}}\nThere has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.\n\nCriticisms directed against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages in the late 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects.<ref name=\"zamenhof1900\">\"Esenco kaj Estonteco de la Ideo de Lingvo Internacia\", L. L. Zamenhof, 1900.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', 1992 [1903].</ref> Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce the diversity of the language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs,<ref name=\"piron1994\"/> or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs.<ref>[http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html \"Farewell to auxiliary languages\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html |date=2012-07-16 }}, by Richard K. Harrison. 1997.</ref>  However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.\n\nOne criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the [[Language death|extinction]] of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs;.<ref name=\"zamenhof1900\"/><ref name=\"oslak2005\">\"\u0108u Zamenhof Pravis?\", Vinko O\u0161lak, ''Fonto'', februaro 2005.</ref> Another response has been that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are often thought to also be proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages{{why|date=May 2013}} and cultures. Based on Baha'i writ, Meyjes (2006) sees an International Auxiliary Language intended to be implemented in ways that shield native tongues from undue pressures from any traditional lingua franca, while enabling inter-community communication worldwide <ref>Also see \"universalization\" in Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 1999.

Hofheim (Ts.): Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Verlag. 129-146</ref>\n\nAlthough referred to as ''international'' languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of [[Western European]] languages.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was common for Volap\u00fck and Esperanto, and to some extent Ido, to be criticized for not being Western European enough; Interlingue and Interlingua were (among other things) responses to this kind of criticism. More recently{{when|date=October 2019}} all these major auxlangs have been criticized for being too European and not global enough.<ref name=\"kupsala2005\">[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&L=AUXLANG&T=0&F=&S=&P=2560 \"Types of neutrality, and central concerns for an IAL\"].  AUXLANG mailing list post by Risto Kupsala, 2 December 2005.</ref>  One response to this criticism has been that doing otherwise in no way makes the language easier for anyone, while drawing away from the sources of much international vocabulary, technical and popular.<ref>Alexander Gode, quoted by Mario Pei in ''One language for the world'' (1958).</ref>  Another response, primarily from Esperanto speakers, is that the internationality of a language has more to do with the culture of its speakers than with its linguistic properties. Esperanto itself uses individual words from Indo-European languages, but its grammar is much more similar to Chinese and Greek, (while being flexible enough in grammar and sentence structure to be able to copy the word-order of Japanese, Indonesian and English all about as well as each other) so it's difficult to judge how much of an Indo-European language it even is.<ref name=\"harlow2006\"/>  The term \"Euroclone\" was coined to refer to these languages in contrast to [[worldlang|\"worldlangs\"]] with global vocabulary sources; the term is sometimes applied only to self-proclaimed \"naturalistic\" auxlangs such as Occidental and Interlingua, sometimes to all auxlangs with primarily European vocabulary sources, regardless of their grammar, including Esperanto and Lingua Franca Nova.\n\nThe response to this argument was made by Alexander Gode<ref>Gode, Alexander, et al. ''Interlingua-English: a dictionary of the international language.'' Storm Publishers, New York, 1951.</ref> and reiterated by Mario Pei:<ref>Pei, Mario. ''One Language for the World.'' N.Y.: Devin-Adair, 1958:</ref> A vocabulary selected from a broad variety of languages does not make the language any easier for speakers of any one language. Gode's example compares a paragraph in Interlingua with a paragraph with words from Chinese, Japanese, Malay, and other non-European languages. The first, he argues, should be understood by those familiar with the Romance languages, and not overly difficult for most English speakers:\n\n:La sol dice: \"io me appella sol. Io es multo brillante. Io me leva al est, e cuando io me leva, il es die. Io reguarda per tu fenestra con mi oculo brillante como le auro, e io te dice quando il es tempore a levar te. E io te dice: 'Pigro, leva te. Io non brilla a fin que tu resta al lecto a dormir, sed que tu lege e que tu te promena.'\"\n\nThe second, in contrast, should not only be difficult for speakers of European languages, but Malay speakers likely will not understand the Chinese words, Chinese speakers will likely not understand the Japanese words, and Japanese speakers likely will not understand the Malay words:\n\n:Mata-hari yu: \"Wo-ti nama mata-hari. Wo taihen brillante. Wo leva wo a est, dan toki wo leva wo, ada hari. Wo miru per ni-ti fenestra sama wo-ti mata brillante como kin, dan wo yu ni toki ada tempo a levar ni. Dan wo yu ni: 'Sust, leva ni. Wo non brilla sam-rap ni tomaru a toko a nemuru, sed wo brilla sam-rap ni leva ni, dan que ni suru kam, ni yomu, dan ni aruku.'\"\n\nAn ''a priori'' vocabulary such as that of [[Spokil]] or [[Kotava]], or a vocabulary constructed mathematically, such as that of [[Loglan]] or [[Lojban]], would likely be as comprehensible.\n\nGode argues, additionally, that the western languages are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, it must be said that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an ''a priori'' one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many proposals for auxlangs based on global sources of vocabulary and grammar have been made, but most (like the majority of the European-based auxlangs of earlier decades) remain sketches too incomplete to be speakable, and of the more complete ones, few have gained any speakers.  More recently there has been a trend, on the AUXLANG mailing list and on the more recently founded [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/worldlanglist/ worldlang mailing list], to greater collaboration between various proponents of a more globally based auxlang.\n\n==See also==\n\nSee '''{{section link|List of constructed languages|Auxiliary languages}}''' for a list of designed international auxiliary languages.\n* [[Interlinguistics]]\n* ''[[International Language Review]]''\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Language planning]]\n* [[Lingua franca]]\n* [[Contemporary Latin#Living Latin|Living Latin]]\n* [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and auxiliary language]]\n* [[Zonal constructed languages]]\n* [[Global language system]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Notelist-ua}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* Bliss, Charles Keisel.
