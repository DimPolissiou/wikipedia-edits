It is located on the island of [[Sumatra]] and has an elevation of 35 meters. The city covers an area of 61.4 square kilometres and had a population of 223,446 people at the 2010 Census, rising to 250,227\tat the 2015 Census; the latest official estimate (as at mid-2019) is 268,148.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref> Banda Aceh is located on the northwestern tip of Indonesia at the mouth of the [[Aceh River]].\n\nThe city was originally established as Bandar Aceh Darussalam Kandang<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harun|first1=Ramli|last2=M.A. Gani|first2=Tjut Rahma|title=Adat Aceh|date=1985|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|location=Jakarta|page=24}}</ref> and served as a capital and hub for the [[Sultanate of Aceh]] upon its foundation in the late 15th century. Later its name was changed to ''Bandar Aceh Darussalam''''',''' and then became popularly known as ''Banda Aceh''. The first part of the name comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''bandar'' (\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631) meaning \"port\" or \"haven\". The city is also dubbed the \"port to Mecca,\" or the \"porch of [[Mecca]]\" (Indonesian: ''Serambi Mekkah'') in reference to the days when [[hajj]] pilgrims travelled by sea from Indonesia and would make a stopover in the city before continuing their journey to Mecca.\n\nBanda Aceh had long been at the centre of protracted conflicts between the Acehnese and foreign domination, including war with Portuguese, [[Aceh War|wars with the Dutch]], the Japanese, and [[insurgency in Aceh|the Indonesian government]]. The city rose to international prominence in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean earthquake]] in 2004, which struck off the western coast of Sumatra.  Banda Aceh was the closest major city to the earthquake's [[epicentre]], which lay 249&nbsp;km off the coast.<ref>John Pike, '[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/indonesia/banda-aceh.htm Banda Aceh'], accessed 23 January 2011.</ref> It suffered great damage in the earthquake and further damage when a [[tsunami]] struck shortly afterwards. 167,000 people died as a result and many more were injured.<ref>Jayasuriya, Sisira and Peter McCawley in collaboration with Bhanupong Nidhiprabha, Budy P.

Its first mention in western accounts comes from 1292 when [[Marco Polo]] and his expedition visited the city, referred to as 'Lambri' from [[Lamuri Kingdom]] which previously existed there and noted as the logical first port of call for travellers from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[India]] to [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian|last = Polo|first = Marco|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-108-02207-1|location = Cambridge, UK|pages = 243}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]] also reported visiting the city in the mid-14th century when under the control of the trading kingdom of [[Samudera Pasai]], the then-dominant entity in northern Sumatra.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mapping the Acehnese Past|last = Feener|first = R. Michael|publisher = KITLV Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-90-6718-365-9|location = Leiden, NL|pages = 43}}</ref> However the Pasai began to collapse under pressure from declining economic conditions and the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], who occupied much of the area after occupying Malacca in the early 15th century. Sultan [[Ali Mughayat Syah]], ruler of the newly founded [[Sultanate of Aceh]], aggressively expanded in the area in the 1520s and established sultanate was built on the remains of the Pasai and other extinct kingdoms in the area, and made Banda Aceh the capital, naming it for himself as ''Kutaraja ''or 'City of the King'.[[File:AMH-6875-KB View of Achin.jpg|thumb|left|Koetaradja/Banda Aceh old map]]After a long period of rule by the Sultanate, Aceh began to come into conflict with the Dutch and the British in the second half of the 18th century. At the end of the 18th century, the territory of Aceh in the Malay Peninsula, namely [[Kedah]] and [[Pulau Pinang]], were seized by the British. In 1871, the Dutch began to threaten Aceh, and on 26 March 1873, the Dutch formally declared war on Aceh. The Dutch bombarded the capital in that year and sought to capture the Sultan's palace in the city to bring about a capitulation of the Acehnese. Significant support from the British in the region led the modernisation and fortification of the city, and while coastal areas were lost the Dutch underestimated the city's defences. The Dutch expedition commander General [[Johan Harmen Rudolf K\u00f6hler|Johan K\u00f6hler]] was killed in a skirmish around the city, leading to the failure of the [[First Aceh Expedition|first expedition]]. A second expedition was mounted by the Dutch within months and was successful in overwhelming the city. The Dutch moved into the capital in January 1874 believing the Acehnese to have surrendered; however, the conflict moved into the countryside, and the Acehnese continued to actively oppose Dutch rule. \n[[File:US Navy 050106-N-4166B-024 An aerial view of Tsunami-stricken Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Banda Aceh aerial view after the tsunami disaster, 2004]]\nAfter it entered the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on 28 December 1962, the name of the city was changed back to Banda Aceh by the Ministry of Public Administration and Regional Autonomy on 9 May 1963. On 26 December 2004, the city [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|was hit]] by a [[tsunami]] caused by a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The disaster killed 167,000 inhabitants and destroyed more than 60% of the city's buildings. Based on the statistical data issued by the City Government of Banda Aceh, Banda Aceh had 248,727 inhabitants in May 2012. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n[[File:Kant\u00f4 Walikota.JPG|thumb|Mayor office of Banda Aceh]]\nBanda Aceh is divided into nine [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] ({{lang-id|kecamatan}}), listed below with their areas and populations at the 2010 Census:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These include several mass burial centres such as the graves at Ulee Lheue, places where boats were carried several kilometres inland by the tsunami ([[Apung 1|PLTD Apung 1]], or the \"Floating Diesel Plant\", and the \"Floating Boat on the Roof\"), and the [[Aceh Tsunami Museum|Tsunami Museum]].  The PLTD Apung 1 had been located near the Ule Lheu beach before being shifted close to the city centre by the tsunami. It has become one of the most important landmarks in Banda Aceh.\n* Dutch Kerkhof Poucut Cemetery is a Dutch military burial ground located near the centre of Banda Aceh, next to the tsunami museum. The cemetery name is a combination of ''Kerkhof'' (Dutch for ''churchyard'' or ''graveyard'') and ''poucut'' or ''poteu cut'' (Acehnese for ''prince''). The Kerkhoff Poucut is recorded as the largest Dutch military cemetery outside the Netherlands. There are around 2,200 graves of white Dutch soldiers as well as recruits from Ambon, Manado and Java, and several Dutch generals.<ref>Hotli Semanjuntak, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/20/kerkhoff-poucut-cemetery-testifying-aceh-war.html Kerkhoff Poucut Cemetery, testifying to the Aceh War'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 20 March 2012.</ref>\n* The [[Aceh Museum]] is one of the oldest museums in Indonesia.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The original museum was established almost 100 years ago.

It is located on the island of [[Sumatra]] and has an elevation of 35 meters. The city covers an area of 61.4 square kilometres and had a population of 223,446 people at the 2010 Census, rising to 250,227\tat the 2015 Census; the latest official estimate (as at mid 2019) is 268,148.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref> Banda Aceh is located on the northwestern tip of Indonesia at the mouth of the [[Aceh River]].\n\nThe city was originally established as Bandar Aceh Darussalam Kandang<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harun|first1=Ramli|last2=M.A. Gani|first2=Tjut Rahma|title=Adat Aceh|date=1985|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|location=Jakarta|page=24}}</ref> and served as a capital and hub for the [[Sultanate of Aceh]] upon its foundation in the late 15th century. Later its name was changed to ''Bandar Aceh Darussalam''''',''' and then became popularly known as ''Banda Aceh''. The first part of the name comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''bandar'' (\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631) meaning \"port\" or \"haven\". The city is also dubbed the \"port to Mecca,\" or the \"porch of [[Mecca]]\" (Indonesian: ''Serambi Mekkah'') in reference to the days when [[hajj]] pilgrims travelled by sea from Indonesia and would make a stop over in the city before continuing their journey to Mecca.\n\nBanda Aceh had long been at the centre of protracted conflicts between the Acehnese and foreign domination, including war with Portuguese, [[Aceh War|wars with the Dutch]], the Japanese and [[insurgency in Aceh|the Indonesian government]]. The city rose to international prominence in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean earthquake]] in 2004, which struck off the western coast of Sumatra.  Banda Aceh was the closest major city to the earthquake's [[epicentre]], which lay 249&nbsp;km off the coast.<ref>John Pike, '[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/indonesia/banda-aceh.htm Banda Aceh'], accessed 23 January 2011.</ref> It suffered great damage in the earthquake and further damage when a [[tsunami]] struck shortly afterwards. 167,000 people died as a result and many more were injured.<ref>Jayasuriya, Sisira and Peter McCawley in collaboration with Bhanupong Nidhiprabha, Budy P.

Its first mention in western accounts comes from 1292 when [[Marco Polo]] and his expedition visited the city, referred to as 'Lambri' from [[Lamuri Kingdom]] which previously existed there and noted as the logical first port of call for travellers from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[India]] to [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian|last = Polo|first = Marco|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-108-02207-1|location = Cambridge, UK|pages = 243}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]] also reported visiting the city in the mid-14th century when under the control of the trading kingdom of [[Samudera Pasai]], the then dominant entity in northern Sumatra.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mapping the Acehnese Past|last = Feener|first = R.

Sultan [[Ali Mughayat Syah]], ruler of the newly founded [[Sultanate of Aceh]], aggressively expanded in the area in the 1520s and established sultanate was built on the remains of the Pasai and other extinct kingdoms in the area, and made Banda Aceh the capital, naming it for himself as ''Kutaraja ''or 'City of the King'.[[File:AMH-6875-KB View of Achin.jpg|thumb|left|Koetaradja/Banda Aceh old map]]After a long period of rule by the Sultanate, Aceh began to come into conflict with the Dutch and the British in the second half of the 18th century. At the end of the 18th century, the territory of Aceh in the Malay Peninsula, namely [[Kedah]] and [[Pulau Pinang]], were seized by the British. In 1871, the Dutch began to threaten Aceh, and on 26 March 1873, the Dutch formally declared war on Aceh. The Dutch bombarded the capital in that year and sought to capture the Sultan's palace in the city to bring about a capitulation of the Acehnese. Significant support from the British in the region led the modernisation and fortification of the city, and while coastal areas were lost the Dutch underestimated the city's defences. The Dutch expedition commander General [[Johan Harmen Rudolf K\u00f6hler|Johan K\u00f6hler]] was killed in a skirmish around the city, leading to the failure of the [[First Aceh Expedition|first expedition]]. A second expedition was mounted by the Dutch within months and was successful in overwhelming the city. The Dutch moved into the capital in January 1874 believing the Acehnese to have surrendered; however, the conflict moved into the countryside, and the Acehnese continued to actively oppose Dutch rule. \n[[File:US Navy 050106-N-4166B-024 An aerial view of Tsunami-stricken Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Banda Aceh aerial view after tsunami disaster, 2004]]\nAfter it entered the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on 28 December 1962, the name of the city was changed back to Banda Aceh by the Ministry of Public Administration and Regional Autonomy on 9 May 1963.

The cemetery name is a combination of ''Kerkhof'' (Dutch for ''churchyard'' or ''graveyard'') and ''poucut'' or ''poteu cut'' (Acehnese for ''prince''). The Kerkhoff Poucut is recorded as the largest Dutch military cemetery outside the Netherlands.

A love triangle soon develops between a key witness, Christine Downes ([[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]]), and the two principal leads.\n\n==Plot==\nA stripper runs out onto a Los Angeles street in the Little Tokyo district, in a state of undress, mortally wounded by a gunshot. Police detectives Joe Kojaku and Charlie Bancroft, partners and bachelors who share an apartment, are assigned to the case. They find portraits of the stripper, known as Sugar Torch, dressed in a [[kimono]] as a [[geisha]], apparently preparing a Japanese-themed act.\n\nThe cops search for a man who had been helping the stripper with her act. They interview a student artist, Christine Downes, who draws a sketch of the man for them, and Charlie develops a romantic attraction to her. They meet a man named Hansel who did the portrait of the dead woman and a wigmaker, Roma, who provided the wig for the stage act.\n\nJoe worries for Christine's safety, that her sketch could result in the killer coming after her. He, too, begins to fall for Chris, and the interest is mutual. Charlie's facial reaction makes Joe believe that he resents the multi-racial nature of the relationship. Joe aggressively attacks Charlie during a martial-arts competition, then decides to quit the force, disillusioned after having felt for so long that his partner was free of this kind of racial bias. Charlie confronts Joe, telling him that the look he saw on his face was a flash of hatred for the envy and betrayal he felt towards Joe and his relationship with Chris, and was not racism. Joe doesn't believe him.\n\nA shot is taken at Christine, and it is assumed Hansel is the man behind the killings. It instead turns out to be Roma, who considered the stripper a threat to her relationship with Hansel because of a look that Hansel gave Sugar Torch. Joe relates this to Charlie, and realizes that just as Roma saw what she wanted in Hansel's face, Joe projected his own struggles with racism onto Charlie. After Roma's arrest, Joe asks Charlie if they can still be partners. He replies with a no, citing his bad feelings about Joe and Chris's relationship, but adding that he is, nevertheless, glad that Joe has \"wrapped his own case\".
