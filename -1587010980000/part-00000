The character was created for the television series by writers [[Frank Darabont]], [[Charles H. Eglee]] and [[Jack LoGiudice]] specifically for [[Norman Reedus]], and does not have a counterpart in the comics on which the series is based. The character was introduced in the [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|first season]] as a southerner, expert [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]], living in the shadow of his older brother, [[Merle Dixon|Merle]]. Despite his ill temper and volatility, he is tolerated by the core group of survivors due to his skills in hunting animals and fearless efficiency in killing [[Zombie (fictional)|walkers]]. This is particularly important in the early days of the apocalypse, when people with survival skills and the moxie to confront the undead are in short supply.\n\nAfter Merle's disappearance, Daryl sheds his aloof personality and starts to bond with the group, particularly [[Carol Peletier]] after her [[Sophia Peletier|daughter's]] [[What Lies Ahead|disappearance]], and [[Beth Greene]] after the two split off together in season 4. The character becomes the cooperative right-hand man and protector of protagonist [[Rick Grimes]] and leads several supply runs. He is the longest surviving character of the television series. His origin is explored in the 2013 video game ''[[The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct]]'', and he stars in the mobile game ''The Walking Dead: No Man's Land.''\n\nDaryl has been well received by fans and critics. Initially a member of the recurring cast, Reedus was upgraded to series regular after season one. Following [[Andrew Lincoln]]'s [[What Comes After (The Walking Dead)|departure]] as Rick, Reedus got top billing and has taken over as the series' main protagonist beginning from [[The Walking Dead (season 9)|season 9]].\n\n==Appearances=\njust tell me how old he is\nIn their childhood, Daryl and his older brother, [[Merle Dixon|Merle]], lived with an abusive, alcoholic father, Will. He was raised by Merle, though Merle was often away (serving time in juvenile institutions). Daryl had significant periods of time alone and, throughout these lonely periods, learned to fend for himself and adopted a hard-boiled survivalist mindset. When the outbreak occurs he and Merle fend for themselves and drift around, avoiding walkers. Unlike his brother, Daryl has never been to prison (as an inmate), and was offended when Beth revealed to him that she had believed he had during a drinking game in season 4.\n\nIt is implied in [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|season 1]] that he shares his brother's racist beliefs, but Daryl has not expressed overt racism, leaving the question ambiguous for the viewer, except when using several times the expression \"Chinaman\" towards Glenn while he specifically says he is of Korean origin.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In much of season 2, Daryl rides his brother Merle's [[Triumph Bonneville]] [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]] with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] '''\u16cb\u16cb''' ([[Schutzstaffel]]) insignia prominently displayed on the fuel tank. In the final episode of season 2, Daryl jokes that he could identify [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]] by his driving, [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|due to Glenn being Korean]]. Daryl usually has a serious demeanor, but occasionally makes wry comments and jokes to break the tension. By season 3, he has become a responsible, trusted and loyal member of the group. His priorities are tested when he learns that his brother is still alive and working for an opposing group.\n\n===Season 1===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 1)}}\nDaryl is first introduced in the Season 1 episode \"[[Tell It to the Frogs]]\". Having been a hunter to secure wildlife for nourishment of the survivor group outside of Atlanta, he is furious to learn they left Merle handcuffed to plumbing atop a skyscraper in the city, and puts most of his anger on Rick, the newcomer of the group. Daryl joins Rick and others to return to the city, finding that Merle escaped by cutting off his hand. Daryl becomes one of the group's key fighters, but falls in under Rick's orders as they abandon Atlanta, driving his brother's motorcycle.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 2)}}\nIn Season 2, the group settles onto Hershel Greene's farmstead as they look for [[Carol Peletier|Carol]]'s missing daughter [[Sophia Peletier|Sophia]] after a walker attack. Daryl aids in the search, and tries to help Carol cope with her feelings.\n\nDuring one solo outing, he is knocked from a horse and suffers hallucinations of Merle, complaining that he is spending time searching for Sophia and not for him, before returning to the group. After Sophia is discovered to have already been turned in a walker and hidden away in Hershel's barn, Daryl helps Carol to cope with her loss. He helps protect the group as they deal with a potential threat of hostile survivors nearby, and to help evacuate the farm when it is overrun by walkers.\n\n===Season 3=== \n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 3)}}\nRick's group find and secure a prison as a new shelter at the start of Season 3. In dealing with this, Rick's wife [[Lori Grimes|Lori]] dies after giving birth to her daughter, and Rick is devastated, having hallucinations of her and unable to make decisions. Daryl steps up to help lead the group alongside Hershel during Rick's lapse. His friendship with Carol strengthens after she was feared lost dealing with the walkers.\n\nThe group is forced to deal with [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|the Governor]] from the nearby Woodbury community, who seeks to kill them and take their supplies for himself. In rescuing two of their allies kidnapped by the Governor, Daryl discovers Merle is still alive, having escaped Atlanta, but working for the Governor. After the Governor considers Merle a traitor, Daryl helps him to escape and returns with him to the prison. Rick's group knows the Governor seeks to capture [[Michonne]] or else attack the prison, but Rick's hallucinations leave him unable to make the decision, and Merle takes Michonne himself to the Governor, with Daryl following him after discovering his absence. Merle had a change of heart, lets Michonne go, and sacrificially ambushes the Governor's men. Daryl arrives to find the reanimated corpse of Merle, killed by the Governor, and cries as he is forced to put his brother down. Rick's group fends off a major attack by the Governor, driving him away, and bring the survivors of Woodbury to the prison.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 4)}}\nRick has recovered from Lori's death, and he, Daryl, and Hershel lead the growing population. A flu-like epidemic strikes the prison, killing many before a cure is found. Carol takes initiative to kill two who have shown signs of the flu in secret, and when Rick discovers this, evicts her from the group, upsetting Daryl.\n\nThe Governor, having obtained more men, launch a fatal assault on the prison, forcing the survivors to flee in separate groups. Daryl rescues [[Beth Greene|Beth]] who is catatonic after watching the Governor behead her father Hershel. After days of traveling, Beth opens up to Daryl, and the two get drunk on [[moonshine]] as they talk about and let go of their pasts. A few days later, the two are briefly separated while fleeing walkers, and Daryl sees Beth kidnapped by men in a car with a white cross on it. He tries to follow them but is caught by Joe and a small group of bandits, the Claimers, and they force him to stay with them. The group later captures Rick, Carl, and Michonne, but Rick and Daryl fight back when they attempt to rape Carl and Michonne, killing all of the Claimers.\n\nThe four travel to Terminus, a safe haven according to signs along a railroad track. Though the community seems open, they find evidence that their friends have been captured. The four are taken prisoner and taken to the others, with Rick asserting they messed with the wrong group.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 5)}}\nRick's group escapes Terminus after discovering they engage in cannibalism, and with the help of Carol, who had launched a walker horde on the site. After meeting [[Gabriel Stokes (The Walking Dead)|Fr. Gabriel Stokes]] at his church, the group makes plans to head to Washington D.C. While Daryl and Carol are catching up, they see a car drive by with a similar white cross on it, and they give chase. This leads them to find that Beth was taken to Gracy Memorial Hospital, where she was forced to work on patients there by corrupt cops. After Carol is captured, Daryl lead Rick's group to try to rescue them. Carol is saved but Beth is killed in a standoff with the cops, and Daryl returns her body to the church to bury her.\n\nThe group continues on, eventually meeting Aaron, a recruiter for the Alexandria Safe-Zone in Virginia, who offers them sanctuary there. Like Rick, Daryl remains skeptical given the lack of survival experience the residents have, but accepts Aaron's offer to assist them in finding more recruits. Daryl and Aaron find the community is being watched by the Wolves, exiles from Alexandria that seek revenge. After walking into a Wolves trap, they are rescued by Morgan Jones, Rick's friend before he met the rest of the group in Atlanta, and they bring him back to Alexandria.\n\n===Season 6===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 6)}}\n\nRick and the others of his group are put in charge of Alexandria after proving their survival skills. To get rid of a walker horde trapped in a nearby quarry, Rick plans to parade them far away from Alexandria. Daryl, along with Abraham and Sasha, lead the parade. However, the Wolves launch a surprise attack, breaking the parade, through Rick instructs Daryl to lead the remaining away. The attack breeches the Alexandria walls, allowing walkers to swarm in. After leading the remaining walkers away, Daryl is briefly waylaid by [[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]] and his wife Sherry. He finds a fuel truck, and regroups with Abraham and Sasha, and quickly deals with a group of men working for [[Negan]]. They ignite the truck in Alexandria to lure the walkers away from the citizens to dispatch them.\n\nAs Alexandria is recovering, Carol opts to leave on her own, concerned about seeing others she cares for die, leaving Daryl upset. Rick and Daryl meet [[Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe|Jesus]] and are introduced to the Hilltop community. They request help dealing with the Saviors, a brutal group that demand supplies as a periodic offering. Rick, Daryl and others launch an attack on a Savior outpost, appearing to kill Negan and all of the Saviors. Later, Daryl encounters Dwight again with other men who claim to be Saviors working for Negan. After reporting this to Rick and the others, Daryl patrols to track down the Saviors but is soon captured. He is brought to a clearing along with Rick and several others of the group that has been captured by the Saviors, and they met the real Negan, who wields a baseball bat wrapped with barbed wired named \"Lucille\". Negan prepares to kill one of the group in retaliation for the attack on the Savior compound and force them to swear loyalty to him.\n\n===Season 7===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 7)}}\nAfter Negan chooses Abraham to kill, Daryl attacks him but he is held back by the Saviors. Negan proceeds to kill Glenn, and then convinces Rick to agree to his terms. Daryl is taken prisoner by Dwight back to Sanctuary, the Savior's base. Dwight attempts to convert him to join Negan, but Daryl refuses. Later, Sherry helps Daryl to escape, and he is helped to Hilltop by Jesus, where Rick and others are meeting to discuss the situation with Negan. After a tearful reunion, they all agree Daryl is a fugitive from Negan and Jesus suggest he go to the Kingdom run by King Ezekiel for safety as well as to try to convince Ezekiel to help. There, Ezekiel remains non-committed as his deal with Negan is amicable, but offers Daryl shelter.\n\nWhile there, one of Ezekiel's men, Richard, suggests a plan to lure Ezekiel into fighting the Saviors, by having the Savior kill a woman that Ekeziel has taken a liking to but staying outside of the Kingdom. Daryl realizes this is Carol, and refuses to go along with the plan. He opts to return to Hilltop, but stops to reunite with Carol on his way out. After debriefing the Hilltop community, he apologizes to Maggie for Glenn's death and she forgives him. Daryl then returns to Alexandria, and helped prepare for a plan to attack Negan the next time he comes. However, they find Dwight has arrived, who swears that he wants to help them stop Negan despite Daryl's reservations. Negan does launch a surprise attack on Alexandria, but the timely arrival of the Hilltop and Kingdom communities allow them to overpower the Saviors and their allies, the Scavengers, and the three communities agree to go to war against Negan. Daryl finds a note from Dwight swearing he did not know what Negan had planned.\n\n===Season 8===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 8)}}\nDaryl is first seen in the season premiere [[Mercy (The Walking Dead)|\"Mercy\"]], where he is key to their plan to attack the Sanctuary by luring a massive walker herd using placed explosives and his motorcycle. After their plan succeeds, he splits off with Rick to attack a compound housing Savior weaponry. [[Monsters (The Walking Dead)|\"Monsters\"]] shows Daryl and Rick searching the compound for the guns to no avail; unlike Rick, who is beginning to question their decision to go to war, Daryl has zero qualms about their mission, killing former Atlanta survivor Morales and executing a Savior who Rick promised mercy to. He is still distrusting of Dwight.\n\nWhen Rick and Daryl have a misunderstanding, their newly acquired weapons are accidentally set ablaze as they fight. After Dwight is later exposed as a mole, one Savior gets away after the rest are shot, and then Dwight asks to be spared. As he is led away, Daryl takes back his vest.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 10, 2017|title='Walking Dead' Recap: Tide of War Turns in Midseason Finale (SPOILERS)|author=Otterson, Joe|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/walking-dead-recap-season-8-midseason-finale-1202635498/}}</ref> Despite this, Daryl remains hostile to Dwight and expressly states his intention of killing him once the war is over. Though Tara initially agrees with him on this, she changes her mind after Dwight saves her life twice.\n\nIn the season finale, Daryl takes part in the final battle with the Saviors and survives. Afterwards, he drives Dwight out into the woods where Dwight expects Daryl to execute him. Instead, Daryl exiles Dwight on threat of death if he ever returns and encourages his former enemy to seek out his wife Sherry.\n\n===Season 9===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 9)}}\nEighteen months have passed since [[Wrath (The Walking Dead)|Rick defeated Negan]]. The communities of Alexandria, the Hilltop, the Kingdom, Oceanside, and the Sanctuary have rebuilt what they can to make more viable societies. Daryl and Eugene oversee the remaining Saviors at the Sanctuary, where infertile ground makes it difficult to grow anything. Justin, a Savior, tries to take more than his share and pushes Henry. Daryl rushes in to subdue Justin before Rick can assert his control on the group. Rick and Daryl realize the Saviors are starting to get out of hand, due to Rick's hurry to finish the bridge and the lack of food. Later, they set off the dynamite, and track the nearby walker horde as it diverts towards the first siren. However, when the second siren, manned by Justin, fails to sound, Rick realizes the group of men at a logging site nearby are in trouble. There, Daryl sees the horde and orders everyone to flee, but in the haste, Aaron's arm is crushed under a giant log.\n\n===Season 10===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 10)}}\n{{Empty section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Weapons==\n\nDaryl used a Horton Scout HD 125 [[crossbow]] for the first three seasons. The character's use has inspired reviews of the weapon at [[Amazon.com]] referring to the show. It was replaced by a more powerful Stryker StrykeZone 380 during Season 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensfitness.com/life/entertainment/norman-reedus-the-walking-man|title=Norman Reedus: The Walking Man|author=Dean, Josh|publisher=Boys Fitness|accessdate=March 23, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011039/http://www.mensfitness.com/life/entertainment/norman-reedus-the-walking-man|archivedate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> In season 6 episode 9, Daryl uses an Airtronic RPG-7 to take out a biker gang working for Negan.

He was asked to come in and read lines. They picked Merle's lines, which is why the rumor still abounds that he read for the role of Merle, but Rooker already had the part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/walking-dead-audition-stories-815523/9-norman-reedus-daryl|title='The Walking Dead' Audition Tales: 31 Stars Tell All|website=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=9 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019011027/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/walking-dead-audition-stories-815523/9-norman-reedus-daryl|archivedate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-walking-dead-star-norman-reedus-got-cast-2015-10|title='The Walking Dead' star Norman Reedus almost didn't get cast \u2014 here's how being persistent got him a lead role|website=businessinsider.com|accessdate=9 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019003418/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-walking-dead-star-norman-reedus-got-cast-2015-10|archivedate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Designtrend.com|title='The Walking Dead' Star Norman Reedus On How He Actually Landed The Role Of Daryl Dixon|author=Saclao, Christian|date=October 9, 2015|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/62446/20151009/the-walking-dead-norman-reedus-how-he-actually-landed-the-role-of-daryl-dixon.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101161221/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/62446/20151009/the-walking-dead-norman-reedus-how-he-actually-landed-the-role-of-daryl-dixon.htm|archivedate=2017-01-01}}</ref> They liked his audition and gave him the role of Daryl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daryl Dixon Robert Kirkman's \"Favorite Element\" of TV Show|url=http://1337wiki.com/daryl-dixon-robert-kirkmans-favorite-element-of-tv-show/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923004606/http://1337wiki.com/daryl-dixon-robert-kirkmans-favorite-element-of-tv-show/|archivedate=2015-09-23|access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> Daryl was originally a recurring character but was upgraded to the main cast in season two.

This is particularly important in the early days of the apocalypse, when people with survival skills and the moxie to confront the undead are in short supply.\n\nAfter Merle's disappearance, Daryl sheds his aloof personality and starts to bond with the group, particularly [[Carol Peletier]] after her [[Sophia Peletier|daughter's]] [[What Lies Ahead|disappearance]], and [[Beth Greene]] after the two split off together in season 4. The character becomes the cooperative right-hand man and protector of protagonist [[Rick Grimes]] and leads several supply runs. He is the longest surviving character of the television series. His origin is explored in the 2013 video game ''[[The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct]]'', and he stars in the mobile game ''The Walking Dead: No Man's Land.''\n\nDaryl has been well received by fans and critics. Initially a member of the recurring cast, Reedus was upgraded to series regular after season one. Following [[Andrew Lincoln]]'s [[What Comes After (The Walking Dead)|departure]] as Rick, Reedus got top billing and has taken over as the series' main protagonist beginning from [[The Walking Dead (season 9)|season 9]].\n\n==Appearances==\nIn their childhood, Daryl and his older brother, [[Merle Dixon|Merle]], lived with an abusive, alcoholic father, Will. He was raised by Merle, though Merle was often away (serving time in juvenile institutions). Daryl had significant periods of time alone and, throughout these lonely periods, learned to fend for himself and adopted a hard-boiled survivalist mindset. When the outbreak occurs he and Merle fend for themselves and drift around, avoiding walkers. Unlike his brother, Daryl has never been to prison (as an inmate), and was offended when Beth revealed to him that she had believed he had during a drinking game in season 4.\n\nIt is implied in [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|season 1]] that he shares his brother's racist beliefs, but Daryl has not expressed overt racism, leaving the question ambiguous for the viewer, except when using several times the expression \"Chinaman\" towards Glenn while he specifically says he is of Korean origin.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In much of season 2, Daryl rides his brother Merle's [[Triumph Bonneville]] [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]] with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] '''\u16cb\u16cb''' ([[Schutzstaffel]]) insignia prominently displayed on the fuel tank. In the final episode of season 2, Daryl jokes that he could identify [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]] by his driving, [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|due to Glenn being Korean]]. Daryl usually has a serious demeanor, but occasionally makes wry comments and jokes to break the tension. By season 3, he has become a responsible, trusted and loyal member of the group. His priorities are tested when he learns that his brother is still alive and working for an opposing group.\n\n===Season 1===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 1)}}\nDaryl is first introduced in the Season 1 episode \"[[Tell It to the Frogs]]\". Having been a hunter to secure wildlife for nourishment of the survivor group outside of Atlanta, he is furious to learn they left Merle handcuffed to plumbing atop a skyscraper in the city, and puts most of his anger on Rick, the newcomer of the group. Daryl joins Rick and others to return to the city, finding that Merle escaped by cutting off his hand. Daryl becomes one of the group's key fighters, but falls in under Rick's orders as they abandon Atlanta, driving his brother's motorcycle.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 2)}}\nIn Season 2, the group settles onto Hershel Greene's farmstead as they look for [[Carol Peletier|Carol]]'s missing daughter [[Sophia Peletier|Sophia]] after a walker attack. Daryl aids in the search, and tries to help Carol cope with her feelings.\n\nDuring one solo outing, he is knocked from a horse and suffers hallucinations of Merle, complaining that he is spending time searching for Sophia and not for him, before returning to the group. After Sophia is discovered to have already been turned in a walker and hidden away in Hershel's barn, Daryl helps Carol to cope with her loss. He helps protect the group as they deal with a potential threat of hostile survivors nearby, and to help evacuate the farm when it is overrun by walkers.\n\n===Season 3=== \n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 3)}}\nRick's group find and secure a prison as a new shelter at the start of Season 3. In dealing with this, Rick's wife [[Lori Grimes|Lori]] dies after giving birth to her daughter, and Rick is devastated, having hallucinations of her and unable to make decisions. Daryl steps up to help lead the group alongside Hershel during Rick's lapse. His friendship with Carol strengthens after she was feared lost dealing with the walkers.\n\nThe group is forced to deal with [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|the Governor]] from the nearby Woodbury community, who seeks to kill them and take their supplies for himself. In rescuing two of their allies kidnapped by the Governor, Daryl discovers Merle is still alive, having escaped Atlanta, but working for the Governor. After the Governor considers Merle a traitor, Daryl helps him to escape and returns with him to the prison. Rick's group knows the Governor seeks to capture [[Michonne]] or else attack the prison, but Rick's hallucinations leave him unable to make the decision, and Merle takes Michonne himself to the Governor, with Daryl following him after discovering his absence. Merle had a change of heart, lets Michonne go, and sacrificially ambushes the Governor's men. Daryl arrives to find the reanimated corpse of Merle, killed by the Governor, and cries as he is forced to put his brother down. Rick's group fends off a major attack by the Governor, driving him away, and bring the survivors of Woodbury to the prison.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 4)}}\nRick has recovered from Lori's death, and he, Daryl, and Hershel lead the growing population. A flu-like epidemic strikes the prison, killing many before a cure is found. Carol takes initiative to kill two who have shown signs of the flu in secret, and when Rick discovers this, evicts her from the group, upsetting Daryl.\n\nThe Governor, having obtained more men, launch a fatal assault on the prison, forcing the survivors to flee in separate groups. Daryl rescues [[Beth Greene|Beth]] who is catatonic after watching the Governor behead her father Hershel. After days of traveling, Beth opens up to Daryl, and the two get drunk on [[moonshine]] as they talk about and let go of their pasts. A few days later, the two are briefly separated while fleeing walkers, and Daryl sees Beth kidnapped by men in a car with a white cross on it. He tries to follow them but is caught by Joe and a small group of bandits, the Claimers, and they force him to stay with them. The group later captures Rick, Carl, and Michonne, but Rick and Daryl fight back when they attempt to rape Carl and Michonne, killing all of the Claimers.\n\nThe four travel to Terminus, a safe haven according to signs along a railroad track. Though the community seems open, they find evidence that their friends have been captured. The four are taken prisoner and taken to the others, with Rick asserting they messed with the wrong group.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 5)}}\nRick's group escapes Terminus after discovering they engage in cannibalism, and with the help of Carol, who had launched a walker horde on the site. After meeting [[Gabriel Stokes (The Walking Dead)|Fr. Gabriel Stokes]] at his church, the group makes plans to head to Washington D.C. While Daryl and Carol are catching up, they see a car drive by with a similar white cross on it, and they give chase. This leads them to find that Beth was taken to Gracy Memorial Hospital, where she was forced to work on patients there by corrupt cops. After Carol is captured, Daryl lead Rick's group to try to rescue them. Carol is saved but Beth is killed in a standoff with the cops, and Daryl returns her body to the church to bury her.\n\nThe group continues on, eventually meeting Aaron, a recruiter for the Alexandria Safe-Zone in Virginia, who offers them sanctuary there. Like Rick, Daryl remains skeptical given the lack of survival experience the residents have, but accepts Aaron's offer to assist them in finding more recruits. Daryl and Aaron find the community is being watched by the Wolves, exiles from Alexandria that seek revenge. After walking into a Wolves trap, they are rescued by Morgan Jones, Rick's friend before he met the rest of the group in Atlanta, and they bring him back to Alexandria.\n\n===Season 6===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 6)}}\n\nRick and the others of his group are put in charge of Alexandria after proving their survival skills. To get rid of a walker horde trapped in a nearby quarry, Rick plans to parade them far away from Alexandria. Daryl, along with Abraham and Sasha, lead the parade. However, the Wolves launch a surprise attack, breaking the parade, through Rick instructs Daryl to lead the remaining away. The attack breeches the Alexandria walls, allowing walkers to swarm in. After leading the remaining walkers away, Daryl is briefly waylaid by [[Dwight (The Walking Dead)|Dwight]] and his wife Sherry. He finds a fuel truck, and regroups with Abraham and Sasha, and quickly deals with a group of men working for [[Negan]]. They ignite the truck in Alexandria to lure the walkers away from the citizens to dispatch them.\n\nAs Alexandria is recovering, Carol opts to leave on her own, concerned about seeing others she cares for die, leaving Daryl upset. Rick and Daryl meet [[Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe|Jesus]] and are introduced to the Hilltop community. They request help dealing with the Saviors, a brutal group that demand supplies as a periodic offering. Rick, Daryl and others launch an attack on a Savior outpost, appearing to kill Negan and all of the Saviors. Later, Daryl encounters Dwight again with other men who claim to be Saviors working for Negan. After reporting this to Rick and the others, Daryl patrols to track down the Saviors but is soon captured. He is brought to a clearing along with Rick and several others of the group that has been captured by the Saviors, and they met the real Negan, who wields a baseball bat wrapped with barbed wired named \"Lucille\". Negan prepares to kill one of the group in retaliation for the attack on the Savior compound and force them to swear loyalty to him.\n\n===Season 7===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 7)}}\nAfter Negan chooses Abraham to kill, Daryl attacks him but he is held back by the Saviors. Negan proceeds to kill Glenn, and then convinces Rick to agree to his terms. Daryl is taken prisoner by Dwight back to Sanctuary, the Savior's base. Dwight attempts to convert him to join Negan, but Daryl refuses. Later, Sherry helps Daryl to escape, and he is helped to Hilltop by Jesus, where Rick and others are meeting to discuss the situation with Negan. After a tearful reunion, they all agree Daryl is a fugitive from Negan and Jesus suggest he go to the Kingdom run by King Ezekiel for safety as well as to try to convince Ezekiel to help. There, Ezekiel remains non-committed as his deal with Negan is amicable, but offers Daryl shelter.\n\nWhile there, one of Ezekiel's men, Richard, suggests a plan to lure Ezekiel into fighting the Saviors, by having the Savior kill a woman that Ekeziel has taken a liking to but staying outside of the Kingdom. Daryl realizes this is Carol, and refuses to go along with the plan. He opts to return to Hilltop, but stops to reunite with Carol on his way out. After debriefing the Hilltop community, he apologizes to Maggie for Glenn's death and she forgives him. Daryl then returns to Alexandria, and helped prepare for a plan to attack Negan the next time he comes. However, they find Dwight has arrived, who swears that he wants to help them stop Negan despite Daryl's reservations. Negan does launch a surprise attack on Alexandria, but the timely arrival of the Hilltop and Kingdom communities allow them to overpower the Saviors and their allies, the Scavengers, and the three communities agree to go to war against Negan. Daryl finds a note from Dwight swearing he did not know what Negan had planned.\n\n===Season 8===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 8)}}\nDaryl is first seen in the season premiere [[Mercy (The Walking Dead)|\"Mercy\"]], where he is key to their plan to attack the Sanctuary by luring a massive walker herd using placed explosives and his motorcycle. After their plan succeeds, he splits off with Rick to attack a compound housing Savior weaponry. [[Monsters (The Walking Dead)|\"Monsters\"]] shows Daryl and Rick searching the compound for the guns to no avail; unlike Rick, who is beginning to question their decision to go to war, Daryl has zero qualms about their mission, killing former Atlanta survivor Morales and executing a Savior who Rick promised mercy to. He is still distrusting of Dwight.\n\nWhen Rick and Daryl have a misunderstanding, their newly acquired weapons are accidentally set ablaze as they fight. After Dwight is later exposed as a mole, one Savior gets away after the rest are shot, and then Dwight asks to be spared. As he is led away, Daryl takes back his vest.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 10, 2017|title='Walking Dead' Recap: Tide of War Turns in Midseason Finale (SPOILERS)|author=Otterson, Joe|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/walking-dead-recap-season-8-midseason-finale-1202635498/}}</ref> Despite this, Daryl remains hostile to Dwight and expressly states his intention of killing him once the war is over. Though Tara initially agrees with him on this, she changes her mind after Dwight saves her life twice.\n\nIn the season finale, Daryl takes part in the final battle with the Saviors and survives. Afterwards, he drives Dwight out into the woods where Dwight expects Daryl to execute him. Instead, Daryl exiles Dwight on threat of death if he ever returns and encourages his former enemy to seek out his wife Sherry.\n\n===Season 9===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 9)}}\nEighteen months have passed since [[Wrath (The Walking Dead)|Rick defeated Negan]]. The communities of Alexandria, the Hilltop, the Kingdom, Oceanside, and the Sanctuary have rebuilt what they can to make more viable societies. Daryl and Eugene oversee the remaining Saviors at the Sanctuary, where infertile ground makes it difficult to grow anything. Justin, a Savior, tries to take more than his share and pushes Henry. Daryl rushes in to subdue Justin before Rick can assert his control on the group. Rick and Daryl realize the Saviors are starting to get out of hand, due to Rick's hurry to finish the bridge and the lack of food. Later, they set off the dynamite, and track the nearby walker horde as it diverts towards the first siren. However, when the second siren, manned by Justin, fails to sound, Rick realizes the group of men at a logging site nearby are in trouble. There, Daryl sees the horde and orders everyone to flee, but in the haste, Aaron's arm is crushed under a giant log.\n\n===Season 10===\n{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 10)}}\n{{Empty section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Weapons==\n\nDaryl used a Horton Scout HD 125 [[crossbow]] for the first three seasons. The character's use has inspired reviews of the weapon at [[Amazon.com]] referring to the show. It was replaced by a more powerful Stryker StrykeZone 380 during Season 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensfitness.com/life/entertainment/norman-reedus-the-walking-man|title=Norman Reedus: The Walking Man|author=Dean, Josh|publisher=Boys Fitness|accessdate=March 23, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011039/http://www.mensfitness.com/life/entertainment/norman-reedus-the-walking-man|archivedate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> In season 6 episode 9, Daryl uses an Airtronic RPG-7 to take out a biker gang working for Negan.

He was asked to come in and read lines. They picked Merle's lines, which is why the rumor still abounds that he read for the role of Merle, but Rooker already had the part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/walking-dead-audition-stories-815523/9-norman-reedus-daryl|title='The Walking Dead' Audition Tales: 31 Stars Tell All|website=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=9 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019011027/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/walking-dead-audition-stories-815523/9-norman-reedus-daryl|archivedate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-walking-dead-star-norman-reedus-got-cast-2015-10|title='The Walking Dead' star Norman Reedus almost didn't get cast \u2014 here's how being persistent got him a lead role|website=businessinsider.com|accessdate=9 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019003418/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-walking-dead-star-norman-reedus-got-cast-2015-10|archivedate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Designtrend.com|title='The Walking Dead' Star Norman Reedus On How He Actually Landed The Role Of Daryl Dixon|author=Saclao, Christian|date=October 9, 2015|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/62446/20151009/the-walking-dead-norman-reedus-how-he-actually-landed-the-role-of-daryl-dixon.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101161221/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/62446/20151009/the-walking-dead-norman-reedus-how-he-actually-landed-the-role-of-daryl-dixon.htm|archivedate=2017-01-01}}</ref> They liked his audition and gave him the role of Daryl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daryl Dixon Robert Kirkman's \"Favorite Element\" of TV Show|url=http://1337wiki.com/daryl-dixon-robert-kirkmans-favorite-element-of-tv-show/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923004606/http://1337wiki.com/daryl-dixon-robert-kirkmans-favorite-element-of-tv-show/|archivedate=2015-09-23|access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> Daryl was originally a recurring character but was upgraded to the main cast in season two.

Dela Cruz.\n\n==Patron Saint==\n\n===Saint Ferdinand of Castile===\n\nBorn near Salamanca, Spain, c. 1199; died in Seville, Spain, on May 30, 1252; canonized in 1671 at the request of Philip IV.\nFerdinand was the son of Alphonso IX, king of Le\u00f3n, and Berengaria, the oldest daughter of Alphonso III, king of Castile. His maternal grandmother was the daughter of Henry II of England, and her sister Blanche became the mother of Saint Louis of France. The death of Berengaria's brother, Henry, left her heiress to the throne of Castile in 1217, but she ceded her rights to the 18-year- old Ferdinand. He was a stern, but forgiving, ruler who ignored personal slights, and an excellent administrator. The archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Ximenes, was chancellor of Castile and his principal adviser for many years. Ferdinand married Beatrice, daughter of King Philip of Swabia in 1219.\nUpon the death of his father in 1230, Ferdinand became king of Le\u00f3n. There was opposition to this, for there were supporters of the claim of his two half sisters, but his union of the two kingdoms made a recovery from the Moors possible. He campaigned against the Moors without respite for 27 years, and his success won the great devotion of his people. He recaptured the greater part of Andalusia, including Ubeda, Cordova (1236), Murcia, Jaen, Cadiz, and Seville (1249).\n\nIt was in the battle of Xeres, when only 10 or 12 Spanish lives were lost, that Saint James (Santiago) was said to have been seen leading the host on a white horse. Saint James's chronicle is a principal source for Ferdinand's achievements. Ferdinand's military efforts were not so much imperialistic in motivation as driven by a wish to save Christians from the dominance of infidels. Although he was a warrior, it was said of him that \"he feared the curse of one old woman more than a whole army of Moors.\" In thanksgiving for his victories, Ferdinand rebuilt the cathedral in Burgos and converted the great mosque of Seville into a church. He restored to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostella the bells that had been removed by the Moors. Once the Moors and Jews submitted, he pursued a course of tolerance, while encouraging the friars to convert them. He was the founder of the famed University of Salamanca in 1243. He married Joan of Ponthieu on the death of Beatrice. By his second wife he was the father of Eleanor, wife of King Edward I of England. Upon his death he was buried in the habit of a Franciscan friar in the cathedral of Seville. At his death he was popularly acclaimed a saint but canonical recognition took another 400 years (Attwater, Benedictines, Delaney, White). King Saint Ferdinand is depicted in art as a crowned knight with a greyhound. He is dressed royal regalia, cross on his breast, and the dog at his feet (Roeder). He is the patron saint of persons in authority (rulers, governors, magistrates, etc.) --a result of  his  wise  appointments;  the poor and prisoners (over whom such persons rule); engineers (a result of his technical military skills), and the Spanish army (White)\n\n==History==\n\nSt. Ferdinand College was established in September 1950, based on Christian democratic principles dedicated to the original objectives of its original founders, the Knights of Columbus Ilagan Council 3705.\n\t \nWith the able services of dynamic and scientifically-oriented faculty and administrators, the College has offered a kind of education that prepares the student for life. It provides every student with moral and intellectual training in Christian atmosphere so that they may become efficient and ready to play a dynamic role in the growth of the country.\n \nThe College had its formal operation on the school year 1951-1952 and offered kindergarten up to college level. Started occupying three small and temporary buildings enough to accommodate complete elementary grades with only one section each; a complete secondary level with only seven sections; and a handful of college students enrolled in Liberal Arts and in Elementary Education.\n \nOn the first year of its existence the college was operated purely by lay teachers and administrators, but because its desire to propagate stronger and more firm Christian education the late Rev. Msgr. Ricardo A. Jamias, one of the founders and spiritual director invited the Franciscan Sisters to take over the reins of the College from 1952 up to S.Y 1974-1975.\n \nDuring the S.Y 1952-1953, the newly constructed main building was occupied. Permit was granted by the Bureau of Private Schools to open courses in Education and Commerce. Four years later, the College reaped the first crop of graduates in the college level. Full recognition of all courses offered was granted on its fourth and fifth year of operation.\n \nThe coming of the Fransican sisters under the very able and energetic direction of Sr. Agnes Encarnacion gave an impetous to its enrollment and from then on there was a yearly increase in each of the three departments. The major turning point of the College came as a result of the opening of a new course in education, the BSEEd. There was then a great demand of graduates finishing this course. The majority of the public school teachers were only ETC graduates. These undergraduates rushed to SFC to enroll which resulted in the dramatic increase in the population particularly in the College Department.\n \nThe greatest problem met as a result of the increase in enrolment was lack of class rooms. The main building, which was occupied by the three departments the library, the laboratories, and offices were not enough. The College had to look for means by which it could accommodate all the students. The school Board of Trustees decided to act and secured a loan for the construction of separate buildings for the elementary, secondary, and HE practice house. \n\nDuring the year 1962, the ROTC unit was activated which added more attraction to the male students. A separate ROTC and Armory building was immediately constructed for that purpose. The succeeding years, new major fields of learning was opened: Accounting, Banking and Finance, and Management in Commerce; English, Mathematics, History, Science and Filipino under Education. This led to the establishment of a separate College of Arts and Sciences, and College of Commerce and Secretarial.\n \nIn 1965, the Graduate Course (the First throughout the valley) was opened. This led to the expansion of the library with the purchase of hundreds of volumes of books to meet the requirements arising from the increase in student enrollment.\n \nBeing fully recognized by the government, all the schools graduate and post graduate offerings are now well-established and has graduated many MA's, MBA's and MPA's since. In 1993, Ph.D. course was opened. The pioneer batch from this post graduate courase graduated in the SY 1995-1996.\n \nThe School of Midwifery was established in 1986. Its first batch of graduates include a topnotcher in the Board Exams. The Voc. Tech School was also put up in the year 1987 but it was closed years after because of dwindling population.\n\nThe decade of the 90's has witnessed significant changes which have been taking place in the College. Under permit 002 granted by the DECS, the School started to offer Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) in the S.Y. 1992-1993. Again the School was in the national limelight when a BSN graduate Batch '98 was one of the topnotchers in the Nursing Licensure Examination. It was during the S.Y. 1993-1994 when the following courses was opened: Bachelor of Science in Management-major in Legal Management (which was also closed for some reasons other than poor enrolment); Two Year Medical Secretarial Course. The school opened Bachelor of Science in Criminology course during S.Y. 1994-95 and it had been under the headship of the Dean of the AB Department.\n \nBecause of the massive transfer of students to SFC, the Msgr. Ricardo Jamias Bldg. which houses the administrative offices, libraries and classrooms of the College of Education and College of Arts and Sciences underwent massive face-lifting while the Our Lady of Lourdes Bldg. underwent finishing touches. A year earlier, the  Our Lady of Visitation building was constructed to provide adequate and comfortable rooms for the secondary students. In the year 1997, the Our Lady of Perpetual Help building was completed to meet the growing demands of elementary graders. Also, a multi-purpose laboratory was opened for the High School and Elementary for their Home Technology, food processing, textile and sewing and handicraft making practicum. A fourth floor has been added to the Lourdes building and a 500-seater auditorium complete with  sound and stage lighting system was constructed. The hall was named Arranz Auditorium in honor to the late Judge Manual Arranz and Mrs. Magdalena Arranz, the school's first directress. The old seminary building across Mabini St. had been leased by the school for the paramedical courses. The building has been completely rehabilitated and its laboratories were completely furnished. Due to the increasing population the school had likewise leased the old rectory and had been converted into classrooms for the college department.\n \nTwo separate colleges under the supervision of their own deans were established, the College of Accountancy and College of Criminology in the S.Y. 1996-97. During that school year, new courses were offered namely, BS Biology and BS Nutrition and Dietetics. These however, were closed two years after because of poor enrollment. The school envisions to open more courses in the next school year 1999-2000.

Dela Cruz.\n\n==Patron Saint==\n\n===Saint Ferdinand of Castile===\n\nBorn near Salamanca, Spain, c. 1199; died in Seville, Spain, on May 30, 1252; canonized in 1671 at the request of Philip IV.\nFerdinand was the son of Alphonso IX, king of Le\u00f3n, and Berengaria, the oldest daughter of Alphonso III, king of Castile. His maternal grandmother was the daughter of Henry II of England, and her sister Blanche became the mother of Saint Louis of France. The death of Berengaria's brother, Henry, left her heiress to the throne of Castile in 1217, but she ceded her rights to the 18-year- old Ferdinand. He was a stern, but forgiving, ruler who ignored personal slights, and an excellent administrator. The archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Ximenes, was chancellor of Castile and his principal adviser for many years. Ferdinand married Beatrice, daughter of King Philip of Swabia in 1219.\nUpon the death of his father in 1230, Ferdinand became king of Le\u00f3n. There was opposition to this, for there were supporters of the claim of his two half sisters, but his union of the two kingdoms made a recovery from the Moors possible. He campaigned against the Moors without respite for 27 years, and his success won the great devotion of his people. He recaptured the greater part of Andalusia, including Ubeda, Cordova (1236), Murcia, Jaen, Cadiz, and Seville (1249).\n\nIt was in the battle of Xeres, when only 10 or 12 Spanish lives were lost, that Saint James (Santiago) was said to have been seen leading the host on a white horse. Saint James's chronicle is a principal source for Ferdinand's achievements. Ferdinand's military efforts were not so much imperialistic in motivation as driven by a wish to save Christians from the dominance of infidels. Although he was a warrior, it was said of him that \"he feared the curse of one old woman more than a whole army of Moors.\" In thanksgiving for his victories, Ferdinand rebuilt the cathedral in Burgos and converted the great mosque of Seville into a church. He restored to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostella the bells that had been removed by the Moors. Once the Moors and Jews submitted, he pursued a course of tolerance, while encouraging the friars to convert them. He was the founder of the famed University of Salamanca in 1243. He married Joan of Ponthieu on the death of Beatrice. By his second wife he was the father of Eleanor, wife of King Edward I of England. Upon his death he was buried in the habit of a Franciscan friar in the cathedral of Seville. At his death he was popularly acclaimed a saint but canonical recognition took another 400 years (Attwater, Benedictines, Delaney, White). King Saint Ferdinand is depicted in art as a crowned knight with a greyhound. He is dressed royal regalia, cross on his breast, and the dog at his feet (Roeder). He is the patron saint of persons in authority (rulers, governors, magistrates, etc.) --a result of  his  wise  appointments;  the poor and prisoners (over whom such persons rule); engineers (a result of his technical military skills), and the Spanish army (White)\n\n==History==\n\nSt. Ferdinand College was established in September 1950, based on Christian democratic principles dedicated to the original objectives of its original founders, the Knights of Columbus Ilagan Council 3705.\n\t \nWith the able services of dynamic and scientifically-oriented faculty and administrators, the College has offered a kind of education that prepares the student for life. It provides every student with moral and intellectual training in Christian atmosphere so that they may become efficient and ready to play a dynamic role in the growth of the country.\n \nThe College had its formal operation on the school year 1951-1952 and offered kindergarten up to college level. Started occupying three small and temporary buildings enough to accommodate complete elementary grades with only one section each; a complete secondary level with only seven sections; and a handful of college students enrolled in Liberal Arts and in Elementary Education.\n \nOn the first year of its existence the college was operated purely by lay teachers and administrators, but because its desire to propagate stronger and more firm Christian education the late Rev. Msgr. Ricardo A. Jamias, one of the founders and spiritual director invited the Franciscan Sisters to take over the reins of the College from 1952 up to S.Y 1974-1975.\n \nDuring the S.Y 1952-1953, the newly constructed main building was occupied. Permit was granted by the Bureau of Private Schools to open courses in Education and Commerce. Four years later, the College reaped the first crop of graduates in the college level. Full recognition of all courses offered was granted on its fourth and fifth year of operation.\n \nThe coming of the Fransican sisters under the very able and energetic direction of Sr. Agnes Encarnacion gave an impetous to its enrollment and from then on there was a yearly increase in each of the three departments. The major turning point of the College came as a result of the opening of a new course in education, the BSEEd. There was then a great demand of graduates finishing this course. The majority of the public school teachers were only ETC graduates. These undergraduates rushed to SFC to enroll which resulted in the dramatic increase in the population particularly in the College Department.\n \nThe greatest problem met as a result of the increase in enrolment was lack of class rooms. The main building, which was occupied by the three departments the library, the laboratories, and offices were not enough. The College had to look for means by which it could accommodate all the students. The school Board of Trustees decided to act and secured a loan for the construction of separate buildings for the elementary, secondary, and HE practice house. \n\nDuring the year 1962, the ROTC unit was activated which added more attraction to the male students. A separate ROTC and Armory building was immediately constructed for that purpose. The succeeding years, new major fields of learning was opened: Accounting, Banking and Finance, and Management in Commerce; English, Mathematics, History, Science and Filipino under Education. This led to the establishment of a separate College of Arts and Sciences, and College of Commerce and Secretarial.\n \nIn 1965, the Graduate Course (the First throughout the valley) was opened. This led to the expansion of the library with the purchase of hundreds of volumes of books to meet the requirements arising from the increase in student enrollment.\n \nBeing fully recognized by the government, all the schools graduate and post graduate offerings are now well-established and has graduated many MA's, MBA's and MPA's since. In 1993, Ph.D. course was opened. The pioneer batch from this post graduate courase graduated in the SY 1995-1996.\n \nThe School of Midwifery was established in 1986. Its first batch of graduates include a topnotcher in the Board Exams. The Voc. Tech School was also put up in the year 1987 but it was closed years after because of dwindling population.\n\nThe decade of the 90's has witnessed significant changes which have been taking place in the College. Under permit 002 granted by the DECS, the School started to offer Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) in the S.Y. 1992-1993. Again the School was in the national limelight when a BSN graduate Batch '98 was one of the topnotchers in the Nursing Licensure Examination. It was during the S.Y. 1993-1994 when the following courses was opened: Bachelor of Science in Management-major in Legal Management (which was also closed for some reasons other than poor enrolment); Two Year Medical Secretarial Course. The school opened Bachelor of Science in Criminology course during S.Y. 1994-95 and it had been under the headship of the Dean of the AB Department.\n \nBecause of the massive transfer of students to SFC, the Msgr. Ricardo Jamias Bldg. which houses the administrative offices, libraries and classrooms of the College of Education and College of Arts and Sciences underwent massive face-lifting while the Our Lady of Lourdes Bldg. underwent finishing touches. A year earlier, the  Our Lady of Visitation building was constructed to provide adequate and comfortable rooms for the secondary students. In the year 1997, the Our Lady of Perpetual Help building was completed to meet the growing demands of elementary graders. Also, a multi-purpose laboratory was opened for the High School and Elementary for their Home Technology, food processing, textile and sewing and handicraft making practicum. A fourth floor has been added to the Lourdes building and a 500-seater auditorium complete with  sound and stage lighting system was constructed. The hall was named Arranz Auditorium in honor to the late Judge Manual Arranz and Mrs. Magdalena Arranz, the school's first directress. The old seminary building across Mabini St. had been leased by the school for the paramedical courses. The building has been completely rehabilitated and its laboratories were completely furnished. Due to the increasing population the school had likewise leased the old rectory and had been converted into classrooms for the college department.\n \nTwo separate colleges under the supervision of their own deans were established, the College of Accountancy and College of Criminology in the S.Y. 1996-97. During that school year, new courses were offered namely, BS Biology and BS Nutrition and Dietetics. These however, were closed two years after because of poor enrollment.

It was formed from the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s [[World War II]] bomber squadron, [[No. 75 Squadron RAF|No. 75 Squadron]], which had been initially equipped by the New Zealand government and was largely manned by New Zealanders. The squadron was created when, in a unique gesture, the squadron number, colours and battle honours were transferred to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]] in 1946. It had flown more sorties and suffered more casualties than any other in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]].\n\nThe squadron ceased to exist on 13 December 2001, when the RNZAF Air Combat Force, comprising Nos 2, 14, and 75 Squadrons, was officially disbanded.\n\n==History==\n\n===No. 75 RFC / RAF History===\n[[No. 75 Squadron RAF|No. 75 Squadron Royal Flying Corps]] (later [[RAF]]) was formed as a home defence [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] unit  on 1 October 1916  but disbanded in June 1919 following the end of [[World War I]]. The squadron reformed at [[RAF Feltwell]] in [[Norfolk]] on 15 March 1937 as part of the RAF expansion in the mid-1930s, with transfer of pilots from [[No. 215 Squadron RAF]], being equipped with four [[Vickers Virginia]]s and seven [[Avro Anson]]s for bomber training.  The squadron later operated [[Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow|Handley Page Harrow]]s which were replaced by  Ansons in 1939, operating again in a training role alongside No 15 Operational Training Unit. Meanwhile, the New Zealand government had ordered 30 modern [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers to replace its [[Vickers Vildebeest]]s in New Zealand. Aircrew were sent to England to train on these new aircraft before flying them back to New Zealand.\n\n===75 (NZ) Squadron===\n[[File:75 Squadron RMZAF Short Stirling AA-C en route for 26th mission.JPG|thumb|[[Short Stirling]] AA-C]]\nIn August 1939, with war seeming increasingly likely, the New Zealand government offered to place both men and machines at the disposal of Britain.  They were allocated the \"75\" squadron number and the squadron officially became No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, RAF on 4 April 1940. It was one of the first of the \"bracket\" squadrons. Ultimately, six other New Zealand units, as well as many from other countries,  were formed within the RAF, until the practice ceased in 1942.  These squadrons were usually formed around aircrews from the named nation, replacement aircrew where possible coming from that nation as well, although most ground crew were British.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Main|No. 75 Squadron RAF}}\nThe squadron was progressively equipped with Wellingtons, [[Short Stirling]]s, [[Avro Lancaster]]s and finally [[Avro Lincoln]]s, which it was preparing to take to the Far East as part of [[Tiger Force (air)|Tiger Force]] when Japan surrendered. Some have claimed that No 75 Squadron it to be the only squadron engaged constantly against Germany from 1939 to VE day. However, as the 75 (NZ) Sqn only stood up in April 1940, this is not correct.  \nIt flew more sorties than any other RAF heavy bomber unit, suffered more casualties than any other squadron, and dropped the second-largest weight of bombs. A pilot of the Squadron was awarded a VC in 1941, Sergeant [[James Allen Ward]] climbed along the wing of a Wellington in flight, in an attempt to extinguish a fire from an engine after a night fighter attack.\n\nNo 75(NZ) Squadron RAF saw action early over France, Norway and most other European nations, but principally against Germany.  The squadron was part of the first major bombing raid on Germany, a night raid on oil infrastructure in the Ruhr on 15 May 1940. In September that year the squadron took part in the first large-scale  bombing of Berlin.\n\nIn March 1944, No. 75(NZ) Sqn began to exchange its Stirlings for Lancaster III's and was ready in time to participate in preparation and support of the Allied invasion, the bombing of flying-bomb sites and close-support of the armies. A Lancaster, (ND917), a Mark III captained by Squadron Leader N A Williamson, RNZAF, on 30 June 1944 became the first British heavy bomber to land in Normandy after the invasion began. The Lancaster was returning from an attack on Villers Bocage in support of the Army when Williamson landed on one of the newly laid landing strips on the beach-head to seek medical aid for his flight engineer who had been wounded by flak.\n\nAn unusual sortie for 75(NZ) Squadron was the high altitude run over [[The Hague]] in March 1945 by a lone Lancaster piloted by Flight Lieutenant H W Hooper. He dropped thousands of leaflets containing an apology from the British government for the earlier [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of the city which had been an error.[[File:TA4K Skyhawk at Whenuapai.JPG|thumb|right|TA-4K at [[Whenuapai]] in the late 1980s]]\n\n===75 Squadron RNZAF===\nIn recognition of their wartime record, in October 1946 the RAF officially handed over the 75 Squadron title and badge to the RNZAF.  This is the only occasion that the RAF has \u201cgifted\u201d a Squadron title and badge to another Commonwealth Air Force and is a tribute to the sacrifices and contribution made by all New Zealanders in the RAF during World War II.\n\nThe post-World War II squadron reformed at [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]] from [[No. 2 Squadron RNZAF]]. It was initially equipped with twin-engine [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter/bombers. In 1950 and 1952 the squadron's Mosquito's sank two ships (for target practice), the barque ''Lutterworth'' with bombs in 1950 and the ''[[Arahura (twin screw ship)|Arahura]]'' with rockets in 1952.<ref>Evening Post, Wellington, 25 January 1952</ref> The unit operated [[de Havilland Vampire]]s from 1951 to 1970 out of [[Ohakea]].\n\nIn February 1958 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] presented No 75 Squadron with its Squadron Standard, the squadron having earned the Sovereign's appreciation for outstanding service.  Fourteen Battle Honours were awarded, eight of which are depicted on the Standard.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962 the squadron operated nine [[English Electric Canberra]]s, on loan from the RAF, out of [[Tengah Airbase|RAF Tengah]], [[Singapore]].  They were used on anti-terrorist operations during the [[Malayan Emergency]].\n[[File:TA-4K CrowValley 1984.jpg|thumb|No. 75 Sqn. TA-4K in 1984 during Exercise Cope Thunder]]\nIn 1970 14 [[McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]s were purchased to replace the Vampire FB5's of 75 Sqn \u2013 which was the primary attack squadron for the RNZAF. Ten were single-seat A-4Ks, and four twin-seat TA-4Ks. Early in their life all of the aircraft were modified with cranked refuelling probes. In 1984, the NZ Government bought another 10 A-4s from the Australian Navy, and in 1988\u201389, the Skyhawk fleet underwent [[Project KAHU]] which upgraded the [[avionics]] systems. The squadron's former [[Royal Australian Navy]] A-4G aircraft were then re-designated A-4K/TA-4K. In 1994 a major escape system change was initiated to fit the UPCO SIII3S-ER ejection seat to replace the MDD EScapac1G3.  However, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] under [[Jenny Shipley]] then decided to replace the [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s with 28 [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] Block 15 surplus aircraft from the USA in 1998.  But the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]] under [[Helen Clark]] in 1999 with totally different military views decided to remove all attack aircraft from the RNZAF, and the Skyhawks were removed from service and the squadron disbanded in December 2001.\n\n[[File:F16A FAP linksup KC-10.jpg|thumb|A F-16A outfitted with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, 75 Squadron RNZAF was due to acquire the type in 2001 before being disbanded.|alt=Aircraft carrying missiles on tips of wings during flight over ocean.

The disbandment day parade marched the three squadron standards to the Base Ohakea chapel of St Mark and were laid up there to hang from the rafters, until such time as the squadron/s are reinstated.\n\nA political group of concerned civilians and ex-serviceman, called \"Save Our Squadrons (SOS)\" was formed to protest the move, and took high court action in an attempt to prevent its loss.  The court action was not successful. The [[New Zealand National Party]] at the time had promised to re-establish an air combat force if it was re-elected, however in later years statements from their defence spokesperson suggested the cost to do so might be prohibitive.  In November 2008, the Labour Government was defeated by the National Party led by John Key.  Reinstatement of the air combat capability is very unlikely, although it has been discussed in the media from time to time.\n\nIn 2011 eight former RNZAF A-4K and TA-4K Skyhawks were sold to [[Draken International]]. The Skyhawks are preserved in their RNZAF colour schemes and are used as an adversary squadron against [[USAF]] and [[US Navy]] fighter aircraft. Draken International also bought 8 former RNZAF [[Aermacchi MB-339]] training jets.\n\n\n[[File:Draken International .jpg|thumb|Draken International team with former RNZAF A-4K Skyhawks]]\n\n==Media==\nA Squadron History by [[Norman Franks]] was published in 1991, titled ''Forever Strong'' (a translation of the squadron's Maori motto, ''Ake Ake Kia Kaha'').  A pictorial history of the final days of 2, 14 and 75 Squadron has been published, as has a children's book about a Skyhawk serving with the squadron.

It was formed from the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s [[World War II]] bomber squadron, [[No. 75 Squadron RAF|No. 75 Squadron]], which had been initially equipped by the New Zealand government and was largely manned by New Zealanders. The squadron was created when, in a unique gesture, the squadron number, colours and battle honours were transferred to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]] in 1946. It had flown more sorties and suffered more casualties than any other in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]].\n\nThe squadron ceased to exist on 13 December 2001, when the RNZAF Air Combat Force, comprising Nos 2, 14, and 75 Squadrons, was officially disbanded.\n\n==History==\n\n===No. 75 RFC / RAF History===\n[[No. 75 Squadron RAF|No. 75 Squadron Royal Flying Corps]] (later [[RAF]]) was formed as a home defence [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] unit  on 1 October 1916  but disbanded in June 1919 following the end of [[World War I]]. The squadron reformed at [[RAF Feltwell]] in [[Norfolk]] on 15 March 1937 as part of the RAF expansion in the mid-1930s, with transfer of pilots from [[No. 215 Squadron RAF]], being equipped with four [[Vickers Virginia]]s and seven [[Avro Anson]]s for bomber training.  The squadron later operated [[Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow|Handley Page Harrow]]s which were replaced by  Ansons in 1939, operating again in a training role alongside No 15 Operational Training Unit. Meanwhile, the New Zealand government had ordered 30 modern [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers to replace its [[Vickers Vildebeest]]s in New Zealand. Aircrew were sent to England to train on these new aircraft before flying them back to New Zealand.\n\n===75 (NZ) Squadron===\n[[File:75 Squadron RMZAF Short Stirling AA-C en route for 26th mission.JPG|thumb|[[Short Stirling]] AA-C]]\nIn August 1939, with war seeming increasingly likely, the New Zealand government offered to place both men and machines at the disposal of Britain.  They were allocated the \"75\" squadron number and the squadron officially became No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, RAF on 4 April 1940. It was one of the first of the \"bracket\" squadrons. Ultimately, six other New Zealand units, as well as many from other countries,  were formed within the RAF, until the practice ceased in 1942.  These squadrons were usually formed around aircrews from the named nation, replacement aircrew where possible coming from that nation as well, although most ground crew were British.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Main|No. 75 Squadron RAF}}\nThe squadron was progressively equipped with Wellingtons, [[Short Stirling]]s, [[Avro Lancaster]]s and finally [[Avro Lincoln]]s, which it was preparing to take to the Far East as part of [[Tiger Force (air)|Tiger Force]] when Japan surrendered. Some have claimed that No 75 Squadron it to be the only squadron engaged constantly against Germany from 1939 to VE day. However, as the 75 (NZ) Sqn only stood up in April 1940, this is not correct.  \nIt flew more sorties than any other RAF heavy bomber unit, suffered more casualties than any other squadron, and dropped the second-largest weight of bombs. A pilot of the Squadron was awarded a VC in 1941, Sergeant [[James Allen Ward]] climbed along the wing of a Wellington in flight, in an attempt to extinguish a fire from an engine after a night fighter attack.\n\nNo 75(NZ) Squadron RAF saw action early over France, Norway and most other European nations, but principally against Germany.  The squadron was part of the first major bombing raid on Germany, a night raid on oil infrastructure in the Ruhr on 15 May 1940. In September that year the squadron took part in the first large-scale  bombing of Berlin.\n\nIn March 1944, No. 75(NZ) Sqn began to exchange its Stirlings for Lancaster III's and was ready in time to participate in preparation and support of the Allied invasion, the bombing of flying-bomb sites and close-support of the armies. A Lancaster, (ND917), a Mark III captained by Squadron Leader N A Williamson, RNZAF, on 30 June 1944 became the first British heavy bomber to land in Normandy after the invasion began. The Lancaster was returning from an attack on Villers Bocage in support of the Army when Williamson landed on one of the newly laid landing strips on the beach-head to seek medical aid for his flight engineer who had been wounded by flak.\n\nAn unusual sortie for 75(NZ) Squadron was the high altitude run over [[The Hague]] in March 1945 by a lone Lancaster piloted by Flight Lieutenant H W Hooper. He dropped thousands of leaflets containing an apology from the British government for the earlier [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of the city which had been an error.[[File:TA4K Skyhawk at Whenuapai.JPG|thumb|right|TA-4K at [[Whenuapai]] in the late 1980s]]\n\n===75 Squadron RNZAF===\nIn recognition of their wartime record, in October 1946 the RAF officially handed over the 75 Squadron title and badge to the RNZAF.  This is the only occasion that the RAF has \u201cgifted\u201d a Squadron title and badge to another Commonwealth Air Force and is a tribute to the sacrifices and contribution made by all New Zealanders in the RAF during World War II.\n\nThe post-World War II squadron reformed at [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]] from [[No. 2 Squadron RNZAF]]. It was initially equipped with twin-engine [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter/bombers. In 1950 and 1952 the squadron's Mosquito's sank two ships (for target practice), the barque ''Lutterworth'' with bombs in 1950 and the ''[[Arahura (twin screw ship)|Arahura]]'' with rockets in 1952.<ref>Evening Post, Wellington, 25 January 1952</ref> The unit operated [[de Havilland Vampire]]s from 1951 to 1970 out of [[Ohakea]].\n\nIn February 1958 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] presented No 75 Squadron with its Squadron Standard, the squadron having earned the Sovereign's appreciation for outstanding service.  Fourteen Battle Honours were awarded, eight of which are depicted on the Standard.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962 the squadron operated nine [[English Electric Canberra]]s, on loan from the RAF, out of [[Tengah Airbase|RAF Tengah]], [[Singapore]].  They were used on anti-terrorist operations during the [[Malayan Emergency]].\n[[File:TA-4K CrowValley 1984.jpg|thumb|No. 75 Sqn.

Agricultural University Gymnasium]].\n\nThis [[freestyle wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[China

It is an example of [[Twin cities|twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity]]. Minnesotans living outside of Minneapolis and Saint Paul often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as \"the cities.\"\n\nThere are several different definitions of the region. Many refer to the ''Twin Cities'' as the seven-county region which is governed under the [[Metropolitan Council]] regional governmental agency and planning organization. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] officially designates 16 counties as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013Bloomington MN\u2013WI Metropolitan Statistical Area\", the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|16th largest]] in the [[United States]]. The entire region known as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area\", has a population of 4,014,593, the [[Combined Statistical Area|14th largest]], according to 2018 Census estimates.\n\nDespite the Twin moniker, both cities are independent municipalities with defined borders. Minneapolis is somewhat younger with more modern skyscrapers downtown, while Saint Paul has been likened to an [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]] city, with quaint neighborhoods and a vast collection of well-preserved late-[[Victorian architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/stpaul |title=St. Paul travel guide<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232949/http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/stpaul |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status = dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nMinneapolis was influenced by its early [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Lutheran]] heritage, while Saint Paul was influenced by its early [[French Canadian|French]], [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|German]] [[Catholic]] roots.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Minnesota|History of Wisconsin}}\n[[File:Stillwater-2004-01-02.jpg|thumb|[[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]], [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]]]]\nThe first European settlement in the region was near what is now known as the town of [[Stillwater, Minnesota]]. The city is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} from downtown Saint Paul and lies on the western bank of the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]], which forms the border of central Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that began fueling early interest in the area was the outpost at [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]], which was constructed from 1820 to 1825 at the [[confluence]] of the [[Minnesota River]] and the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/military-history/expansionist-era |title=The Expansionist Era (1805\u20131858) |website=Minnesota Historical Society |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFort Snelling held jurisdiction over the land south of [[Saint Anthony Falls]], thus a town known as Saint Anthony grew just north of the river. For several years, the only European resident to live on the south bank of the river was Colonel [[John H. Stevens]], who operated a [[ferry]] service across the river. As soon as the land area controlled by Fort Snelling was reduced, new settlers began flocking across to the new village of Minneapolis. The town grew quickly, and Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merged.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Minneapolis |website=Minneapolis Public Library |year=2001 |url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh4.asp |access-date=2 May 2019 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104133936/http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh4.asp |archive-date=4 January 2009}}</ref> On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig's Eye and Lambert's Landing developed and would soon grow to become Saint Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitsaintpaul.com/blog/an-early-history-of-saint-paul/ |title=An Early History |website=Visit Saint Paul |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stpaul001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], showing barges on the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Minnesota State Capitol|Capitol dome]], and [[Minneapolis]]'s skyline in the far background (right of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]). In the lower right is a typical nineteenth century home. Taken from [[Indian Mounds Park (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Indian Mounds Park]].]]\nNatural geography played a role in the settlement and development of the two cities. The [[Mississippi River Valley]] in this area is defined by a series of stone bluffs that line both sides of the river. Saint Paul grew up around Lambert's Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an easily accessible point, some seven miles (11&nbsp;km) downstream from [[Saint Anthony Falls]], the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense water power for industry, defined the location of Minneapolis and its prominence as the Mill City. The falls can be seen today from the [[Mill City Museum]], housed in the former [[Washburn \"A\" Mill]], which was among the world's largest mills in its time.\n\nThe oldest farms in the state are located in Washington County, the eastern most county on the Minnesota side of the metropolitan area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota's first farmer, harvesting the first crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading Post Trail.<ref>{{cite book |title=Afton Remembered |first=Edwin G. |last=Robb |year=1996 |publisher=Afton Historical Society Press |isbn=978-0-9639338-7-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Afton_Remembered.html?id=iuRhAAAACAAJ }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ford lock and dam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River]] just upstream of the [[Minnesota River]]]]\nThe [[Grand Excursion]], a trip into the Upper [[Midwest]] sponsored by the [[Rock Island Railroad]], brought more than a thousand curious travelers into the area by [[railroad|rail]] and [[steamboat]] in 1854. The next year, in 1855, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', an [[epic poem]] based on the [[Ojibwe]] legends of [[Hiawatha]]. A number of natural area landmarks were included in the story, such as [[Lake Minnetonka]] and [[Minnehaha Falls]]. [[Tourism|Tourists]] inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and those who read Longfellow's story flocked to the area in the following decades.\n\nAt one time, the region also had numerous passenger rail services, including both interurban [[streetcar]] systems and interstate rail. Due to the width of the river at points further south, the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed by [[railroad]]. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul had long been at the [[head of navigation]] on the river, prior to a new [[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River|lock and dam facility]] being added upriver in Minneapolis.\n\nPassenger travel hit its peak in 1888 with nearly eight million traversing to and from the [[Saint Paul Union Depot]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} This amounted to approximately 150 trains daily. Before long, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies to combat the rise of the [[automobile]], some of the earliest [[streamliner]]s ran from [[Chicago]] to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant points in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Today, the only vestige of this interstate service comes by [[Amtrak]]'s [[King Street Station|Seattle]]/[[Portland Union Station|Portland]] to [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]] ''[[Empire Builder]]'' route, running once daily in each direction. It is named after [[James J. Hill]], a railroad [[tycoon]] who settled on [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]] in Saint Paul at what is now known as the [[James J. Hill House]].\n\nLike many Northern cities that grew up with the [[Industrial Revolution]], Minneapolis and St. Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 60s and 70s came population decline in the [[Demographics of Minneapolis|central city areas]], [[white flight]] to suburbs,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=It Couldn't Happen Here... |title=Metropolitics : a regional agenda for community and stability |first=Myron, Jr. |last=Orfield |isbn=0-8157-6640-8 |location=Washington DC |publisher=Brookings Institution |year=1997 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/metropoliticsreg00orfi/page/n20 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/metropoliticsreg00orfi }}</ref> and, in the summer of 1967, [[race riots]] on Minneapolis's North Side.<ref>{{cite news |last=Neset |first=Ray |title=Plymouth Avenue 40 Years Later |date=July 20, 2007 |url=http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=128&Itemid=1 |url-status = dead|newspaper=Minneapolis Mirror |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109122142/http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=128&Itemid=1 |archive-date=9 January 2009 |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and Saint Paul were frequently cited as former [[Rust Belt]] cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A Tale of Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul |last1=Abercrombie |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Griffiths |first2=Annie |magazine=National Geographic |date=November 1980 |volume=156 |number=5 |pages=664\u2013691 }}</ref>\n\n==Populated places==\n===Counties===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, or The Cities, includes 16 counties, of which 14 are in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin.

Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole.

It hosts both a [[KSJN|classical station]] and a contemporary station, [[KCMP|The Current]], which plays music from regional and other contemporary artists. The [[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]] program ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', hosted by Minnesota native [[Garrison Keillor]] aired live for many years from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. The show ended its run in 2016, with its successor ''[[Live from Here]]'' also airing from the same venue. This radio program was the basis of the 2006 film of the same name, [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]].\n\n[[KCMP|The Current]] and [[Walker Art Center|The Walker Art Center]] also host an annual music festival [[Rock the Garden]], which features nationally recognized and local artists.

Minneapolis is home to the famous [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]]. First Avenue is known for being the starting venue for many famous artists and bands that have come from the area including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], [[Manny Phesto]] and others.

Organized recreation includes the [[Great River Energy bicycle festival]], the [[Twin Cities Marathon]], and the U.S. [[pond hockey]] championships. Some studies have shown that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, [[medicine]] is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], as the [[University of Minnesota]] has joined other [[college]]s and [[hospital]]s in doing significant research, and major [[medical device]] manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is [[Medtronic]]). Technical innovators have brought important advances in [[computing]], including the [[Cray]] line of [[supercomputers]].\n\nIt is common for residents of the Twin Cities area to own or share [[cabin (housing)|cabin]]s and other properties along lakes and [[forest]]ed areas in the central and northern regions of the state, and weekend trips \"up North\" happen through the warmer months. [[Ice fishing]] is also a major pastime in the winter, although each year some overambitious [[fishing|fishermen]] find themselves in dangerous situations when they venture out onto the [[ice]] too early or too late. [[Hunting]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV riding]] and numerous other outdoor activities are also popular.

The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington as well as the Orthodox Church in America.\n\nThe headquarters of the former [[American Lutheran Church]] [[American Lutheran Church|(ALC)]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Lutheran Free Church]] and the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]] were located in Minneapolis; the headquarters of [[Augsburg Fortress]] publishing house still is. The [[Minneapolis Area Synod]] and the [[Saint Paul Area Synod]] are the first and third largest synods of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]]), respectively.\n\nThe [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] has its headquarters in Bloomington, and the [[Association of Free Lutheran Congregations]] is headquartered in Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School.\n\nThe Twin Cities are home to several [[synagogue]]s serving the [[Judaism|Jewish]] population, which is concentrated in the western Minneapolis suburbs of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park, Plymouth and Minnetonka. There is also a Hindu temple located in the Twin Cities suburb of [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]]. A recent influx of immigrants from [[Laos]] and [[North Africa|Northern Africa]] has brought many more religions to the area. There are several [[Islam]]ic [[Masjid]]s in the area. There is a temple for the religion of [[Eckankar]] in the suburb of [[Chanhassen]] known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhist]] peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS [[St. Paul Minnesota Temple]] opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are several very strong [[Unitarian Universalist]] communities such as the [[First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis|First Unitarian Society]] of Minneapolis, as well as several [[Paganism|Pagan]] and [[Buddhist]] groups.

The land of the area sits on top of thick layers of [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural [[cave]]s to develop, which were expanded into [[mining|mine]]s when white settlers came to the area. In the time of [[Prohibition]], at least one [[speakeasy]] was built into these hidden spaces\u2014eventually refurbished as the [[Wabasha Street Caves]] in Saint Paul.\n\nLakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of [[glacier]]s. This left many bodies of water in the region, and unusual shapes may appear. For example, [[Lake Minnetonka]] out toward the western side of the Twin Cities consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations in the metropolitan area range from {{convert|1376|ft|m|0}} above sea level in the northwest metro to {{convert|666|ft|m|0}} at the edge of the [[Mississippi River]] in the southeast.\n\n[[File:Bald Eagle-Burnsville-2006-01-15.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bald eagle]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]]]]\nBecause it is comparatively easy to dig through limestone and there are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area should examine the idea of building [[rapid transit|subway]]s for public transportation.

That structure is long gone, but a series of [[Hennepin Avenue Bridge]]s have been built since then at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as [[skyway]]s.\n\n[[File:Guthrie-North.jpg|thumb|[[Guthrie Theater]] on the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]\nSeveral prominent buildings in Minneapolis have helped modernize the city. These include the [[Walker Art Center]], [[Minneapolis Public Library|Central Public Library]], [[Weisman Art Museum]] and the [[Guthrie Theater]]. Opening in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double in size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts organization and as a national leader for its innovative approaches to audience engagement. The Guthrie received a large amount of media coverage for its opening in June 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The design is the work of architect Jean Nouvel and is a {{convert|285000|sqft|m2}} facility that houses three theaters: the theater's signature thrust stage, seating 1,100; a 700-seat proscenium stage; and a black-box studio with flexible seating. In 2002, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] put the old Guthrie building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the United States in response to plans announced by the Walker Art Center to expand on the land occupied by the theater. However, the original Guthrie building was torn down in 2006. These building projects have rejuvenated the downtown area.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Colleges and universities==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Adler Graduate School]] \u2013 Richfield\n* [[Anoka-Ramsey Community College]] \u2013 Coon Rapids and Cambridge\n* [[Anoka Technical College]] \u2013 Anoka\n* [[Augsburg University]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[Bethel University (Minnesota)|Bethel University]] \u2013 Arden Hills\n* [[Capella University]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[Century College]] \u2013 White Bear Lake\n* [[Concordia University (St. Paul)|Concordia University]] \u2013 Saint Paul\n* [[Crown College (Minnesota)|Crown College]] \u2013 St. Bonifacius\n* [[Dakota County Technical College]] \u2013 Rosemount\n* [[Dunwoody College of Technology]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[Hamline University]] \u2013 Saint Paul\n* [[Hennepin Technical College]] \u2013 Eden Prairie and Brooklyn Park\n* [[Inver Hills Community College]] \u2013 Inver Grove Heights\n* [[Luther Seminary]] \u2013 Saint Paul\n* [[Macalester College]] \u2013 Saint Paul\n* [[Metropolitan State University]] \u2013 Saint Paul and Minneapolis\n* [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[Minneapolis Community and Technical College]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] \u2013 Edina\n* [[William Mitchell College of Law|Mitchell Hamline School of Law]] \u2013 Saint Paul\n* [[Normandale Community College]] \u2013 Bloomington\n* [[North Central University]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[North Hennepin Community College]] \u2013 Brooklyn Park\n* [[Northwestern Health Sciences University]] \u2013 Bloomington\n* [[Rasmussen College]] \u2013 Bloomington, Blaine, Brooklyn Park, Eagan and Lake Elmo\n* [[St. Catherine University]] \u2013 Saint Paul and Minneapolis\n* [[St. Cloud State University]] \u2013 St. Cloud and Maple Grove\n* [[St. Mary's University of Minnesota]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n* [[Saint Paul College]] \u2013 Saint Paul\n* [[United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities|United Theological Seminary]] \u2013 New Brighton\n* [[University of Minnesota]] \u2013 Minneapolis and Saint Paul (Falcon Heights)\n* [[Northwestern College (Minnesota)|University of Northwestern \u2013 Saint Paul]] \u2013 Roseville\n* [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]] \u2013 Saint Paul and Minneapolis\n* [[University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls|University of Wisconsin]] \u2013 River Falls and Hudson\n* [[Walden University]] \u2013 Minneapolis\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{See also|Transportation in Minnesota}}\n\n===Roads and highways===\n[[File:Walker Art Center-Minneapolis-061230.jpg|thumb|[[Walker Art Center]] on [[Hennepin Avenue]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]\nIn the 20th century, the Twin Cities area expanded outward significantly. Automobiles made it possible for [[suburb]]s to grow greatly. The area now has a number of [[freeway]]s to transport people by car. The area incorporates a large number of [[traffic camera]]s and [[ramp meter]]s to monitor and manage [[traffic congestion]]. There is some use of HOV ([[high-occupancy vehicle]]) express lanes, which is becoming much more common. In order to use an express lane, a driver must have a [[MnPASS]] transponder or have at least one passenger. MnPASS rates are determined by the amount of traffic on the road and/or the time of day. During non-peak times, the MnPASS express lanes, with the exception of those on [[Interstate 394 (Minnesota)|Interstate 394]] (I-394) between [[Minnesota Highway 100]] (MN&nbsp;100) and [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]], are open to all traffic.\n\nI-94 comes into the area from the east and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the [[Interstate 494|I-494]]/[[Interstate 694|I-694]] loop, and I-394 continues west when I-94 turns north. Additionally, [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|I-35]] splits in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] in the southern part of the Twin Cities region, bringing [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] into Saint Paul and [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] into Minneapolis. They join together again to the north in [[Columbus, Minnesota|Columbus]], (just south of [[Forest Lake, Minnesota|Forest Lake]]) and continue to the highway's terminus in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. This is one of only two examples of an Interstate Highway splitting into branches and then rejoining into one again; the other split occurs in [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], where I-35 also splits east and west branches.\n\nOn August 1, 2007, a large portion of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] near University Avenue in the city of Minneapolis collapsed into the [[Mississippi River]] around 6:05pm [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CDT]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/allheadlines/ci_6518669 | title=35W bridge collapses over Mississippi River, cars in the water | newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/S156329.shtml?cat=1 | title=35W bridge over Mississippi collapsed |location = St. Paul | publisher=[[KSTP-TV]] | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-08-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016155630/http://kstp.com/article/stories/S156329.shtml?cat=1 | archive-date=October 16, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A [[St. Anthony Falls (35W) Bridge|replacement bridge]] opened on Thursday, September 18, 2008.\n\n===Interstates===\n* [[File:I-35 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|I-35]]\n* [[File:I-35E (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]]\n* [[File:I-35W (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]]\n* [[File:I-94 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]]\n* [[File:I-394 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 394|I-394]]\n* [[File:I-494 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 494|I-494]]\n* [[File:I-694 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Interstate 694|I-694]]\n\n===U.S. Highways===\n* [[File:US 10.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[U.S. Route 10 in Minnesota|US 10]]\n* [[File:US 12.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[U.S. Route 12 in Minnesota|US 12]]\n* [[File:US 52.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[U.S. Route 52 in Minnesota|US 52]] (Lafayette Freeway)\n* [[File:US 61 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[U.S. Route 61 in Minnesota|US 61]] (Blues Highway)\n* [[File:US 169 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[U.S. Route 169 in Minnesota|US 169]] (Johnson Memorial Highway)\n* [[File:US 212 (MN).svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[U.S. Route 212 in Minnesota|US 212]] (Minnesota Veterans Memorial Highway)\n\n===Major state highways===\n* [[File:MN-36.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 36|MN 36]]\n* [[File:MN-55.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 55|MN 55]] (Olson Memorial Highway)\n* [[File:MN-62.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (east)|MN 62]] (Crosstown Highway)\n* [[File:MN-65.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 65|MN 65]]\n* [[File:MN-77.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 77|MN 77]] (Cedar Avenue)\n* [[File:MN-100.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 100|MN 100]]\n* [[File:MN-252.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 252|MN 252]]\n* [[File:MN-610.svg|x24px|alt=|link=]] [[Minnesota State Highway 610|MN 610]]\n\n===Air travel===\nThe main [[airport]] in the region is [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport]] (MSP), which is a major hub for [[Delta Air Lines]].

Metro Transit provides about 95% of the [[public transit]] rides in the region with over 900 buses, although some suburbs have other bus services. The [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota, Twin Cities]] operates a free bus system between its campuses. This system includes the Campus Connector [[Bus Rapid Transit]] line which travels between the Minneapolis and Saint Paul Campuses by a dedicated bus line, and throughout the two campuses on normal access roads. The [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] LRT ([[light rail]]) began operations in June 2004, connecting downtown Minneapolis, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport]] and the [[Mall of America]] in Bloomington.

It is an example of [[Twin cities|twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity]]. Minnesotans living outside of Minneapolis and Saint Paul often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as \"the cities.\"\n\nThere are several different definitions of the region. Many refer to the ''Twin Cities'' as the seven-county region which is governed under the [[Metropolitan Council]] regional governmental agency and planning organization. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] officially designates 16 counties as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013Bloomington MN\u2013WI Metropolitan Statistical Area\", the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|16th largest]] in the [[United States]]. The entire region known as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area\", has a population of 4,014,593, the [[Combined Statistical Area|14th largest]], according to 2018 Census estimates.\n\nDespite the Twin moniker, both cities are independent municipalities with defined borders. Minneapolis is somewhat younger with more modern skyscrapers downtown, while Saint Paul has been likened to an [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]] city, with quaint neighborhoods and a vast collection of well-preserved late-[[Victorian architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/stpaul |title=St. Paul travel guide<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232949/http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/stpaul |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status = dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nMinneapolis was influenced by its early [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Lutheran]] heritage, while Saint Paul was influenced by its early [[French Canadian|French]], [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|German]] [[Catholic]] roots.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Minnesota|History of Wisconsin}}\n[[File:Stillwater-2004-01-02.jpg|thumb|[[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]], [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]]]]\nThe first European settlement in the region was near what is now known as the town of [[Stillwater, Minnesota]]. The city is approximately {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} from downtown Saint Paul and lies on the western bank of the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]], which forms the border of central Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that began fueling early interest in the area was the outpost at [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]], which was constructed from 1820 to 1825 at the [[confluence]] of the [[Minnesota River]] and the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/military-history/expansionist-era |title=The Expansionist Era (1805\u20131858) |website=Minnesota Historical Society |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFort Snelling held jurisdiction over the land south of [[Saint Anthony Falls]], thus a town known as Saint Anthony grew just north of the river. For several years, the only European resident to live on the south bank of the river was Colonel [[John H. Stevens]], who operated a [[ferry]] service across the river. As soon as the land area controlled by Fort Snelling was reduced, new settlers began flocking across to the new village of Minneapolis. The town grew quickly, and Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merged.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Minneapolis |website=Minneapolis Public Library |year=2001 |url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh4.asp |access-date=2 May 2019 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104133936/http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh4.asp |archive-date=4 January 2009}}</ref> On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig's Eye and Lambert's Landing developed and would soon grow to become Saint Paul.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitsaintpaul.com/blog/an-early-history-of-saint-paul/ |title=An Early History |website=Visit Saint Paul |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stpaul001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], showing barges on the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Minnesota State Capitol|Capitol dome]], and [[Minneapolis]]'s skyline in the far background (right of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]). In the lower right is a typical nineteenth century home. Taken from [[Indian Mounds Park (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Indian Mounds Park]].]]\nNatural geography played a role in the settlement and development of the two cities. The [[Mississippi River Valley]] in this area is defined by a series of stone bluffs that line both sides of the river. Saint Paul grew up around Lambert's Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an easily accessible point, some seven miles (11&nbsp;km) downstream from [[Saint Anthony Falls]], the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense water power for industry, defined the location of Minneapolis and its prominence as the Mill City. The falls can be seen today from the [[Mill City Museum]], housed in the former [[Washburn \"A\" Mill]], which was among the world's largest mills in its time.\n\nThe oldest farms in the state are located in Washington County, the eastern most county on the Minnesota side of the metropolitan area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota's first farmer, harvesting the first crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading Post Trail.<ref>{{cite book |title=Afton Remembered |first=Edwin G. |last=Robb |year=1996 |publisher=Afton Historical Society Press |isbn=978-0-9639338-7-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Afton_Remembered.html?id=iuRhAAAACAAJ }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ford lock and dam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River]] just upstream of the [[Minnesota River]]]]\nThe [[Grand Excursion]], a trip into the Upper [[Midwest]] sponsored by the [[Rock Island Railroad]], brought more than a thousand curious travelers into the area by [[railroad|rail]] and [[steamboat]] in 1854. The next year, in 1855, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', an [[epic poem]] based on the [[Ojibwe]] legends of [[Hiawatha]]. A number of natural area landmarks were included in the story, such as [[Lake Minnetonka]] and [[Minnehaha Falls]]. [[Tourism|Tourists]] inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and those who read Longfellow's story flocked to the area in the following decades.\n\nAt one time, the region also had numerous passenger rail services, including both interurban [[streetcar]] systems and interstate rail. Due to the width of the river at points further south, the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed by [[railroad]]. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul had long been at the [[head of navigation]] on the river, prior to a new [[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River|lock and dam facility]] being added upriver in Minneapolis.\n\nPassenger travel hit its peak in 1888 with nearly eight million traversing to and from the [[Saint Paul Union Depot]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} This amounted to approximately 150 trains daily. Before long, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies to combat the rise of the [[automobile]], some of the earliest [[streamliner]]s ran from [[Chicago]] to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant points in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Today, the only vestige of this interstate service comes by [[Amtrak]]'s [[King Street Station|Seattle]]/[[Portland Union Station|Portland]] to [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]] ''[[Empire Builder]]'' route, running once daily in each direction. It is named after [[James J. Hill]], a railroad [[tycoon]] who settled on [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]] in Saint Paul at what is now known as the [[James J. Hill House]].\n\nLike many Northern cities that grew up with the [[Industrial Revolution]], Minneapolis and St. Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 60s and 70s came population decline in the [[Demographics of Minneapolis|central city areas]], [[white flight]] to suburbs,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=It Couldn't Happen Here... |title=Metropolitics : a regional agenda for community and stability |first=Myron, Jr. |last=Orfield |isbn=0-8157-6640-8 |location=Washington DC |publisher=Brookings Institution |year=1997 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/metropoliticsreg00orfi/page/n20 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/metropoliticsreg00orfi }}</ref> and, in the summer of 1967, [[race riots]] on Minneapolis's North Side.<ref>{{cite news |last=Neset |first=Ray |title=Plymouth Avenue 40 Years Later |date=July 20, 2007 |url=http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=128&Itemid=1 |url-status = dead|newspaper=Minneapolis Mirror |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109122142/http://mplsmirror.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=128&Itemid=1 |archive-date=9 January 2009 |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and Saint Paul were frequently cited as former [[Rust Belt]] cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A Tale of Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul |last1=Abercrombie |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Griffiths |first2=Annie |magazine=National Geographic |date=November 1980 |volume=156 |number=5 |pages=664\u2013691 }}</ref>\n\n==Populated places==\n===Counties===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, or The Cities, includes 16 counties, of which 14 are in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin.

Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole.

It hosts both a [[KSJN|classical station]] and a contemporary station, [[KCMP|The Current]], which plays music from regional and other contemporary artists. The [[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]] program ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', hosted by Minnesota native [[Garrison Keillor]] aired live for many years from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]. The show ended its run in 2016, with its successor ''[[Live from Here]]'' also airing from the same venue. This radio program was the basis of the 2006 film of the same name, [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]].\n\n[[KCMP|The Current]] and [[Walker Art Center|The Walker Art Center]] also host an annual music festival [[Rock the Garden]], which features nationally recognized and local artists.

Minneapolis is home to the famous [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]]. First Avenue is known for being the starting venue for many famous artists and bands that have come from the area including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], [[Manny Phesto]] and others. It became one of the most recognizable venues in Minnesota following the release of the Prince movie [[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]], in which the venue is featured.\n\n===Outdoors===\n[[File:Bounce-Saint Paul-2006-05-11.jpg|thumb|left|A Saint Paul Bouncing Team aerialist exhibition in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]]]\nThere are numerous [[lake]]s in the region, and cities in the area have some very extensive [[park]] systems for [[recreation]]. Organized recreation includes the [[Great River Energy bicycle festival]], the [[Twin Cities Marathon]], and the U.S. [[pond hockey]] championships. Some studies have shown that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, [[medicine]] is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], as the [[University of Minnesota]] has joined other [[college]]s and [[hospital]]s in doing significant research, and major [[medical device]] manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is [[Medtronic]]). Technical innovators have brought important advances in [[computing]], including the [[Cray]] line of [[supercomputers]].\n\nIt is common for residents of the Twin Cities area to own or share [[cabin (housing)|cabin]]s and other properties along lakes and [[forest]]ed areas in the central and northern regions of the state, and weekend trips \"up North\" happen through the warmer months. [[Ice fishing]] is also a major pastime in the winter, although each year some overambitious [[fishing|fishermen]] find themselves in dangerous situations when they venture out onto the [[ice]] too early or too late. [[Hunting]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV riding]] and numerous other outdoor activities are also popular. This connectedness with the outdoors also brings a strong sense of [[environmentalism]] to many Minnesotans.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] named Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul the healthiest metropolitan area in America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Actively Moving America to Better Health|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/docs/reports/2011_afi_report_final.pdf|year=2011|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=May 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908154409/http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/docs/reports/2011_afi_report_final.pdf|archive-date=September 8, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/docs/reports/2012_afi_report_final.pdf|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) American Fitness Index|year=2012|title=Health and Community Fitness Status of the 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas|accessdate=June 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903122215/http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/docs/reports/2012_afi_report_final.pdf|archive-date=September 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n\n===Place of birth===\nApproximately 93.2% of the metropolitan area's population was native to the United States.

The rest of the population (6.8%) were foreign-born.\n\nThe highest percentages of immigrants came from Asia (38.2%), Latin America (25.4%), and Africa (20.1%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Europe (13.1%), other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.2%).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nWith regards to ethnicity, the metropolitan area is predominantly white, with every county having at least 70% of its population coming from that background. However, the area is gradually becoming more diverse over time.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Church in Chaska-20070203.jpg|thumb|Guardian Angels Catholic Church in [[Chaska, Minnesota|Chaska]]]]\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul is also a major center for religion in the state, especially [[Christianity]]. The state headquarters of five major Christian churches are found here: the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]], the [[Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota]], the [[Presbyterian]] Synod of Lakes and Prairies, and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington as well as the Orthodox Church in America.\n\nThe headquarters of the former [[American Lutheran Church]] [[American Lutheran Church|(ALC)]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Lutheran Free Church]] and the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]] were located in Minneapolis; the headquarters of [[Augsburg Fortress]] publishing house still is. The [[Minneapolis Area Synod]] and the [[Saint Paul Area Synod]] are the first and third largest synods of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]]), respectively.\n\nThe [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] has its headquarters in Bloomington, and the [[Association of Free Lutheran Congregations]] is headquartered in Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School.\n\nThe Twin Cities are home to several [[synagogue]]s serving the [[Judaism|Jewish]] population, which is concentrated in the western Minneapolis suburbs of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park, Plymouth and Minnetonka. There is also a Hindu temple located in the Twin Cities suburb of [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]]. A recent influx of immigrants from [[Laos]] and [[North Africa|Northern Africa]] has brought many more religions to the area. There are several [[Islam]]ic [[Masjid]]s in the area. There is a temple for the religion of [[Eckankar]] in the suburb of [[Chanhassen]] known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhist]] peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS [[St. Paul Minnesota Temple]] opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are several very strong [[Unitarian Universalist]] communities such as the [[First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis|First Unitarian Society]] of Minneapolis, as well as several [[Paganism|Pagan]] and [[Buddhist]] groups. The cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis have been called [[Paganistan]] due to the large numbers of Pagans living there.<ref>[http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/April-2009/MNMO-Recommends/ Welcome to Paganistan]</ref> There are an estimated 20,000 Pagans living in the Twin Cities area.<ref>[http://m.startribune.com/articles/206115007 Wiccan prisoner sues state, claiming religious rights violated] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nMinneapolis is where the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] started and was its home for more than fifty years.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sports in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Sports in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mnrg0301 195840.jpg|thumb|Over 3,700 fans attend the opening bout of the 2007 [[Minnesota RollerGirls]] season]]\n\nThe Twin Cities is one of [[U.S. cities with teams from four major league sports|thirteen American metropolitan areas]] to have teams in all four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] \u2014 Baseball (MLB), Football (NFL), Basketball (NBA) and Ice Hockey (NHL).

The land of the area sits on top of thick layers of [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural [[cave]]s to develop, which were expanded into [[mining|mine]]s when white settlers came to the area. In the time of [[Prohibition]], at least one [[speakeasy]] was built into these hidden spaces\u2014eventually refurbished as the [[Wabasha Street Caves]] in Saint Paul.\n\nLakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of [[glacier]]s. This left many bodies of water in the region, and unusual shapes may appear. For example, [[Lake Minnetonka]] out toward the western side of the Twin Cities consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations in the metropolitan area range from {{convert|1376|ft|m|0}} above sea level in the northwest metro to {{convert|666|ft|m|0}} at the edge of the [[Mississippi River]] in the southeast.\n\n[[File:Bald Eagle-Burnsville-2006-01-15.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bald eagle]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]]]]\nBecause it is comparatively easy to dig through limestone and there are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area should examine the idea of building [[rapid transit|subway]]s for public transportation.

But in early 2005, it was found that the [[IDS Center]] is taller by a {{convert|16|ft|m|0|adj=on}} washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to {{convert|792|ft|m}}. [[Capella Tower]] and the [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Wells Fargo Center]] only differ in height by a [[foot (unit)|foot]] or two, a rather negligible amount.\n\nBuildings have gone up and been torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been demolished six or seven times since the mid-19th century, and will undoubtedly reach an eighth or ninth cycle in short order.<ref name=\"Millett\">{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Larry|title=Lost Twin Cities|year=1992|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|location=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]]}}</ref> No single architectural style dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once a great many stone buildings constructed in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). [[Minneapolis City Hall]] is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types\u2014including personal residences such as the [[James J. Hill House]]\u2014were similarly designed.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Paul Clifford|last1=Larson|last2=Martin|first2=Judith|editor-last=Larson|editor-first=Paul Clifford |title=The Spirit of H.H.

The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades while Saint Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so as to better accompany its older structures.\n\n[[File:MendotaBridge8.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mendota Bridge]] over the [[Minnesota River]] between [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] and [[Mendota, Minnesota|Mendota]]]]\nSaint Paul and Minneapolis in particular went through some massive [[urban renewal]] projects in the post-[[World War II]] era, so a vast number of buildings are now lost to history. Some of the larger and harder to demolish structures have survived.<ref name=\"Millett\" /> In fact, the area might be signified more by [[bridge]]s than buildings. A series of [[reinforced concrete]] [[arch]] spans crossing the Mississippi River were built in the 1920s and 1930s. They still carry daily traffic, but remain pleasing to the eye despite their age (a number have undergone major repair work, but retain the original design). Several of the bridges are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. They include the [[10th Avenue Bridge]], [[Intercity Bridge]] (Ford Parkway), [[Robert Street Bridge]], and the longest, the {{convert|4119|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Mendota Bridge]] next to Fort Snelling. The area is also noted for having the first known permanent crossing of the Mississippi. That structure is long gone, but a series of [[Hennepin Avenue Bridge]]s have been built since then at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as [[skyway]]s.\n\n[[File:Guthrie-North.jpg|thumb|[[Guthrie Theater]] on the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]]]\nSeveral prominent buildings in Minneapolis have helped modernize the city. These include the [[Walker Art Center]], [[Minneapolis Public Library|Central Public Library]], [[Weisman Art Museum]] and the [[Guthrie Theater]]. Opening in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double in size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts organization and as a national leader for its innovative approaches to audience engagement.

Automobiles made it possible for [[suburb]]s to grow greatly. The area now has a number of [[freeway]]s to transport people by car. The area incorporates a large number of [[traffic camera]]s and [[ramp meter]]s to monitor and manage [[traffic congestion]]. There is some use of HOV ([[high-occupancy vehicle]]) express lanes, which is becoming much more common. In order to use an express lane, a driver must have a [[MnPASS]] transponder or have at least one passenger. MnPASS rates are determined by the amount of traffic on the road and/or the time of day. During non-peak times, the MnPASS express lanes, with the exception of those on [[Interstate 394 (Minnesota)|Interstate 394]] (I-394) between [[Minnesota Highway 100]] (MN&nbsp;100) and [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]], are open to all traffic.\n\nI-94 comes into the area from the east and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the [[Interstate 494|I-494]]/[[Interstate 694|I-694]] loop, and I-394 continues west when I-94 turns north.

KTCA created the science program ''[[Newton's Apple]]'' and distributes a children's program today. A few unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (predecessor to WUCW) created a number of low-budget shows, including cult classic ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

{"title_page": "Area codes 778, 236, and 672", "text_new": "{{short description|Overlay area codes for British Columbia, Canada}}\n'''Area codes 778, 236, and 672''' are [[Overlay plan|overlay]] [[area code]]s for the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]]. They overlay the existing area codes, [[area code 604|604]] and [[area code 250|250]], simultaneously, requiring [[ten-digit dialling]] throughout the province. The area codes also serve the United States community of [[Hyder, Alaska]], which sits along the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] near the town of [[Stewart, British Columbia|Stewart]].\n\n==History==\nArea code 604 had served as British Columbia's sole area code for 53 years before 250 was created as the area code for [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] in 1997, with 604 cut back to serve [[Vancouver]] and the [[Lower Mainland]]. This was intended as a long-term solution; however, within four years, 604 was on the brink of exhaustion once again due to Canada's number allocation system. Every [[competitive local exchange carrier]] is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers\u2014corresponding to a single prefix\u2014for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even in the smallest hamlets. While most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers, a number cannot be allocated elsewhere once assigned to a rate centre and carrier.  \n\nWhile numbers tended to be used up fairly quickly in the immediate Vancouver area due to its rapid growth, the number allocation problem was particularly severe in the Lower Mainland. It is home to most of the province's landlines and cell phones. \n\nTo solve this problem, area code 778 was created on November 3, 2001, as a concentrated overlay for the two largest [[list of regional districts of British Columbia|regional districts]] in the Lower Mainland, [[Metro Vancouver]] and the [[Fraser Valley Regional District]]. The rest of the Lower Mainland continued to use only 604.<ref>[http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/pl-nanp-246.pdf NANP Planning Letter PL-246]</ref> Nonetheless, the implementation of 778 made [[10-digit dialing]] mandatory across the Lower Mainland.\n\nIn early 2007, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) faced the prospect that 250 would exhaust in early 2008. Relief proposals included:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pt2007-2.htm |title=New dialing to come in British Columbia |access-date=May 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629062145/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pt2007-2.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n* a geographic split that would have seen the Interior retain 250, with Vancouver Island switching to a new area code\n* expanding 778 to the 250 territory\n* concentrated overlays covering part of the 250 territory\n\nUltimately, the CRTC concluded that there was not enough time to implement a split before 250 was due to exhaust. Additionally, the major landline and cell phone providers in the 250 territory contended that an overlay would be far easier to implement than a split. [[Telus]] and other carriers wanted to spare their Vancouver Island customers the expense and burden of changing their numbers for the second time in a decade.<ref name=CRTC>[https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/dt2007-38.pdf Telecom Decision 2007-38]</ref>  \n\nAccordingly, the CRTC announced on June 7, 2007, that 778 would become an overlay for the entire province effective July 4, 2007.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/NEWS/RELEASES/2007/r070607.htm New dialing to come in British Columbia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626081224/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/NEWS/RELEASES/2007/r070607.htm |date=June 26, 2009 }}</ref>  Overlays have become the preferred method of relief in Canada, as they are an easy workaround for the number allocation problem; no area codes have been split in the country since 1999.\n\nAs of June 23, 2008, ten-digit dialling became mandatory across British Columbia; attempting to use seven digits would trigger an [[intercept message]] reminding callers of the new rule.

They overlay the existing area codes, [[area code 604|604]] and [[area code 250|250]], simultaneously, requiring [[ten-digit dialling]] throughout the province. The area codes also serve the United States community of [[Hyder, Alaska]], which sits along the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] near the town of [[Stewart, British Columbia|Stewart]].\n\n==History==\nArea code 604 had served as British Columbia's sole area code for 53 years before 250 was created as the area code for [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] in 1997, with 604 cut back to serve [[Vancouver]] and the [[Lower Mainland]]. This was intended as a long-term solution; however, within four years, 604 was on the brink of exhaustion once again due to Canada's number allocation system. Every [[competitive local exchange carrier]] is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers\u2014corresponding to a single prefix\u2014for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even in the smallest hamlets. While most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers, a number cannot be allocated elsewhere once assigned to a rate centre and carrier. This results in thousands of wasted numbers. \n\nWhile numbers tended to be used up fairly quickly in the immediate Vancouver area due to its rapid growth, the number allocation problem was particularly severe in the Lower Mainland. It is home to most of the province's landlines and cell phones. \n\nTo solve this problem, area code 778 was created on November 3, 2001, as a concentrated overlay for the two largest [[list of regional districts of British Columbia|regional districts]] in the Lower Mainland, [[Metro Vancouver]] and the [[Fraser Valley Regional District]]. The rest of the Lower Mainland continued to use only 604.<ref>[http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/pl-nanp-246.pdf NANP Planning Letter PL-246]</ref> Nonetheless, the implementation of 778 made [[10-digit dialing]] mandatory across the Lower Mainland.\n\nIn early 2007, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) faced the prospect that 250 would exhaust in early 2008. Relief proposals included:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pt2007-2.htm |title=New dialing to come in British Columbia |access-date=May 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629062145/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pt2007-2.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n* a geographic split that would have seen the Interior retain 250, with Vancouver Island switching to a new area code\n* expanding 778 to the 250 territory\n* concentrated overlays covering part of the 250 territory\n\nUltimately, the CRTC concluded that there was not enough time to implement a split before 250 was due to exhaust. Additionally, the major landline and cell phone providers in the 250 territory contended that an overlay would be far easier to implement than a split. [[Telus]] and other carriers wanted to spare their Vancouver Island customers the expense and burden of changing their numbers for the second time in a decade.<ref name=CRTC>[https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/dt2007-38.pdf Telecom Decision 2007-38]</ref>  \n\nAccordingly, the CRTC announced on June 7, 2007, that 778 would become an overlay for the entire province effective July 4, 2007.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/NEWS/RELEASES/2007/r070607.htm New dialing to come in British Columbia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626081224/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/NEWS/RELEASES/2007/r070607.htm |date=June 26, 2009 }}</ref>  Overlays have become the preferred method of relief in Canada, as they are an easy workaround for the number allocation problem; no area codes have been split in the country since 1999.\n\nAs of June 23, 2008, ten-digit dialling became mandatory across British Columbia; attempting to use seven digits would trigger an [[intercept message]] reminding callers of the new rule. After September 12, 2008, seven-digit dialling ceased to function.<ref>[http://www.ctvbc.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20080622/BC_Ten_Digit_Dialing_080622/20080622/?hub=BritishColumbiaHome Ten-digit dialing coming to all of B.C.]</ref>\n\nThis was intended as a long-term solution, but within four years 604, 250 and 778 were close to exhaustion once again.

Initially, [[French Border Police]] officers checked passengers' travel documents while on board the train before arriving in or after departing from their station in France. No customs checks were carried out on board the train. Starting from June 1998, the French Border Police set up control booths at [[Gare du Nord|Paris Gare du Nord]], [[Gare de Lille-Europe|Lille Europe]] and [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]] stations. This led to a gradual phasing out of onboard immigration checks (in 1998, 3,638 onboard checks were carried out, whereas in 2000, only 642 onboard checks were carried out). At Calais-Fr\u00e9thun station, passengers were routinely checked both on arrival and on departure. However, at Paris Gare du Nord and Lille Europe stations, passengers were only checked on departure and not on arrival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senat.fr/rap/l00-240/l00-240_mono.html |title=Projet de loi relatif au contr\u00f4le des personnes empruntant la liaison ferroviaire entre la France et le Royaume-Uni |language=fr |publisher=[[Senate (France)]]}}</ref> Due to the design of the arrival train platforms at Lille Europe station, the French Border Police could only stop and check around 11% of the alighting passengers arriving from London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rapports/r2985.asp |title=Rapport sur le projet de loi, adopte par le S\u00e9nat, autorisant l'approbation du Protocole additionnel au Protocole de Sangatte entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement du Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord relatif \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de bureaux charg\u00e9s du contr\u00f4le des personnes empruntant la liaison ferroviaire reliant la France et le Royaume-Uni |language=fr |publisher=[[National Assembly (France)]]}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 2000, the 'Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol' was signed between France and the UK, an agreement that provided for immigration checkpoints to be set up by France in Eurostar stations in the UK and for immigration checkpoints to be set up by the UK in Eurostar stations in France. The UK was eager to conclude the agreement with France because, for several years, many Eurostar passengers arrived in the UK without adequate documentation and a significant number claimed [[Right of asylum|asylum]] on arrival. As an illustration, in the second half of 2000, around 4,000 passengers arrived at [[Waterloo International railway station|London Waterloo]] without the correct documentation. Furthermore, under French law, there was no liability for [[SNCF]], the French railway company, to check the [[travel document]]s of Eurostar passengers (in fact, it was illegal under French law for SNCF to carry out documentation checks), which meant that the Eurostar was an easier way for [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] to travel from France to the UK than other means of transport (for example, in contrast, an airline carrier would be fined a \u00a32,000 penalty for every passenger without adequate documentation who is brought to the UK, which encouraged airlines to check the travel documents of passengers more carefully).<ref>{{cite web  |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010316/text/10316-05.htm |title=Lords Hansard text for 16 March 2001 (Column 1124-1125) |publisher=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), [[House of Lords]]}}</ref> The Additional Protocol was subsequently brought into effect in France by Law No. 2001-409 of 11 May 2001<ref>{{cite French law|number or usual name=n\u00b0 2001-409|date in French=11 mai 2001 |language=French |full name=autorisant l'approbation du protocole additionnel au protocole de Sangatte entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement du Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord relatif \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de bureaux charg\u00e9s du contr\u00f4le des personnes empruntant la liaison ferroviaire reliant la France et le Royaume-Uni |URL=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000223217&categorieLien=id}}</ref> and in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) (Amendment No. 3) Order 2001.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=si |year=2001 |number=1544 | si=The Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) (Amendment No. 3) Order 2001}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 October 2004, an Administrative Arrangement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK to extend juxtaposed controls to Eurostar services between London and Brussels which make a stop in Lille.<ref name=\"2004memorandum\"/> This was subsequently brought into effect in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Order 2004.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=si |year=2004 |number=2589 | si=The Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Order 2004}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the agreements, when travelling from the UK to Belgium or France by Eurostar, immigration entry checks into the [[Schengen Area]] take place before boarding the train in the UK, rather than on arrival in Belgium or France.

The United Kingdom was until 31 January 2020 a member state of the European Union, but did not participate in the Schengen Area. Some Eurostar services from Brussels to London made a stop in Lille/Calais. On such trains, passengers who boarded in Brussels and disembarked in Lille would be travelling within the Schengen Area, and therefore not be subject to border checks. The [[Belgian Federal Police]] did not permit [[UK Border Agency]] officers stationed at the juxtaposed controls at [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] station to question or check the documents of passengers travelling on a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cox |first=Simon |date=8 December 2011 |title=UK border staff in arrest threat over 'Lille loophole' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16058860 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> On the other hand, passengers boarding the same train in Brussels travelling on a ticket to the UK would be subject to exit checks leaving the Schengen Area and entry checks to the UK at the juxtaposed controls in Brussels-South station. This situation created a loophole (which was commonly referred to as the 'Lille loophole') whereby certain passengers who buy a train ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais and therefore not go through the juxtaposed controls before boarding the train in Brussels, but would remain on the train after Lille/Calais and continue to the UK, thereby leaving the Schengen Area and entering the UK without having undergone the proper border checks. A number of passengers were able to travel to the UK and claim asylum on arrival in the UK using this method.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/546809/An-Inspection-of-Juxtaposed-Controls_Aug_2013.pdf |title=An Inspection of Juxtaposed Controls (November 2012 - March 2013) |publisher=[[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration]] |date=8 August 2013 |access-date=28 March 2020 |at=paras 4.3-4.4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=8 December 2011 |title=Tighter checks pledged to close Eurostar 'loophole' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-16092647 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter this loophole came to light in December 2011, Eurostar initially suspended the sale of point to point Brussels to Lille/Calais tickets, while maintaining the sale of season tickets on this route. Subsequently, Eurostar resumed the sale of tickets, but restricted the sale of Brussels-Lille/Calais tickets to 3 daily services. Upon arrival at Lille, the number of Brussels-Lille tickets sold were reconciled with the total number of disembarkations. Security guards conducted ticket inspections on passengers before the trains arrived at Calais, where those without a valid ticket to the UK would be instructed to disembark. In addition to the pre-embarkation juxtaposed controls, the UK Border Force also checked the travel documents of passengers travelling on these 3 services on arrival at London St Pancras International station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmhaff/71/71.pdf |title=The work of the UK Border Agency (December 2011\u2013March 2012) |publisher=[[House of Commons]] [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] |at=Ev 61 |date=16 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2012-04-23/debates/1204237000932/ImmigrationEurostar |title=House of Lords Hansard for 23 April 2012, Volume 736 (Immigration: Eurostar) |publisher=[[House of Lords]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, Belgium and the UK signed an agreement clarifying that at the juxtaposed controls in Brussels-South station, 'Immigration controls performed by the United Kingdom are only permitted on passengers whose travel destination is stated to be within the United Kingdom'.

As a consequence, after the result of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], there were increased calls in France to scrap the Treaty of Le Touquet and end juxtaposed controls, including from the then French Presidential candidates [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] and [[Emmanuel Macron]], and from the [[List of the mayors of Calais|Mayor of Calais]], [[Natacha Bouchart]]. However, such calls have since receded, as political leaders in France and the UK have sought to reinforce their commitment to bilateral border cooperation (for example, by entering into the Sandhurst Treaty). At the same time, the Committee has noted that although the agreements establishing juxtaposed controls are 'not formally EU-dependent, the agreements underpinning bilateral border cooperation have undoubtedly been easier to sustain under the shared umbrella of EU membership'.<ref name=\"HL Paper 428\">{{cite web|title=48th Report of Session 2017\u201319 - Brexit: refugee protection and asylum policy (HL Paper 428) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/428/42806.htm#footnote-124-backlink |date=11 October 2019 |publisher=[[House of Lords]] [[European Union Committee]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom [[Brexit|ceased to be a member state of the European Union]].

Initially, [[French Border Police]] officers checked passengers' travel documents while on board the train before arriving in or after departing from their station in France. No customs checks were carried out on board the train. Starting from June 1998, the French Border Police set up control booths at [[Gare du Nord|Paris Gare du Nord]], [[Gare de Lille-Europe|Lille Europe]] and [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]] stations. This led to a gradual phasing out of onboard immigration checks (in 1998, 3,638 onboard checks were carried out, whereas in 2000, only 642 onboard checks were carried out). At Calais-Fr\u00e9thun station, passengers were routinely checked both on arrival and on departure. However, at Paris Gare du Nord and Lille Europe stations, passengers were only checked on departure and not on arrival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senat.fr/rap/l00-240/l00-240_mono.html |title=Projet de loi relatif au contr\u00f4le des personnes empruntant la liaison ferroviaire entre la France et le Royaume-Uni |language=fr |publisher=[[Senate (France)]]}}</ref> Due to the design of the arrival train platforms at Lille Europe station, the French Border Police could only stop and check around 11% of the alighting passengers arriving from London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rapports/r2985.asp |title=Rapport sur le projet de loi, adopte par le S\u00e9nat, autorisant l'approbation du Protocole additionnel au Protocole de Sangatte entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement du Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord relatif \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de bureaux charg\u00e9s du contr\u00f4le des personnes empruntant la liaison ferroviaire reliant la France et le Royaume-Uni |language=fr |publisher=[[National Assembly (France)]]}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 2000, the 'Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol' was signed between France and the UK, an agreement that provided for immigration checkpoints to be set up by France in Eurostar stations in the UK and for immigration checkpoints to be set up by the UK in Eurostar stations in France. The UK was eager to conclude the agreement with France because, for several years, many Eurostar passengers arrived in the UK without adequate documentation and a significant number claimed [[Right of asylum|asylum]] on arrival. As an illustration, in the second half of 2000, around 4,000 passengers arrived at [[Waterloo International railway station|London Waterloo]] without the correct documentation. Furthermore, under French law, there was no liability for [[SNCF]], the French railway company, to check the [[travel document]]s of Eurostar passengers (in fact, it was illegal under French law for SNCF to carry out documentation checks), which meant that the Eurostar was an easier way for [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] to travel from France to the UK than other means of transport (for example, in contrast, an airline carrier would be fined a \u00a32,000 penalty for every passenger without adequate documentation who is brought to the UK, which encouraged airlines to check the travel documents of passengers more carefully).<ref>{{cite web  |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010316/text/10316-05.htm |title=Lords Hansard text for 16 March 2001 (Column 1124-1125) |publisher=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), [[House of Lords]]}}</ref> The Additional Protocol was subsequently brought into effect in France by Law No. 2001-409 of 11 May 2001<ref>{{cite French law|number or usual name=n\u00b0 2001-409|date in French=11 mai 2001 |language=French |full name=autorisant l'approbation du protocole additionnel au protocole de Sangatte entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement du Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord relatif \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de bureaux charg\u00e9s du contr\u00f4le des personnes empruntant la liaison ferroviaire reliant la France et le Royaume-Uni |URL=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000223217&categorieLien=id}}</ref> and in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) (Amendment No. 3) Order 2001.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=si |year=2001 |number=1544 | si=The Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) (Amendment No. 3) Order 2001}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 October 2004, an Administrative Arrangement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK to extend juxtaposed controls to Eurostar services between London and Brussels which make a stop in Lille.<ref name=\"2004memorandum\"/> This was subsequently brought into effect in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Order 2004.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=si |year=2004 |number=2589 | si=The Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Order 2004}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the agreements, when travelling from the UK to Belgium or France by Eurostar, immigration entry checks into the [[Schengen Area]] take place before boarding the train in the UK, rather than on arrival in Belgium or France.

The United Kingdom was until 31 January 2020 a member state of the European Union, but did not participate in the Schengen Area. Some Eurostar services from Brussels to London made a stop in Lille/Calais. On such trains, passengers who boarded in Brussels and disembarked in Lille would be travelling within the Schengen Area, and therefore not be subject to border checks. The [[Belgian Federal Police]] did not permit [[UK Border Agency]] officers stationed at the juxtaposed controls at [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] station to question or check the documents of passengers travelling on a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cox |first=Simon |date=8 December 2011 |title=UK border staff in arrest threat over 'Lille loophole' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16058860 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> On the other hand, passengers boarding the same train in Brussels travelling on a ticket to the UK would be subject to exit checks leaving the Schengen Area and entry checks to the UK at the juxtaposed controls in Brussels-South station. This situation created a loophole (which was commonly referred to as the 'Lille loophole') whereby certain passengers who buy a train ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais and therefore not go through the juxtaposed controls before boarding the train in Brussels, but would remain on the train after Lille/Calais and continue to the UK, thereby leaving the Schengen Area and entering the UK without having undergone the proper border checks. A number of passengers were able to travel to the UK and claim asylum on arrival in the UK using this method.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/546809/An-Inspection-of-Juxtaposed-Controls_Aug_2013.pdf |title=An Inspection of Juxtaposed Controls (November 2012 - March 2013) |publisher=[[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration]] |date=8 August 2013 |access-date=28 March 2020 |at=paras 4.3-4.4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=8 December 2011 |title=Tighter checks pledged to close Eurostar 'loophole' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-16092647 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter this loophole came to light in December 2011, Eurostar initially suspended the sale of point to point Brussels to Lille/Calais tickets, while maintaining the sale of season tickets on this route. Subsequently, Eurostar resumed the sale of tickets, but restricted the sale of Brussels-Lille/Calais tickets to 3 daily services. Upon arrival at Lille, the number of Brussels-Lille tickets sold were reconciled with the total number of disembarkations. Security guards conducted ticket inspections on passengers before the trains arrived at Calais, where those without a valid ticket to the UK would be instructed to disembark. In addition to the pre-embarkation juxtaposed controls, the UK Border Force also checked the travel documents of passengers travelling on these 3 services on arrival at London St Pancras International station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmhaff/71/71.pdf |title=The work of the UK Border Agency (December 2011\u2013March 2012) |publisher=[[House of Commons]] [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] |at=Ev 61 |date=16 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2012-04-23/debates/1204237000932/ImmigrationEurostar |title=House of Lords Hansard for 23 April 2012, Volume 736 (Immigration: Eurostar) |publisher=[[House of Lords]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, Belgium and the UK signed an agreement clarifying that at the juxtaposed controls in Brussels-South station, 'Immigration controls performed by the United Kingdom are only permitted on passengers whose travel destination is stated to be within the United Kingdom'.

French Border Police officers have the power to carry firearms and to arrest and detain individuals in the immigration control zone in the Port of Dover.<ref name=\"2003 order\"/> On the other hand, the [[UK Border Force]] does not carry out routine exit checks at the Port of Dover. Instead, since April 2015, the ferry operator collects passengers' travel document information during the booking or check-in process, which it sends electronically to the UK Border Force.

Therefore, when travelling from France to [[Dover]], although ferry passengers have already gone through immigration checks before departure, when they arrive in the UK, they might still be stopped by customs officers for a customs inspection.

The Chief Inspector raised concerns about the routine practice of detaining people in caged escort vehicles that were in 'appalling condition, with ripped out seats' for 'prolonged periods' while awaiting the arrival of the French Border Police. Few of the detainees were interviewed and UK Border Force officers could not state the legal authority under which these detainees were held.

As a consequence, after the result of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], there were increased calls in France to scrap the Treaty of Le Touquet and end juxtaposed controls, including from the then French Presidential candidates [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] and [[Emmanuel Macron]], and from the [[List of the mayors of Calais|Mayor of Calais]], [[Natacha Bouchart]]. However, such calls have since receded, as political leaders in France and the UK have sought to reinforce their commitment to bilateral border cooperation (for example, by entering into the Sandhurst Treaty). At the same time, the Committee has noted that although the agreements establishing juxtaposed controls are 'not formally EU-dependent, the agreements underpinning bilateral border cooperation have undoubtedly been easier to sustain under the shared umbrella of EU membership'.<ref name=\"HL Paper 428\">{{cite web|title=48th Report of Session 2017\u201319 - Brexit: refugee protection and asylum policy (HL Paper 428) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/428/42806.htm#footnote-124-backlink |date=11 October 2019 |publisher=[[House of Lords]] [[European Union Committee]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom [[Brexit|ceased to be a member state of the European Union]].
