Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

Small numbers inhabit eastern [[Poland]] and the south-eastern part of [[Finland]].<ref>Substantial numbers (possibly several millions) of maghrebis of the former Ottoman colonies in North Africa are of Ottoman Turkish descent. [[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.<ref>''The Karakalpak Gene Pool'' (Spencer Wells, 2001); and discussion and conclusions at www.karakalpak.com/genetics.html</ref>\n\n'''Historical population:'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Turks mostly herded [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[horse]]s. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as ''s\u00fct'' (milk), ''yagh'' (butter), [[ayran]], ''[[kaymak|qaymaq]]'' (similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[Kumis|qi\u0305mi\u0305z]] (fermented mare's milk) and ''[[qurut]]'' (dried yoghurt).

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]]. The Turks in Turkey are over 60 million<!-- According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey) of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia, there were approximately 50 to 55 million ethnic Turks --><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/turkiye-deki-kurtlerin-sayisi--magazin-873452/|title=T\u00fcrkiye'deki K\u00fcrtlerin say\u0131s\u0131!|trans-title=The number of Kurds in Turkey!|language=tr|newspaper=[[Milliyet]]|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the [[Azerbaijanis]], numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran.\n\nIn the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] there are several Turkic national subdivisions,<ref>[http://www.sonsoftheconquerors.com/16501.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val* Across Central Asia], a New Bond Grows \u2013 Iron Curtain's Fall Has Spawned a Convergence for Descendants of Turkic Nomad Hordes</ref> including [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]], [[Khakassia]], [[Tuva]], [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]], the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[Karachayevo-Cherkessiya]]. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

This company, along with its subsidiary [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]], had a stranglehold on ship to shore communication. It operated much the way [[American Telephone and Telegraph]] operated until 1983, owning all of its own equipment and refusing to communicate with non-Marconi equipped ships. Many inventions improved the quality of radio, and amateurs experimented with uses of radio, thus the first seeds of broadcasting were planted. Around the turn of the century, the Slaby-Arco wireless system was developed by [[Adolf Slaby]] and [[Georg von Arco]] (later incorporated into [[Telefunken]]).\n[[File:Sp xmtr.png|right|thumb|333px|A [[spark-gap transmitter]] for generating radio frequency electromagnetic waves. Such devices served as the transmitters for most early wireless systems.]]\n* 24 December 1906: [[Reginald Fessenden]] used an [[Alexanderson alternator]] and rotary [[spark-gap transmitter]] to make the first radio audio broadcast, from [[Ocean Bluff-Brant Rock, Massachusetts|Brant Rock, Massachusetts]]. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing ''[[O Holy Night]]'' on the [[violin]] and reading a passage from the [[Bible]].\n* 1907: Marconi established the first permanent transatlantic wireless service from [[Clifden]], Ireland to [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia.\n* 1909: Marconi and [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for \"contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy\".\n* April 1909: [[Charles David Herrold]], an electronics instructor in [[San Jose, California]] constructed a broadcasting station. It used [[spark gap]] technology, but modulated the carrier frequency with the human voice, and later music. The station \"San Jose Calling\" (there were no call letters), continued in an unbroken lineage to eventually become today's [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] in San Francisco. Herrold, the son of a [[Santa Clara Valley]] farmer, coined the terms \"narrowcasting\" and \"broadcasting\", respectively to identify transmissions destined for a single receiver such as that on board a ship, and those transmissions destined for a general audience. (The term \"broadcasting\" had been used in farming to define the tossing of seed in all directions.) Charles Herrold did not claim to be the first to transmit the human voice, but he claimed to be the first to conduct \"broadcasting\". To help the radio signal to spread in all directions, he designed [[omnidirectional antenna]]s, which he mounted on the rooftops of various buildings in San Jose. Herrold also claims to be the first broadcaster to accept [[advertising]], although advertising generally involves paid announcements. He exchanged publicity for a local record store for records to play on his station.\n* 1910: The [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910|Wireless Ship Act]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]], requiring all ships of the United States traveling over two-hundred miles off the coast and carrying over fifty passengers to be equipped with wireless radio equipment with a range of one-hundred miles. The legislation was prompted by a shipping accident in 1909, where a single wireless operator saved the lives of 1200 people.<ref name=Slotten>{{cite book|title=Radio and Television Regulation: Broadcast Technology in the United States 1920\u20131960|author=Hugh Richard Slotten|pages=6\u20138|year=2000|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=0-8018-6450-X}}</ref>\n* 1912: The [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sank. While in distress, it contacted several other ships via wireless. After this, wireless telegraphy using spark-gap transmitters quickly became universal on large ships. The [[Radio Act of 1912]] required all seafaring vessels to maintain 24-hour radio watch and keep in contact with nearby ships and coastal radio stations.<ref name=Slotten />\n* 1913: [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] initiated duplex transatlantic wireless communication between North America and Europe for the first time, using receiver stations in [[Letterfrack]] Ireland, and [[Louisbourg, Nova Scotia]].\n* 1913: The [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] was convened and produced a treaty requiring shipboard radio stations to be manned 24 hours a day. A typical high-power spark gap was a rotating commutator with six to twelve contacts per wheel, nine inches to a foot wide, driven by about 2000 [[volt]]s DC. As the gaps made and broke contact, the radio wave was audible as a tone in a crystal set. The telegraph key often directly made and broke the 2000 volt supply. One side of the spark gap was directly connected to the antenna. Receivers with [[thermionic valve]]s became commonplace before spark-gap transmitters were replaced by continuous wave transmitters.\n\n==Audio broadcasting (1915 to 1950s)==\n[[File:Atwaterkent.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ad for an [[A.

Scripps]]'s [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]] received its commercial broadcasting license and started broadcasting. It has carried a regular schedule of programming to the present. Broadcasting was not yet supported by [[advertising]]. The stations owned by manufacturers and department stores were established to sell radios and those owned by newspapers to sell papers and express the opinions of the owners.\n* 31 August 1920: The first known radio news program was broadcast by station 8MK, the unlicensed predecessor of [[WWJ (AM)]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].\n* October 1920: [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] became the first US commercial broadcasting station to be licensed when it was granted call letters [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]]. (Their engineer [[Frank Conrad]] had been broadcasting from his own station since 1916.)\n* 1921: In Australia, Charles Maclurcan of [[2CM - an Australian pioneer broadcaster|2CM]] commenced broadcasting Sunday night [[classical music]] concerts on the [[long wave]] band (214&nbsp;kHz.), using seven watts. 2CM was issued with the first broadcasting licence in Australia (Licence No.1, signed by Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes|William Morris (''Billy'') Hughes]],) in December 1922. However, many current historian recognise 2SB as the first official broadcaster in Australia, in 1923.\n* 26 February 1922: In [[California]], [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] transmitted his first radio Bible sermon. \n* 1922: Regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the [[UK]] from the [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] Research Centre at [[Writtle]] near [[Chelmsford, England]]. Early radios ran the entire power of the transmitter through a carbon microphone.\n* 23 November 1923: [[2BL (AM)|2SB]] was the first Australian station to be '''officially''' recognised.\n*23 May 1925 : First broadcast in Tbilisi, Georgia. \n* Mid 1920s:\n** [[Amplifier|Amplifying]] [[vacuum tube]]s revolutionized [[radio receiver]]s and [[transmitter]]s; Westinghouse engineers improved them. (Before that, the most common type of receiver was the [[crystal radio receiver|crystal set]], although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery.)\n** Inventions of the [[triode amplifier]], [[Electrical generator|generator]], and [[detector]] enabled audio radio.\n** [[Reginald Fessenden|Fessenden]] and [[Lee de Forest]] pioneered the invention of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude-modulated]] radio ('''AM radio'''), so more than one station can send signals (as opposed to spark-gap radio, where one transmitter covers the entire bandwidth of spectra). [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] bought [[Lee De Forest|DeForest]]'s and [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Armstrong]]'s patent.\n* 1920s: Radio was first used to transmit pictures visible as [[television]].\n* Early 1930s: [[Single sideband]] (SSB) and [[frequency modulation]] (FM) were invented by amateur radio operators. By 1940, they were established commercial modes.\n\nWestinghouse was brought into the patent allies group, [[General Electric]], [[American Telephone and Telegraph]], and [[Radio Corporation of America]], and became a part owner of RCA. All radios made by GE and Westinghouse were sold under the RCA label 60% GE and 40% Westinghouse. ATT's Western Electric would build radio transmitters. The patent allies attempted to set up a monopoly, but they failed due to successful competition. Much to the dismay of the patent allies, several of the contracts for inventor's patents held clauses protecting \"amateurs\" and allowing them to use the patents. Whether the competing manufacturers were really amateurs was ignored by these competitors.\n\n{|align=\"right\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:333px;border:solid 0px;background:none|\n[[File:Seal of the United States Federal Communications Commission.svg|thumb|right|144px|[[Federal Communications Commission]].]]\n|\n[[File:Federal radio commission.gif|right|222px|thumb|[[Federal Radio Commission]].]]\n|}\nThese features arose:\n* Commercial ([[United States]]; governmental ([[Europe]]) station networks; or a dual system, firstly in [[History of broadcasting|Australia]] in 1924 and in Canada in 1932.\n* [[Federal Radio Commission]]\n* [[Federal Communications Commission]]\n* Race towards shorter waves and FM\n* 1933: [[FM radio]] was patented; [[Edwin Armstrong|Edwin H.

Because of the recent war, Germany (which was not even invited) was only given a few medium-wave frequencies, which are not very good for broadcasting. For this reason Germany began broadcasting on USW, \"ultra short wave\" (nowadays called VHF). After some [[amplitude modulation]] experience with VHF, it was realized that FM radio was a much better alternative for VHF radio than AM.\n\n==Later 20th-century developments==\n* 1954: Regency introduced a pocket [[transistor]] radio, the [[Regency TR-1|TR-1]], powered by a \"standard 22.5V Battery\".\n* 1960: [[Sony]] introduced their first transistorized radio, small enough to fit in a vest pocket, and able to be powered by a small battery. It was durable, because there were no tubes to burn out. Over the next twenty years, transistors displaced tubes almost completely except for very high power or very high frequency uses.\n* Early 1960s: [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] systems finally became widespread; before that, [[aircraft]] used commercial AM radio stations for navigation. (AM stations are still marked on U.S. [[aviation]] charts).\n* 1963: Color television was commercially transmitted, and the first (radio) [[communication satellite]], TELSTAR, was launched.\n* In the late 1960s, the U.S. long-distance telephone network began to convert to a digital network, employing [[digital radio]]s for many of its links.\n* 1970s: [[LORAN]] became the premier radio navigation system. Soon, the U.S. Navy experimented with [[satellite navigation]].\n* 1987: The [[GPS]] constellation of satellites was launched.\n* Early 1990s: [[Amateur radio]] experimenters began to use personal computers with audio cards to process radio signals.\n* 1994: The U.S. Army and [[DARPA]] launched an aggressive successful project to construct a [[software radio]] that could become a different radio on the fly by changing software.\n* Late 1990s: The [[Digital data|digital]] transmissions began to be applied to broadcasting.\n\n===Telex on radio===\n[[Telegraphy]] did not go away on radio. Instead, the degree of automation increased. On land-lines in the 1930s, [[Teletypewriter]]s automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called [[teleprinter|telex]]. For thirty years, telex was the absolute cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.\n\nTelex systems were adapted to short-wave radio by sending tones over [[single sideband]]. [[ITU-T|CCITT]] R.44 (the most advanced pure-telex standard) incorporated character-level error detection and retransmission as well as automated encoding and routing. For many years, telex-on-radio (TOR) was the only reliable way to reach some third-world countries. TOR remains reliable, though less-expensive forms of e-mail are displacing it. Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure telex networks for their governments, and they ran many of these links over short wave radio.\n\n==21st-century development==\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\n\n*2015: It was reported that Cambridge Consultants had developed the first fully digital radio transmitter, followed by the first digital radio receiver in 2016.

This company, along with its subsidiary [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]], had a stranglehold on ship to shore communication. It operated much the way [[American Telephone and Telegraph]] operated until 1983, owning all of its own equipment and refusing to communicate with non-Marconi equipped ships. Many inventions improved the quality of radio, and amateurs experimented with uses of radio, thus the first seeds of broadcasting were planted. Around the turn of the century, the Slaby-Arco wireless system was developed by [[Adolf Slaby]] and [[Georg von Arco]] (later incorporated into [[Telefunken]]).\n[[File:Sp xmtr.png|right|thumb|333px|A [[spark-gap transmitter]] for generating radio frequency electromagnetic waves. Such devices served as the transmitters for most early wireless systems.]]\n* 24 December 1906: [[Reginald Fessenden]] used an [[Alexanderson alternator]] and rotary [[spark-gap transmitter]] to make the first radio audio broadcast, from [[Ocean Bluff-Brant Rock, Massachusetts|Brant Rock, Massachusetts]]. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing ''[[O Holy Night]]'' on the [[violin]] and reading a passage from the [[Bible]].\n* 1907: Marconi established the first permanent transatlantic wireless service from [[Clifden]], Ireland to [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia.\n* 1909: Marconi and [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for \"contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy\".\n* April 1909: [[Charles David Herrold]], an electronics instructor in [[San Jose, California]] constructed a broadcasting station. It used [[spark gap]] technology, but modulated the carrier frequency with the human voice, and later music. The station \"San Jose Calling\" (there were no call letters), continued in an unbroken lineage to eventually become today's [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] in San Francisco. Herrold, the son of a [[Santa Clara Valley]] farmer, coined the terms \"narrowcasting\" and \"broadcasting\", respectively to identify transmissions destined for a single receiver such as that on board a ship, and those transmissions destined for a general audience. (The term \"broadcasting\" had been used in farming to define the tossing of seed in all directions.) Charles Herrold did not claim to be the first to transmit the human voice, but he claimed to be the first to conduct \"broadcasting\". To help the radio signal to spread in all directions, he designed [[omnidirectional antenna]]s, which he mounted on the rooftops of various buildings in San Jose. Herrold also claims to be the first broadcaster to accept [[advertising]], although advertising generally involves paid announcements. He exchanged publicity for a local record store for records to play on his station.\n* 1910: The [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910|Wireless Ship Act]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]], requiring all ships of the United States traveling over two-hundred miles off the coast and carrying over fifty passengers to be equipped with wireless radio equipment with a range of one-hundred miles. The legislation was prompted by a shipping accident in 1909, where a single wireless operator saved the lives of 1200 people.<ref name=Slotten>{{cite book|title=Radio and Television Regulation: Broadcast Technology in the United States 1920\u20131960|author=Hugh Richard Slotten|pages=6\u20138|year=2000|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=0-8018-6450-X}}</ref>\n* 1912: The [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sank. While in distress, it contacted several other ships via wireless. After this, wireless telegraphy using spark-gap transmitters quickly became universal on large ships.

A typical high-power spark gap was a rotating commutator with six to twelve contacts per wheel, nine inches to a foot wide, driven by about 2000 [[volt]]s DC. As the gaps made and broke contact, the radio wave was audible as a tone in a crystal set. The telegraph key often directly made and broke the 2000 volt supply. One side of the spark gap was directly connected to the antenna. Receivers with [[thermionic valve]]s became commonplace before spark-gap transmitters were replaced by continuous wave transmitters.\n\n==Audio broadcasting (1915 to 1950s)==\n[[File:Atwaterkent.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ad for an [[A.

(Before that, the most common type of receiver was the [[crystal radio receiver|crystal set]], although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery.)\n** Inventions of the [[triode amplifier]], [[Electrical generator|generator]], and [[detector]] enabled audio radio.\n** [[Reginald Fessenden|Fessenden]] and [[Lee de Forest]] pioneered the invention of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude-modulated]] radio ('''AM radio'''), so more than one station can send signals (as opposed to spark-gap radio, where one transmitter covers the entire bandwidth of spectra). [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] bought [[Lee De Forest|DeForest]]'s and [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Armstrong]]'s patent.\n* 1920s: Radio was first used to transmit pictures visible as [[television]].\n* Early 1930s: [[Single sideband]] (SSB) and [[frequency modulation]] (FM) were invented by amateur radio operators. By 1940, they were established commercial modes.\n\nWestinghouse was brought into the patent allies group, [[General Electric]], [[American Telephone and Telegraph]], and [[Radio Corporation of America]], and became a part owner of RCA. All radios made by GE and Westinghouse were sold under the RCA label 60% GE and 40% Westinghouse. ATT's Western Electric would build radio transmitters. The patent allies attempted to set up a monopoly, but they failed due to successful competition. Much to the dismay of the patent allies, several of the contracts for inventor's patents held clauses protecting \"amateurs\" and allowing them to use the patents. Whether the competing manufacturers were really amateurs was ignored by these competitors.\n\n{|align=\"right\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:333px;border:solid 0px;background:none|\n[[File:Seal of the United States Federal Communications Commission.svg|thumb|right|144px|[[Federal Communications Commission]].]]\n|\n[[File:Federal radio commission.gif|right|222px|thumb|[[Federal Radio Commission]].]]\n|}\nThese features arose:\n* Commercial ([[United States]]; governmental ([[Europe]]) station networks; or a dual system, firstly in [[History of broadcasting|Australia]] in 1924 and in Canada in 1932.\n* [[Federal Radio Commission]]\n* [[Federal Communications Commission]]\n* Race towards shorter waves and FM\n* 1933: [[FM radio]] was patented; [[Edwin Armstrong|Edwin H. Armstrong]] invented it. FM uses [[frequency modulation]] of the radio wave to minimize [[White noise|static]] and [[Radio frequency interference|interference]] from electrical equipment and the atmosphere, in the audio program.\n* 1937: [[W1XOJ]], the first experimental FM radio station, was granted a construction permit by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).\n* 1940s: Standard analog television transmissions started in North America and Europe.\n* 1943: the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in a case on radio patents involving the U.S. government vs the Marconi Company, restores some of the prior patents of [[Oliver Lodge]], [[John Stone Stone]], and [[Nicola Tesla]].<ref name=\"LQsxMxEUC page 3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c92LQsxMxEUC&pg=PA3 |author1 = Jean-Michel Redout\u00e9|author2 = Michiel Steyaert|title = EMC of Analog Integrated Circuits|page= 3 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-3230-0|date=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/makingconnection00mead|url-access=registration|title=Making Connections: Communication Through the Ages|year=2002|author=Charles T.

Because of the recent war, Germany (which was not even invited) was only given a few medium-wave frequencies, which are not very good for broadcasting. For this reason Germany began broadcasting on USW, \"ultra short wave\" (nowadays called VHF). After some [[amplitude modulation]] experience with VHF, it was realized that FM radio was a much better alternative for VHF radio than AM.\n\n==Later 20th-century developments==\n* 1954: Regency introduced a pocket [[transistor]] radio, the [[Regency TR-1|TR-1]], powered by a \"standard 22.5V Battery\".\n* 1960: [[Sony]] introduced their first transistorized radio, small enough to fit in a vest pocket, and able to be powered by a small battery. It was durable, because there were no tubes to burn out. Over the next twenty years, transistors displaced tubes almost completely except for very high power or very high frequency uses.\n* Early 1960s: [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] systems finally became widespread; before that, [[aircraft]] used commercial AM radio stations for navigation. (AM stations are still marked on U.S. [[aviation]] charts).\n* 1963: Color television was commercially transmitted, and the first (radio) [[communication satellite]], TELSTAR, was launched.\n* In the late 1960s, the U.S. long-distance telephone network began to convert to a digital network, employing [[digital radio]]s for many of its links.\n* 1970s: [[LORAN]] became the premier radio navigation system. Soon, the U.S. Navy experimented with [[satellite navigation]].\n* 1987: The [[GPS]] constellation of satellites was launched.\n* Early 1990s: [[Amateur radio]] experimenters began to use personal computers with audio cards to process radio signals.\n* 1994: The U.S. Army and [[DARPA]] launched an aggressive successful project to construct a [[software radio]] that could become a different radio on the fly by changing software.\n* Late 1990s: The [[Digital data|digital]] transmissions began to be applied to broadcasting.\n\n===Telex on radio===\n[[Telegraphy]] did not go away on radio. Instead, the degree of automation increased. On land-lines in the 1930s, [[Teletypewriter]]s automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called [[teleprinter|telex]]. For thirty years, telex was the absolute cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.\n\nTelex systems were adapted to short-wave radio by sending tones over [[single sideband]]. [[ITU-T|CCITT]] R.44 (the most advanced pure-telex standard) incorporated character-level error detection and retransmission as well as automated encoding and routing. For many years, telex-on-radio (TOR) was the only reliable way to reach some third-world countries. TOR remains reliable, though less-expensive forms of e-mail are displacing it. Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure telex networks for their governments, and they ran many of these links over short wave radio.\n\n==21st-century development==\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\n\n*2015: It was reported that Cambridge Consultants had developed the first fully digital radio transmitter, followed by the first digital radio receiver in 2016. As a result of [[technological innovation]], the microprocessor is becoming powerful enough that the physical components inside a radio can be replaced with software. A software radio can be downloaded to smartphones and computers, instead of being integrated in the hardware.<ref>[https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/press-releases/first-all-digital-radio-transmitter First all-digital radio transmitter | Cambridge Consultants]</ref><ref>[https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/press-releases/pizzicato-comes-age Pizzicato comes of age | Cambridge Consultants]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of radio]]\n* [[Timeline of the introduction of radio in countries]]\n* [[History of broadcasting]]\n* [[List of oldest radio stations]]\n* [[Birth of public radio broadcasting]]\n* [[History of broadcasting in Australia]]\n* [[Timeline of Australian radio]]\n* [[Broadcasting in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://jeff560.tripod.com/chrono1.html A Chronology of AM Radio Broadcasting 1900\u20131960]\n* [http://ns1763.ca/radio30/radio-first-30yrs.html Timeline of the First Thirty Years of Radio 1895\u20131925]\n* [http://www.patent-invent.com/radio_patents.html Radio & Wireless Victorian Patents] \u2013 presented in a chronological order with short descriptions.\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Culture-related timelines|Radio]]\n[[Category:History of radio]]\n[[Category:Radio by year]]\n[[Category:Radio timelines| ]]\n", "name_user": "67.142.100.182", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_radio"}

On 17 April 2020, the launch date was confirmed to be 27 May. The arrival of the Crew Dragon will raise the station's crew size from three to five for several months. \"Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will go up as not just demonstration pilots for Demo-2, but they would actually become crew on-board the International Space Station for a period of months to do work, and they would continue to operate on the ISS\", Bridenstine said. \"And then when we're ready with the next Crew Dragon, they'll come home\".

The district operates one High School (9th\u201312th), one Middle School (7th\u20138th), two Intermediate Schools (5th\u20136th) and five Elementary Schools (K-4th).\n\n==District information==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=May 2019}}\nThe Canon-McMillan School District is the largest school district in Washington County in terms of enrollment, and the size of its student body is increasing annually. On average, the high school receives around a hundred new students each school year. Enrollment has been increasing at this rate for about a decade, and is projected to continue doing so as long as the local economy continues to flourish. Canon-McMillan is in class AAAAAA (6A) [[WPIAL]] for most of its athletic programs. The district's mascot is the \"Big Mac\", similar to another common mascot called a Highlander, which is typically displayed as a soldier of a Scottish regiment. Canon-McMillan's school colors are blue and gold, while the alternate colors are white and black. The district is predominantly suburban, and also serves rural portions of [[North Strabane Township]] near the town of Eighty Four and the semi-rural area southwest of the Allegheny County line in [[Cecil Township, Washington County]]. The school district borders the South Fayette Twp. School District and Upper Saint Clair Schools (both in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]]) to the north and northeast respectively. In Washington County, the district adjoins both Peters Twp. and Ringgold School Districts to the east, Chartiers-Houston to the west, Fort Cherry to the northwest, Trinity Area School District to the southwest, and Bentworth Schools to the southeast.\n\n===Athletics=== \nAthletically, Canon-Mac has been known as a wrestling powerhouse for decades. Most recently, the school has also been known for its boys basketball program and as WPIAL and PA state powers in boys and girls soccer. Their Varsity Girls Soccer team won the PIAA AAAA State Championship in 2016 and was State runner- up in 2014. Boys soccer won WPIAL championships in 2012, 2015, and 2019.  Their Varsity softball team won the PIAA State Championship in 2013, and WPIAL Championship in 2012 & 2013. Their varsity girls volleyball team won their first ever WPIAL championship in 2019, upsetting heavily favored North Allegheny in the finals.  Their Varsity baseball team won the [[PIAA]] State Championship in both 2008 and 2018 as well as their first ever WPIAL championship in 2018. Their varsity hockey team won the [[Penguins Cup]] in 2010 and 2015. The boys basketball team had its best season in school history at the time in 2018, with 19 straight wins and a 21\u20132 overall record. The team's winning streak unfortunately came to an end with a loss to Baldwin, and the season ended with a loss to Woodland Hills in the WPIAL semi-finals, preventing Canon-Mac from moving on to the finals, however, the season still added to the school's long legacy of athletic success. The team topped their own record from the previous year in 2019, becoming WPIAL section champions with only one regular season loss and reaching the WPIAL finals. Despite losing the final game to City League section champions Taylor Allderdice, the season still went down as one of Canon-Mac's greatest athletic feats. The school's wrestling team has won [[WPIAL]] titles in 1983, 1985, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2012, the wrestling team took home their 1st [[PIAA]] State dual meet Championship Title in the school's history before winning the state championship again in 2013. In 1992, 2011, 2012 and 2013, members of the team won the State Individual Tournament team championship by collecting the most points.\n\n===Transportation===\nTransportation in the Canon-McMillan School District is provided mainly by [[school bus]]. The district also operates a small number of school vans and short buses (mostly for students that are physically [[handicapped]] and/or suffer from severe [[mental disabilities]], as well as students with behavioral or emotional issues that may cause disruption on a typical school bus.) Most van and short bus services are provided by third-party transit contractors. The school district is also legally bound by the state to provide transportation to [[private academies]] and [[parochial schools]] lying within its service zone. The Canon-Mac full size bus fleet is composed almost entirely of [[Blue Bird Vision]] school buses; second and third generations; built from 2008\u2013present. The district also has about ten-first generation Visions; built from 2003 to 2007; most of which remain in route service currently, but are soon to be retired. Among other buses retained by the district, two Thomas bodied [[Freightliner FS-65]]s (buses 10 and 31) remain in route service, alongside at least five of their newer counterparts, the [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2]] buses, ordered by the district during the 2012 and 2015\u20132017 model years. Two to four more full size FS-65s no longer in route service are kept at the Support Facility as backup buses for situations when route buses may not be operable for some reason. The district also began to add [[IC Bus|IC CE]] school buses to its fleet in 2019. Other student transport vehicles of the district include [[Ford E-Series]] passenger vans, [[Ford Transit]] passenger vans, [[Thomas Minotour]] short buses based upon Ford E-Series chassis, and short Thomas Conventional buses on either Freightliner FS-65 or [[International 3800]] chassis. The district fleet once included [[Blue Bird TC/2000]] type D buses, however these have all been retired and sold off. Several Blue Bird bodied full size International 3800s have been sold by the district as well, and only one of these buses remains today, repainted and with stop sign, warning lights, passenger windows, and most passenger seats removed. This bus serves primarily as an equipment transporter for the high school band and rarely travels with passengers aboard.\n\n==School buildings and other facilities==\nThe Canon-McMillan School District contains nine academic school buildings and three athletic complexes that are separate from the schools, as well as a school bus garage and a central administration building.\n\n===High school===\n'''Canon-McMillan High School''' is the largest school building in the district, both geographically and by student population. Currently, about 2,000 students in grades 9\u201312 attend CMHS. The school was originally built and opened as Canon-McMillan Senior High School in 1958 with grades 10\u201312, and has been expanded and renovated in 1966, 1983, 1988, 1994, 2001\u20132003, and 2017\u20132019. CMHS has two gymnasiums (Main and Auxiliary), a [[natatorium]], a weight room, and a mat room for wrestling practice as its athletic facilities. The school also has four outdoor tennis courts and formerly had an open playing field and outdoor exercise yard on its premises. An auditorium is also featured.\n\n The 1966 and 1983 extensions to CMHS both added additional classrooms, and the school's name was changed from Canon-McMillan Senior High to just Canon-McMillan High School in 1983. This was due to the district's reorganization plan which called for the 9th grade to be moved to the high school and for the junior high schools (which became middle schools at that point in time) to take on the 6th graders. The 1983 project also renovated the interior of the entire existing building, added seats to the auditorium, and reconfigured the athletic wing by replacing the original gym with a larger one that contained pull-out bleachers and an elevated walking track. The auxiliary gym, weight room, and mat room were added in 1988, and some other minor floor plan modifications were also made to other parts of the school at that time. The restrooms and locker rooms in that part of the building were remodeled and slightly modified in 1994. \n\nThe 2001\u20132003 project was the longest and most major renovation in the school's history. This project completely demolished and rebuilt the school's academic wings, added more parking, and moved the library, cafeteria, kitchen, and teacher's lounge closer to the school's entrances. A centrally located commons area with high vaulted ceilings; known as the Atrium; was also created during this time. Some minor repainting took place in both gyms, and the wood flooring of both was replaced. A press box and more pull-out collapsible bleachers were added to the main gym above the elevated track, and the exercise yard was eliminated as it was in the way of the new set of loading docks and part of the new classroom portion of the school. The natatorium was also built in this area, and has two entrances off of the hallway in the athletic wing. The performing arts and technology wing was also expanded, and the original loading docks, which were located at the end of that wing, became secondary loading docks. The main entrance to the school was modernized and the doors pushed about 8 feet forward, and most of the building's front fascia was re-bricked to give a more clean and updated appearance. A large digital sign was also added to the front of the school as part of the project. In total, about 90 percent of the original building was either renovated or replaced, and the entire student and staff populations benefited from the project. It would effectively relieve severe overcrowding at CMHS for the next 8 years, and increase student capacity from barely 1,200 students to around 1,500 students. The student body would continue to grow, however, and by 2011, the enrollment at the school had exceeded the 1,500 student maximum. \n\nThe school would remain overcrowded until 2017, when a new classroom extension was begun. Both academic wings were extended back, and the parking lot that used to be behind them was removed. The open playing field off of the athletic wing was paved over and made into a new lot to make up for lost parking area. Brand new Jumbotron-style scoreboards were installed in the main gym, along with revamped signage on the press box and outside of the doors. The auditorium was also remodeled with fresh paint, new ceilings, all new seats, and the expansion of the stage and backstage areas. New, better lighting systems and brand new acoustic wall panels were also installed, and the total [[seating capacity]] was significantly increased. The band room was nearly doubled in size and also received acoustic panels and other sound mitigation improvements. The teacher's lounge was again relocated, due to the cafeteria being expanded into its former location, and a [[security vestibule]] was added to the main office entrance. The reception portion of the office was remodeled and reconfigured to accommodate the new feature. Most building work and all major parts of the project concluded in February 2019. Some minor cosmetic landscaping work continued into the summer of 2019.\n\n===Intermediate/middle schools===\n'''Canonsburg Middle School''' is currently the only middle school in the Canon-McMillan School District and educates students in 7th and 8th grades. Present enrollment numbers around 1,100 students. It also houses the district-wide Special Education department offices, and is one of few Pittsburgh area middle schools that has never previously served as a high school to feature a natatorium.\n\nIt opened in 1967 as Canon-McMillan Junior High School, and was built on the former site of the original Canonsburg High School, demolished a few years earlier. The original school's historic auditorium still remains as a freestanding building however, initially dating back to the 1920s, and still in use for school and community functions to this day. In 1967, Canon-McMillan Junior High held students in grades 7\u20139. It was the second junior high school in the district, after Cecil Junior High (now Cecil Intermediate) opened four years earlier in 1963.\n\nCanon-McMillan Junior High became the grades 6\u20138 Canonsburg Middle School in 1983, and would see its first and only complete renovation the next year, in 1984. This project remodeled the structure's entire interior (with the exception of the auditorium, which is historically preserved), and updated electrical and plumbing work to meet the safety codes of the time. Computer labs and a large group instruction room were added in the 90s, however the latter has since been removed and permanently divided into three classrooms. 6th grade was removed from CMS in 2002. The school saw minor security upgrades near the main entrance in 2014, however, CMS is now slated to close in the coming years as the building's structural and physical condition is deteriorating, and having not seen a full renovation since the 80s, the school is extremely dated inside. Cracks and chips have formed in staircases and floor tiles over the years, mostly due to old age and prolonged wear and tear.\n\nCMS has also been severely overcrowded for several years. At most times, students cannot walk through its halls without encountering very heavy foot traffic. They will, however, be transferred to an all new school building that, as of 2018, has not yet been constructed, but is expected to be built and opened by 2021 at a new location and will have a larger student capacity than the current school. The name of the new building is currently to be determined, and the facility may or may not be called Canonsburg Middle School. The present-day building cannot be effectively expanded due to property space constraints and an overall original design and layout that did not take future wings and additions into consideration. The aforementioned auditorium will likely remain as-is, despite the school building's currently unknown fate after closure. Unconfirmed local rumors indicate that the building, if not demolished, may be either acquired by a church and converted into a religious school, or remodeled into apartment homes for senior citizens.\n\n'''Cecil Intermediate School''' is one of two intermediate schools in the Canon-McMillan School District and currently holds around 500 students in grades 5 and 6. The school opened in 1963 as Cecil Junior High School and as mentioned in the previous paragraph, originally taught students in the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. Beginning in 1983, the school held grades 6\u20138 and had its name changed to Cecil Middle School and finally, in 2002, 5th grade was added and grades 7 and 8 were dropped, and the school became the Cecil Intermediate School of today.\n\n'''North Strabane Intermediate School''' is the second intermediate school in the district and has a student body of around 550. It accommodates grades 5 and 6 and is the second newest school building in the district. The site next to Borland Manor Elementary was cleared in 2000 and the school opened in 2002, although it was not fully completed until 2003. There are also multiple baseball/softball fields with permanent dugouts, a small press building and digital scoreboards outside of the school, used for competition as well as softball practice.\n\n===Elementary schools===\n'''Borland Manor Elementary School''' is one of five current elementary schools in the Canon-McMillan School District. The school is home to around 320 students in grades K-4. It was built in 1968 as new housing was developed in the area and is adjacent to North Strabane Intermediate School (details above). The school was partially remodeled in the early 90s, but its condition has unfortunately once again declined since then.\n\n'''Hills-Hendersonville Elementary School''' teaches about 300 students in Kindergarten through 4th grade. The school opened in 1965 and an expansion is planned in the years ahead, as the school is currently operating at maximum capacity, however the exact dates of the project have not yet been determined. Minor renovations and visual updates took place in 2012.\n\n'''Muse Elementary School''' enrolls around 730 students in grades K-4. The current facility is the newest school building in the Canon-McMillan School District as of 2018. Muse is also the largest elementary school in the district by enrollment. The current building replaced the original Muse Elementary, which was built in 1936 and razed upon completion of the new school in 2017. The current school is a consolidation of the now closed Cecil and First Street Elementary Schools (which opened in 1936 and 1924 respectively) into the Muse facility. The new school is more than 4 times the size of its predecessor geographically.\n\n'''South Central Elementary School''' currently has a student body numbering about 470 pupils in grades K-4. The school opened in 1973 and was renovated and expanded in 1995. The project included interior repainting, minor floor plan alterations, remodeling of the library and main office, and the addition of windows to all classrooms with walls to the outside. A scientific plant growing lab/greenhouse, still one of only two in the district, was also added to the school at that time.\n\n'''Wylandville Elementary School''' is the oldest operational school building in the district as of 2018. The school opened to students in 1951 and is currently populated by about 220 students in grades K-4, making it the smallest school in the district by enrollment. Wylandville was last renovated in 1979 and is to be overhauled in the next few years, as age, decay, and outdatedness have taken their toll on the current building significantly. Project dates are undisclosed at this time. It is also home to the district's second greenhouse, known as the \"Living Classroom\".\n\n===Other facilities===\n'''Big Mac Stadium''' serves as the Canon-McMillan School District's main athletic facility. It was initially built up as a formal stadium in the 1970s, however, the grounds that it occupies have been used for athletic events since the 1930s. The stadium is sometimes also called Canon-McMillan Stadium or Canonsburg Stadium. It recently underwent renovations to expand seating areas and add new locker rooms and more parking. It had its running track resurfaced and artificial turf replaced in 2016. The stadium received artificial turf for the first time in 1998, which was when the last major renovation prior to the most recent one occurred. It is located just off Jefferson Avenue near the heart of Canonsburg, and is adjacent to the district's Central Administration building.\n\n'''McDowell Field''' is the district's primary baseball practice complex, named for the road on which it is located. Besides a baseball diamond, the site also contains multipurpose playing fields and service buildings which house locker rooms, restrooms, a concession stand, a press room, and the controls for the scoreboard.\n\n'''West McMurray Road Soccer Complex''', alternatively known as '''Van Eman Field''', is a triangular grass field divided into several small soccer pitches and serves as a practice field for the Canon-McMillan Youth Soccer Association, the district league for boys and girls soccer at the elementary school level. The de facto name Van Eman Field comes from Van Eman Creek, which runs near the site. The entire field is fenced in. There is a North Strabane Township municipal pump station on the premises, which is fenced off separately from the field itself to prevent unauthorized access. The site does not have any permanent buildings besides a basic wooden shelter that are accessible to its users, as portable toilets and a utility trailer are only used at the field seasonally.\n\n'''Canon-McMillan Support Facility''' serves as both the district's school bus/school van garage and the headquarters for the district-wide maintenance and custodial department. It is a large, aircraft hangar-like building providing indoor parking and maintenance space for most of the district's buses, vans, and maintenance vehicles, with an attached annex designated for offices and the service and repair shop. It was built in 1990 and is diagonally across the street from the high school.\n\n'''Canon-McMillan Central Administration Building''' holds the School Board offices, meeting room, Superintendent's office, Assistant Superintendent's office, and all district-wide department offices, with the exception of the Special Education and Maintenance/ Custodial departments. It was built in the 1970s and is in front of Big Mac Stadium on Jefferson Ave.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=May 2019}}\nThe Canon-McMillan School District was founded on September 15, 1954 in a merger between the Canonsburg, Cecil Township, and North Strabane Township schools. Canon-McMillan High School was formerly known as Canonsburg High school and Cecil High School when the name was changed. The high school moved to its current location in 1958. The district is named for Col. [[John Canon]] and the Rev. [[John McMillan (missionary)|John McMillan]]. [[John McMillan's Log School]]; which dates back to the 1780s, is located outside the present day Canonsburg Middle School.\n\n==Comprehensive list of schools==\nThe Canon-McMillan School District operates a total of nine schools:\n* Canon-McMillan High School\n* Canonsburg Middle School\n* North Strabane Intermediate School\n* Cecil Intermediate School\n* Borland Manor Elementary School\n* Hills-Hendersonville Elementary School\n* Muse Elementary School\n* South Central Elementary School\n* Wylandville Elementary School\nThere are also two former schools in the district that closed on June 1, 2017 after Muse Elementary was completely overhauled and expanded:\n*  First Street Elementary School \n*  Cecil Elementary School\nA third defunct school, [[Hawthorne School (Canonsburg, Pennsylvania)|Hawthorne Elementary School]], closed in 1982 due to declining district wide enrollment at the time.

Students remain enrolled at their high school. The credits count towards high school graduation requirements, and towards earning a college degree, in both this program and the school-funded program mentioned above.

Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Referendum Exceptions Taxpayer Relief Act |year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Canon-McMillan School District 2006\u20132007 through 2010\u20132011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/property_tax_reduction_allocations/510335 |title=Property Tax Reduction Allocations |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011}}</ref>\n\n* 2006\u201307 \u2013 4.7%, Base 3.9%\n* 2007\u201308 \u2013 4.1%, Base 3.4%\n* 2008\u201309 \u2013 5.3%, Base 4.4%\n* 2009\u201310 \u2013 5.0%, Base 4.1%\n* 2010\u201311 \u2013 3.5%, Base 2.9%\n* 2011\u201312 \u2013 1.7%, Base 1.4%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-38/1760.html |title=Index Calculation Required by the Taxpayer Relief Act Sept 18 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Data Elements}}</ref>\n* 2012\u201313 \u2013 2.1%, Base \u2013 1.7%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=The Index Special Session Act 1 of 2006 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2011\u201312 school year, the Canon-McMillan School Board sought 2 exceptions: special education costs and pension costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |title=Adjusted Index History |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2011}}</ref> For the district's 2010\u201311 budget year, the Canon-McMillan School Board did not seek exceptions to the Index limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Referendum Exceptions for 2010\u20132011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Referendum Exceptions for 2009\u20132010 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\nEach year, the school district has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February.

On average, the high school receives around a hundred new students each school year. Enrollment has been increasing at this rate for about a decade, and is projected to continue doing so as long as the local economy continues to flourish. Canon-McMillan is in class AAAAAA (6A) [[WPIAL]] for most of its athletic programs. The district's mascot is the \"Big Mac\", similar to another common mascot called a Highlander, which is typically displayed as a soldier of a Scottish regiment. Canon-McMillan's school colors are blue and gold, while the alternate colors are white and black. The district is predominantly suburban, and also serves rural portions of [[North Strabane Township]] near the town of Eighty Four and the semi-rural area southwest of the Allegheny County line in [[Cecil Township, Washington County]]. The school district borders the South Fayette Twp. School District and Upper Saint Clair Schools (both in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]]) to the north and northeast respectively. In Washington County, the district adjoins both Peters Twp. and Ringgold School Districts to the east, Chartiers-Houston to the west, Fort Cherry to the northwest, Trinity Area School District to the southwest, and Bentworth Schools to the southeast.\n\n===Athletics=== \nAthletically, Canon-Mac has been known as a wrestling powerhouse for decades. Most recently, the school has also been known for its boys basketball program and as WPIAL and PA state powers in boys and girls soccer. Their Varsity Girls Soccer team won the PIAA AAAA State Championship in 2016 and was State runner- up in 2014. Boys soccer won WPIAL championships in 2012, 2015, and 2019.  Their Varsity softball team won the PIAA State Championship in 2013, and WPIAL Championship in 2012 & 2013. Their varsity girls volleyball team won their first ever WPIAL championship in 2019, upsetting heavily favored North Allegheny in the finals.  Their Varsity baseball team won the [[PIAA]] State Championship in both 2008 and 2018 as well as their first ever WPIAL championship in 2018. Their varsity hockey team won the [[Penguins Cup]] in 2010 and 2015. The boys basketball team had its best season in school history at the time in 2018, with 19 straight wins and a 21\u20132 overall record. The team's winning streak unfortunately came to an end with a loss to Baldwin, and the season ended with a loss to Woodland Hills in the WPIAL semi-finals, preventing Canon-Mac from moving on to the finals, however, the season still added to the school's long legacy of athletic success. The team topped their own record from the previous year in 2019, becoming WPIAL section champions with only one regular season loss and reaching the WPIAL finals. Despite losing the final game to City League section champions Taylor Allderdice, the season still went down as one of Canon-Mac's greatest athletic feats. The school's wrestling team has won [[WPIAL]] titles in 1983, 1985, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2012, the wrestling team took home their 1st [[PIAA]] State dual meet Championship Title in the school's history before winning the state championship again in 2013. In 1992, 2011, 2012 and 2013, members of the team won the State Individual Tournament team championship by collecting the most points.\n\n===Transportation===\nTransportation in the Canon-McMillan School District is provided mainly by [[school bus]]. The district also operates a small number of school vans and short buses (mostly for students that are physically [[handicapped]] and/or suffer from severe [[mental disabilities]], as well as students with behavioral or emotional issues that may cause disruption on a typical school bus.) Most van and short bus services are provided by third-party transit contractors. The school district is also legally bound by the state to provide transportation to [[private academies]] and [[parochial schools]] lying within its service zone. The Canon-Mac full size bus fleet is composed almost entirely of [[Blue Bird Vision]] school buses; second and third generations; built from 2008\u2013present. The district also has about ten-first generation Visions; built from 2003 to 2007; most of which remain in route service currently, but are soon to be retired. Among other buses retained by the district, two Thomas bodied [[Freightliner FS-65]]s (buses 10 and 31) remain in route service, alongside at least five of their newer counterparts, the [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2]] buses, ordered by the district during the 2012 and 2015\u20132017 model years. Two to four more full size FS-65s no longer in route service are kept at the Support Facility as backup buses for situations when route buses may not be operable for some reason. The district also began to add [[IC Bus|IC CE]] school buses to its fleet in 2019. Other student transport vehicles of the district include [[Ford E-Series]] passenger vans, [[Ford Transit]] passenger vans, [[Thomas Minotour]] short buses based upon Ford E-Series chassis, and short Thomas Conventional buses on either Freightliner FS-65 or [[International 3800]] chassis. The district fleet once included [[Blue Bird TC/2000]] type D buses, however these have all been retired and sold off. Several Blue Bird bodied full size International 3800s have been sold by the district as well, and only one of these buses remains today, repainted and with stop sign, warning lights, passenger windows, and most passenger seats removed. This bus serves primarily as an equipment transporter for the high school band and rarely travels with passengers aboard.\n\n==School buildings and other facilities==\nThe Canon-McMillan School District contains nine academic school buildings and three athletic complexes that are separate from the schools, as well as a school bus garage and a central administration building.\n\n===High school===\n'''Canon-McMillan High School''' is the largest school building in the district, both geographically and by student population. Currently, about 2,000 students in grades 9\u201312 attend CMHS. The school was originally built and opened as Canon-McMillan Senior High School in 1958 with grades 10\u201312, and has been expanded and renovated in 1966, 1983, 1988, 1994, 2001\u20132003, and 2017\u20132019. CMHS has two gymnasiums (Main and Auxiliary), a [[natatorium]], a weight room, and a mat room for wrestling practice as its athletic facilities. The school also has four outdoor tennis courts and formerly had an open playing field and outdoor exercise yard on its premises. An auditorium is also featured.\n\n The 1966 and 1983 extensions to CMHS both added additional classrooms, and the school's name was changed from Canon-McMillan Senior High to just Canon-McMillan High School in 1983. This was due to the district's reorganization plan which called for the 9th grade to be moved to the high school and for the junior high schools (which became middle schools at that point in time) to take on the 6th graders. The 1983 project also renovated the interior of the entire existing building, added seats to the auditorium, and reconfigured the athletic wing by replacing the original gym with a larger one that contained pull-out bleachers and an elevated walking track. The auxiliary gym, weight room, and mat room were added in 1988, and some other minor floor plan modifications were also made to other parts of the school at that time. The restrooms and locker rooms in that part of the building were remodeled and slightly modified in 1994. \n\nThe 2001\u20132003 project was the longest and most major renovation in the school's history. This project completely demolished and rebuilt the school's academic wings, added more parking, and moved the library, cafeteria, kitchen, and teacher's lounge closer to the school's entrances. A centrally located commons area with high vaulted ceilings; known as the Atrium; was also created during this time. Some minor repainting took place in both gyms, and the wood flooring of both was replaced. A press box and more pull-out collapsible bleachers were added to the main gym above the elevated track, and the exercise yard was eliminated as it was in the way of the new set of loading docks and part of the new classroom portion of the school. The natatorium was also built in this area, and has two entrances off of the hallway in the athletic wing. The performing arts and technology wing was also expanded, and the original loading docks, which were located at the end of that wing, became secondary loading docks. The main entrance to the school was modernized and the doors pushed about 8 feet forward, and most of the building's front fascia was re-bricked to give a more clean and updated appearance. A large digital sign was also added to the front of the school as part of the project. In total, about 90 percent of the original building was either renovated or replaced, and the entire student and staff populations benefited from the project. It would effectively relieve severe overcrowding at CMHS for the next 8 years, and increase student capacity from barely 1,200 students to around 1,500 students. The student body would continue to grow, however, and by 2011, the enrollment at the school had exceeded the 1,500 student maximum. \n\nThe school would remain overcrowded until 2017, when a new classroom extension was begun. Both academic wings were extended back, and the parking lot that used to be behind them was removed. The open playing field off of the athletic wing was paved over and made into a new lot to make up for lost parking area. Brand new Jumbotron-style scoreboards were installed in the main gym, along with revamped signage on the press box and outside of the doors. The auditorium was also remodeled with fresh paint, new ceilings, all new seats, and the expansion of the stage and backstage areas. New, better lighting systems and brand new acoustic wall panels were also installed, and the total seating capacity was significantly increased. The band room was nearly doubled in size and also received acoustic panels and other sound mitigation improvements. The teacher's lounge was again relocated, due to the cafeteria being expanded into its former location, and a [[security vestibule]] was added to the main office entrance. The reception portion of the office was remodeled and reconfigured to accommodate the new feature. Most building work and all major parts of the project concluded in February 2019. Some minor cosmetic landscaping work continued into the summer of 2019.\n\n===Intermediate/middle schools===\n'''Canonsburg Middle School''' is currently the only middle school in the Canon-McMillan School District and educates students in 7th and 8th grades. Present enrollment numbers around 1,100 students. It also houses the district-wide Special Education department offices, and is one of few Pittsburgh area middle schools that has never previously served as a high school to feature a natatorium.\n\nIt opened in 1967 as Canon-McMillan Junior High School, and was built on the former site of the original Canonsburg High School, demolished a few years earlier. The original school's historic auditorium still remains as a freestanding building however, initially dating back to the 1920s, and still in use for school and community functions to this day. In 1967, Canon-McMillan Junior High held students in grades 7\u20139. It was the second junior high school in the district, after Cecil Junior High (now Cecil Intermediate) opened four years earlier in 1963.\n\nCanon-McMillan Junior High became the grades 6\u20138 Canonsburg Middle School in 1983, and would see its first and only complete renovation the next year, in 1984. This project remodeled the structure's entire interior (with the exception of the auditorium, which is historically preserved), and updated electrical and plumbing work to meet the safety codes of the time. Computer labs and a large group instruction room were added in the 90s, however the latter has since been removed and permanently divided into three classrooms. 6th grade was removed from CMS in 2002. The school saw minor security upgrades near the main entrance in 2014, however, CMS is now slated to close in the coming years as the building's structural and physical condition is deteriorating, and having not seen a full renovation since the 80s, the school is extremely dated inside. Cracks and chips have formed in staircases and floor tiles over the years, mostly due to old age and prolonged wear and tear.\n\nCMS has also been severely overcrowded for several years. At most times, students cannot walk through its halls without encountering very heavy foot traffic. They will, however, be transferred to an all new school building that, as of 2018, has not yet been constructed, but is expected to be built and opened by 2021 at a new location and will have a larger student capacity than the current school. The name of the new building is currently to be determined, and the facility may or may not be called Canonsburg Middle School. The present-day building cannot be effectively expanded due to property space constraints and an overall original design and layout that did not take future wings and additions into consideration. The aforementioned auditorium will likely remain as-is, despite the school building's currently unknown fate after closure. Unconfirmed local rumors indicate that the building, if not demolished, may be either acquired by a church and converted into a religious school, or remodeled into apartment homes for senior citizens.\n\n'''Cecil Intermediate School''' is one of two intermediate schools in the Canon-McMillan School District and currently holds around 500 students in grades 5 and 6. The school opened in 1963 as Cecil Junior High School and as mentioned in the previous paragraph, originally taught students in the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. Beginning in 1983, the school held grades 6\u20138 and had its name changed to Cecil Middle School and finally, in 2002, 5th grade was added and grades 7 and 8 were dropped, and the school became the Cecil Intermediate School of today.\n\n'''North Strabane Intermediate School''' is the second intermediate school in the district and has a student body of around 550. It accommodates grades 5 and 6 and is the second newest school building in the district. The site next to Borland Manor Elementary was cleared in 2000 and the school opened in 2002, although it was not fully completed until 2003. There are also multiple baseball/softball fields with permanent dugouts, a small press building and digital scoreboards outside of the school, used for competition as well as softball practice.\n\n===Elementary schools===\n'''Borland Manor Elementary School''' is one of five current elementary schools in the Canon-McMillan School District. The school is home to around 320 students in grades K-4. It was built in 1968 as new housing was developed in the area and is adjacent to North Strabane Intermediate School (details above). The school was partially remodeled in the early 90s, but its condition has unfortunately once again declined since then.\n\n'''Hills-Hendersonville Elementary School''' teaches about 300 students in Kindergarten through 4th grade. The school opened in 1965 and an expansion is planned in the years ahead, as the school is currently operating at maximum capacity, however the exact dates of the project have not yet been determined. Minor renovations and visual updates took place in 2012.\n\n'''Muse Elementary School''' enrolls around 730 students in grades K-4. The current facility is the newest school building in the Canon-McMillan School District as of 2018. Muse is also the largest elementary school in the district by enrollment. The current building replaced the original Muse Elementary, which was built in 1936 and razed upon completion of the new school in 2017. The current school is a consolidation of the now closed Cecil and First Street Elementary Schools (which opened in 1936 and 1924 respectively) into the Muse facility. The new school is more than 4 times the size of its predecessor geographically.\n\n'''South Central Elementary School''' currently has a student body numbering about 470 pupils in grades K-4. The school opened in 1973 and was renovated and expanded in 1995. The project included interior repainting, minor floor plan alterations, remodeling of the library and main office, and the addition of windows to all classrooms with walls to the outside. A scientific plant growing lab/greenhouse, still one of only two in the district, was also added to the school at that time.\n\n'''Wylandville Elementary School''' is the oldest operational school building in the district as of 2018. The school opened to students in 1951 and is currently populated by about 220 students in grades K-4, making it the smallest school in the district by enrollment. Wylandville was last renovated in 1979 and is to be overhauled in the next few years, as age, decay, and outdatedness have taken their toll on the current building significantly. Project dates are undisclosed at this time. It is also home to the district's second greenhouse, known as the \"Living Classroom\".\n\n===Other facilities===\n'''Big Mac Stadium''' serves as the Canon-McMillan School District's main athletic facility. It was initially built up as a formal stadium in the 1970s, however, the grounds that it occupies have been used for athletic events since the 1930s. The stadium is sometimes also called Canon-McMillan Stadium or Canonsburg Stadium. It recently underwent renovations to expand seating areas and add new locker rooms and more parking. It had its running track resurfaced and artificial turf replaced in 2016. The stadium received artificial turf for the first time in 1998, which was when the last major renovation prior to the most recent one occurred. It is located just off Jefferson Avenue near the heart of Canonsburg, and is adjacent to the district's Central Administration building.\n\n'''McDowell Field''' is the district's primary baseball practice complex, named for the road on which it is located. Besides a baseball diamond, the site also contains multipurpose playing fields and service buildings which house locker rooms, restrooms, a concession stand, a press room, and the controls for the scoreboard.\n\n'''West McMurray Road Soccer Complex''', alternatively known as '''Van Eman Field''', is a triangular grass field divided into several small soccer pitches and serves as a practice field for the Canon-McMillan Youth Soccer Association, the district league for boys and girls soccer at the elementary school level. The de facto name Van Eman Field comes from Van Eman Creek, which runs near the site. The entire field is fenced in. There is a North Strabane Township municipal pump station on the premises, which is fenced off separately from the field itself to prevent unauthorized access. The site does not have any permanent buildings besides a basic wooden shelter that are accessible to its users, as portable toilets and a utility trailer are only used at the field seasonally.\n\n'''Canon-McMillan Support Facility''' serves as both the district's school bus/school van garage and the headquarters for the district-wide maintenance and custodial department. It is a large, aircraft hangar-like building providing indoor parking and maintenance space for most of the district's buses, vans, and maintenance vehicles, with an attached annex designated for offices and the service and repair shop. It was built in 1990 and is diagonally across the street from the high school.\n\n'''Canon-McMillan Central Administration Building''' holds the School Board offices, meeting room, Superintendent's office, Assistant Superintendent's office, and all district-wide department offices, with the exception of the Special Education and Maintenance/ Custodial departments. It was built in the 1970s and is in front of Big Mac Stadium on Jefferson Ave.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=May 2019}}\nThe Canon-McMillan School District was founded on September 15, 1954 in a merger between the Canonsburg, Cecil Township, and North Strabane Township schools. Canon-McMillan High School was formerly known as Canonsburg High school and Cecil High School when the name was changed. The high school moved to its current location in 1958. The district is named for Col. [[John Canon]] and the Rev. [[John McMillan (missionary)|John McMillan]]. [[John McMillan's Log School]]; which dates back to the 1780s, is located outside the present day Canonsburg Middle School.\n\n==Comprehensive list of schools==\nThe Canon-McMillan School District operates a total of nine schools:\n* Canon-McMillan High School\n* Canonsburg Middle School\n* North Strabane Intermediate School\n* Cecil Intermediate School\n* Borland Manor Elementary School\n* Hills-Hendersonville Elementary School\n* Muse Elementary School\n* South Central Elementary School\n* Wylandville Elementary School\nThere are also two former schools in the district that closed on June 1, 2017 after Muse Elementary was completely overhauled and expanded:\n*  First Street Elementary School \n*  Cecil Elementary School\nA third defunct school, [[Hawthorne School (Canonsburg, Pennsylvania)|Hawthorne Elementary School]], closed in 1982 due to declining district wide enrollment at the time. The school was demolished in 1986.\n\n==Governance==\nThe school district is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] and the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]].<ref>Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010</ref> The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills.\n\nThe Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration an \"F\" for transparency based on a review of \"What information can people find on their school district's website\". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Pennsylvania_school_districts |title=The Pennsylvania Project |author=The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131940/http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Pennsylvania_school_districts |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Academic achievement==\nIn 2011, the Canon-McMillan School District ranked 99th of 498 Pennsylvania school districts.

Both participation and cumulative quantity of credits that can be earned is limited due to budget constraints. The state dual enrollment program would permit high school students to take courses at local higher education institutions (including those other than CCAC) to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The credits count towards high school graduation requirements, and towards earning a college degree, in both this program and the school-funded program mentioned above. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school, including the graduation ceremony. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate.

Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate \u2013 land and buildings. The [[property tax]] is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75\u201385%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/summaries_of_annual_financial_report_data/7673/afr_excel_data_files/509047 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Act 511 Tax Report |year=2004}}</ref>\n\n* 2010\u201311 \u2013 105.4100 mills<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2010}}</ref>\n* 2009\u201310 \u2013 101.8500 mills<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Elements Reports |year=2010}}</ref>\n* 2008\u201309 \u2013 97.0000 mills<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Elements Reports 2008\u201309 Real Estate Mills |year=2009}}</ref>\n* 2007\u201308 \u2013 94.5000 mills<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===Act 1 adjusted index===\n\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Referendum Exceptions Taxpayer Relief Act |year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Canon-McMillan School District 2006\u20132007 through 2010\u20132011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/property_tax_reduction_allocations/510335 |title=Property Tax Reduction Allocations |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011}}</ref>\n\n* 2006\u201307 \u2013 4.7%, Base 3.9%\n* 2007\u201308 \u2013 4.1%, Base 3.4%\n* 2008\u201309 \u2013 5.3%, Base 4.4%\n* 2009\u201310 \u2013 5.0%, Base 4.1%\n* 2010\u201311 \u2013 3.5%, Base 2.9%\n* 2011\u201312 \u2013 1.7%, Base 1.4%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-38/1760.html |title=Index Calculation Required by the Taxpayer Relief Act Sept 18 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Data Elements}}</ref>\n* 2012\u201313 \u2013 2.1%, Base \u2013 1.7%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=The Index Special Session Act 1 of 2006 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2011\u201312 school year, the Canon-McMillan School Board sought 2 exceptions: special education costs and pension costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |title=Adjusted Index History |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2011}}</ref> For the district's 2010\u201311 budget year, the Canon-McMillan School Board did not seek exceptions to the Index limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Referendum Exceptions for 2010\u20132011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Referendum Exceptions for 2009\u20132010 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2009}}</ref>\n\nEach year, the school district has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February.

Fair]].<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|26}} While working in the mines of Virginia City, Daly met and befriended [[George Hearst]] and partners [[James Ben Ali Haggin]] and [[Lloyd Tevis]], co-owners of the Ophir Mining Company. (Hearst's son was [[William Randolph Hearst]]). In 1872, Daly would recommend purchase by the Hearst group the [[Ontario silver mine|Ontario mine]], near [[Park City, Utah]]. In ten years, the Ontario produced $17 million and paid [[United States dollar|$]]6,250,000 in dividends, and made many millions for Hearst, Tevis and Haggin.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nTheir business friendship was to extend for many years and help establish the [[Anaconda Copper Mine (Montana)|Anaconda Copper Mine]] in [[Butte, Montana]]. Daly originally came to Butte in August 1876 to look at a mine, the Alice, as an agent for the Walker Bros. of [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]].<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|46}} The Walkers purchased the mine, installed Daly as superintendent and awarded him a fractional share of the mine.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|50}}\n\nAlways an energetic engineer and geologist with a keen eye for paying ore, When working for a rubber ducky company he noticed while working underground in the Alice, that there were significant deposits of [[copper ore]]. He gained access into several other mines in the area and concluded that the hill was full of copper ore. He envisioned an ore body several thousand feet deep, some veins of almost pure copper and hundreds of millions of dollars. He urged his employers, the Walker Bros. to purchase the Anaconda and when they refrained, Daly bought it. Daly founded his fortune on the Anaconda Copper Mine in Butte, after selling his small share of the Alice Mine, for $30,000.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|50\u201352}}\n\n==The Anaconda==\nThe Anaconda began as a silver mine, but Daly's purchase was for the copper, found to be one of the largest deposits known at the time. However, he lacked the money to develop it, so he turned to Hearst, Haggin and Tevis.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|48\u201349,52\u201353}} Backed with many millions of dollars, he set out upon developing ''The Richest Hill on Earth''. The first couple hundred feet within the mine were rich in silver, and took a few years to exhaust. By that time, Butte's other silver mines were also playing out, so Daly closed the Anaconda, St Lawrence and Neversweat mines. He reported to his associates what he had in mind and they approved. Prices on surrounding properties dropped and Daly quietly purchased them. Then he re-opened the Anaconda as a copper mine and announced to the world that Butte was \"The Richest Hill on Earth\".<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|64,67}} Because [[Thomas Edison]] had developed the light bulb and built a city block in New York to show off what electricity could do, the world would need copper, a very excellent conductor of electricity. Butte had copper. Hundreds of thousands of tons of it, waiting to be taken from the ground.\n\nHe built a smelter to handle the ore, and by the late 1880s, had become a millionaire several times over, and owner of the Anaconda Mining and Reduction Company. Daly owned a railroad, the [[Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railroad]] to haul ore from his mines to his smelter in [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]], a city he founded for his employees to work the smelters. He owned lumber interests in the [[Bitterroot Valley]], a mansion and prized stables in the same valley, south of [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]].\n\nIn 1894, Daly spearheaded an energetic but unsuccessful campaign to have Anaconda designated as Montana's state capital, but lost out to [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], which was supported by [[William A. Clark|William Andrews Clark]].<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|111\u2013113}} Daly was active in Montana politics throughout the 1890s, because of his opposition and intense rivalry with fellow copper king, and future [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], William Clark.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|46\u201347}} Daly tried to keep Clark out of office by lavishly supporting Clark's opponents.<ref name=copper3>{{cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: The Copper Kings|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers6/copperkings.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune Staff|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, Daly went looking for a buyer of his company. He entered into negotiations with [[William Rockefeller]] and [[Henry H. Rogers]] of [[John D Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil of Ohio]]. The [[Anaconda Mining Company]] (and associated interests) were purchased in 1899 for $39 million and became [[Amalgamated Copper Mining Company]]. Daly was made president of the company in 1899 and died the following year in 1900.\n\n==Thoroughbred horse racing==\nDaly invested some of his money in [[horse breeding]] at his Bitterroot Stock Farm located near [[Hamilton, Montana|Hamilton]], and was the owner/breeder of [[Scottish Chieftain (horse)|Scottish Chieftain]], the only horse bred in Montana to ever win the [[Belmont Stakes]] (1897).\n\nIn 1891, Daly became the owner of [[Tammany (horse)|Tammany]], said to be one of the world's fastest racehorses in 1893. He owned and stood [[Inverness (horse)|Inverness]], [[sire]] of Scottish Chieftain, as well as [[Hamburg (horse)|Hamburg]], [[Ogden (horse)|Ogden]], and [[The Pepper]]. He also arranged the breeding of the great [[Sysonby]], ranked number 30 in the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]] by [[Blood-Horse magazine]]. Daly died before the horse was born.\n\nFollowing his death, New York's [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] hosted a dispersal sale for the Bitterroot thoroughbred studs on January 31, 1901; 185 horses were sold for $405,525.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07EEDC143FE433A25752C0A9649C946097D6CF January 31, 1901 ''New York Times'' article on the Bitter Root dispersal sale]</ref>\n\n== Legacy==\n[[File:Hamilton MT Daly Mansion 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Margaret Daly's house, Riverside, near Hamilton]]\nDaly's legacy was a mixed one for Anaconda. From 1885 to 1980, the smelter was one of the town's largest employers and provided well-paid jobs for generations. When the smelter closed in 1980, during a labor strike, 25% of the town's workforce was put out of work and the town has not recovered. The smelter itself was torn down as part of environmental cleanup efforts in the 1990s, although the smokestack is still in place, visible for many miles across the valley, above the town.\n\nDaly's legacy was equally mixed for [[Butte, Montana|Butte]]. The Anaconda Company was bought out by the [[Anaconda Copper|Amalgamated Copper Mining Company]] in 1899, and by the 1920s it controlled mining in the city. It continued to be one of the state's largest employers and a mainstay of the state and local economies until the 1970s. In the 1950s, the ACM began open-pit mining in Butte, creating a steadily growing pit, known as the [[Berkeley Pit]], east of the main business district. In the mid-1970s, copper prices collapsed and the ACM was bought out by the Atlantic Richfield Company, ([[ARCO]]). ARCO ceased mining in Butte in 1980 and shut off the deep pumps in 1982, ending what Daly had begun almost exactly 100 years before. Montana Resources, owned by the Washington Group, as of 2007, operates an open pit copper and molybdenum mine in Butte, and also recovers copper from the water in the Berkeley Pit. In 1980 the [[Berkeley Pit]], the [[Clark Fork River]] and the smelter outside the town of [[Anaconda, MT]] were declared federal [[Superfund]] sites by the US EPA.\n\nA statue of Daly by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] stands at the main entrance to Montana Tech of the University of Montana (formerly the Montana School of Mines), at the west end of Park Street in Butte.\n\nA drawing of Daly by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury]] (1862\u20131947) was acquired in 2009 by the American National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C.\n\nRiverside, the summer home of the Daly Family, is located in Hamilton, Montana and open to visitors.

He sold newspapers and worked his way to [[California]] in time to join the gold rush on what was to become [[Virginia City]], [[Nevada]], and the fabulously rich silver diggings now known as the [[Comstock Lode]], in 1860.<ref name=\"Glasscock\">{{cite book|author=Glasscock, C.B.|title=The War of the Copper Kings|publisher=Riverbend Publishing|year=2002|isbn=1-931832-21-8}}</ref>{{rp|27}}\n\n== Career==\nDaly gained experience in the mines of the Comstock under the direction of [[John William Mackay]] and [[James G. Fair]].<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|26}} While working in the mines of Virginia City, Daly met and befriended [[George Hearst]] and partners [[James Ben Ali Haggin]] and [[Lloyd Tevis]], co-owners of the Ophir Mining Company. (Hearst's son was [[William Randolph Hearst]]). In 1872, Daly would recommend purchase by the Hearst group the [[Ontario silver mine|Ontario mine]], near [[Park City, Utah]]. In ten years, the Ontario produced $17 million and paid [[United States dollar|$]]6,250,000 in dividends, and made many millions for Hearst, Tevis and Haggin.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nTheir business friendship was to extend for many years and help establish the [[Anaconda Copper Mine (Montana)|Anaconda Copper Mine]] in [[Butte, Montana]]. Daly originally came to Butte in August 1876 to look at a mine, the Alice, as an agent for the Walker Bros. of [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]].<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|46}} The Walkers purchased the mine, installed Daly as superintendent and awarded him a fractional share of the mine.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|50}}\n\nAlways an energetic engineer and geologist with a keen eye for paying ore, Daly noticed while working underground in the Alice, that there were significant deposits of [[copper ore]]. He gained access into several other mines in the area and concluded that the hill was full of copper ore. He envisioned an ore body several thousand feet deep, some veins of almost pure copper and hundreds of millions of dollars. He urged his employers, the Walker Bros. to purchase the Anaconda and when they refrained, Daly bought it. Daly founded his fortune on the Anaconda Copper Mine in Butte, after selling his small share of the Alice Mine, for $30,000.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|50\u201352}}\n\n==The Anaconda==\nThe Anaconda began as a silver mine, but Daly's purchase was for the copper, found to be one of the largest deposits known at the time. However, he lacked the money to develop it, so he turned to Hearst, Haggin and Tevis.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|48\u201349,52\u201353}} Backed with many millions of dollars, he set out upon developing ''The Richest Hill on Earth''. The first couple hundred feet within the mine were rich in silver, and took a few years to exhaust. By that time, Butte's other silver mines were also playing out, so Daly closed the Anaconda, St Lawrence and Neversweat mines. He reported to his associates what he had in mind and they approved. Prices on surrounding properties dropped and Daly quietly purchased them. Then he re-opened the Anaconda as a copper mine and announced to the world that Butte was \"The Richest Hill on Earth\".<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|64,67}} Because [[Thomas Edison]] had developed the light bulb and built a city block in New York to show off what electricity could do, the world would need copper, a very excellent conductor of electricity. Butte had copper. Hundreds of thousands of tons of it, waiting to be taken from the ground.\n\nHe built a smelter to handle the ore, and by the late 1880s, had become a millionaire several times over, and owner of the Anaconda Mining and Reduction Company. Daly owned a railroad, the [[Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railroad]] to haul ore from his mines to his smelter in [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]], a city he founded for his employees to work the smelters. He owned lumber interests in the [[Bitterroot Valley]], a mansion and prized stables in the same valley, south of [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]].\n\nIn 1894, Daly spearheaded an energetic but unsuccessful campaign to have Anaconda designated as Montana's state capital, but lost out to [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], which was supported by [[William A. Clark|William Andrews Clark]].<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|111\u2013113}} Daly was active in Montana politics throughout the 1890s, because of his opposition and intense rivalry with fellow copper king, and future [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], William Clark.<ref name=\"Glasscock\"/>{{rp|46\u201347}} Daly tried to keep Clark out of office by lavishly supporting Clark's opponents.<ref name=copper3>{{cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: The Copper Kings|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers6/copperkings.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune Staff|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, Daly went looking for a buyer of his company. He entered into negotiations with [[William Rockefeller]] and [[Henry H. Rogers]] of [[John D Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil of Ohio]]. The [[Anaconda Mining Company]] (and associated interests) were purchased in 1899 for $39 million and became [[Amalgamated Copper Mining Company]]. Daly was made president of the company in 1899 and died the following year in 1900.\n\n==Thoroughbred horse racing==\nDaly invested some of his money in [[horse breeding]] at his Bitterroot Stock Farm located near [[Hamilton, Montana|Hamilton]], and was the owner/breeder of [[Scottish Chieftain (horse)|Scottish Chieftain]], the only horse bred in Montana to ever win the [[Belmont Stakes]] (1897).\n\nIn 1891, Daly became the owner of [[Tammany (horse)|Tammany]], said to be one of the world's fastest racehorses in 1893. He owned and stood [[Inverness (horse)|Inverness]], [[sire]] of Scottish Chieftain, as well as [[Hamburg (horse)|Hamburg]], [[Ogden (horse)|Ogden]], and [[The Pepper]]. He also arranged the breeding of the great [[Sysonby]], ranked number 30 in the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]] by [[Blood-Horse magazine]]. Daly died before the horse was born.\n\nFollowing his death, New York's [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] hosted a dispersal sale for the Bitterroot thoroughbred studs on January 31, 1901; 185 horses were sold for $405,525.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07EEDC143FE433A25752C0A9649C946097D6CF January 31, 1901 ''New York Times'' article on the Bitter Root dispersal sale]</ref>\n\n== Legacy==\n[[File:Hamilton MT Daly Mansion 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Margaret Daly's house, Riverside, near Hamilton]]\nDaly's legacy was a mixed one for Anaconda. From 1885 to 1980, the smelter was one of the town's largest employers and provided well-paid jobs for generations. When the smelter closed in 1980, during a labor strike, 25% of the town's workforce was put out of work and the town has not recovered. The smelter itself was torn down as part of environmental cleanup efforts in the 1990s, although the smokestack is still in place, visible for many miles across the valley, above the town.\n\nDaly's legacy was equally mixed for [[Butte, Montana|Butte]]. The Anaconda Company was bought out by the [[Anaconda Copper|Amalgamated Copper Mining Company]] in 1899, and by the 1920s it controlled mining in the city. It continued to be one of the state's largest employers and a mainstay of the state and local economies until the 1970s. In the 1950s, the ACM began open-pit mining in Butte, creating a steadily growing pit, known as the [[Berkeley Pit]], east of the main business district. In the mid-1970s, copper prices collapsed and the ACM was bought out by the Atlantic Richfield Company, ([[ARCO]]). ARCO ceased mining in Butte in 1980 and shut off the deep pumps in 1982, ending what Daly had begun almost exactly 100 years before. Montana Resources, owned by the Washington Group, as of 2007, operates an open pit copper and molybdenum mine in Butte, and also recovers copper from the water in the Berkeley Pit. In 1980 the [[Berkeley Pit]], the [[Clark Fork River]] and the smelter outside the town of [[Anaconda, MT]] were declared federal [[Superfund]] sites by the US EPA.\n\nA statue of Daly by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] stands at the main entrance to Montana Tech of the University of Montana (formerly the Montana School of Mines), at the west end of Park Street in Butte.\n\nA drawing of Daly by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury]] (1862\u20131947) was acquired in 2009 by the American National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C.\n\nRiverside, the summer home of the Daly Family, is located in Hamilton, Montana and open to visitors. Margaret Daly, Marcus' wife, had the home remodeled after his death into a Georgian-Revival Style Colonial.<ref>[http://www.dalymansion.org/history/househistory.php Marcus Daly Mansion History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129021016/http://www.dalymansion.org/history/househistory.php |date=2017-11-29 }} Retrieved February 9, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.mdmh.org Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital], located in Hamilton, Montana, was incorporated on December 18, 1929.\n\nDuring WWII, the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] honored Marcus Daly with a liberty ship in honor of his accomplishments, the [[SS Marcus Daly]].
