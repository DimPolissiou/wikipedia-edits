It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within. However both sides held their fire and began negotiations. The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers.

in the third week of April 2001 between troops of the [[Bangladesh Rifles]] (BDR) and the Indian [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) on the <nowiki/>poorly marked [[international border]] between the two countries.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal in 1947]] left a poorly demarcated international border between India and Bangladesh (then-[[East Pakistan]]). Ownership of several villages on both sides of the [[de facto]] border were disputed and claimed by both countries. The dispute over the demarcation of the Indo-Bangladeshi border worsened due to the existence of over [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|190 enclaves]].\n\nOne of the disputed areas was a small sliver of land near the village of Padua/Pyrdiwah, on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]],<ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] was used by Indian security forces to train the Bangladeshi [[Mukti Bahini]], who were fighting the [[Pakistani Army]].

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within. However both sides held their fire and began negotiations. The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers.

Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]].

There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|MONA ROMA ferry in the Port of Hobart]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed.

Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of

Infrastructure is provided by the port of Hobart for scientific research and cruise ships, and [[Hobart International Airport]] supports an Antarctic Airlink to Wilkins Runway at [[Casey Station]]. Hobart is a logistics point for the French icebreaker [[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|''L'Astrolabe'']].\n\nHobart is the home port for the Australian and French Antarctic programs, and provides port services for other visiting Antarctic nations and Antarctic cruise ships. Antarctic and Southern Ocean expeditions are supported by a specialist cluster offering cold climate products, services and scientific expertise. The majority of these businesses and organisations are members of the [[Tasmanian polar network]], supported in part by the Tasmanian State Government.\n\nTasmania has a high concentration of Antarctic and Southern Ocean scientists.

The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834 to 1836, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847.

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.\n\n[[File:HobartAirportTerminal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hobart International Airport]]]]\n\nFerry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service \u2013 leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|MONA ROMA ferry in the Port of Hobart]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100&nbsp;million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]].

{"title_page": "Subdivisions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", "text_new": "[[Image:Provinces_et_Territoires_du_Republique_Democratique_du_Congo.png|thumb|DR Congo provinces, territories, and a few cities.|upright=1.18]]\n{{Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\nThe Third Republic of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is a [[unitary state]] with a five-level heirarchy of types of [[administrative division]].  There are nine different types of subdivision in a new hierarchy with no new types but with two from the previous one abolished.\n\nUnder the Third Republic, established in 2006, the number of provinces has gone from ten to twenty-five.  By fits and starts the number of towns that have been, or are in the process of being, upgraded to cities has also increased greatly.\n\n==Territorial organization==\nThe hierarchy of types of administrative division in the Congo is as follows:{{Sfn|Organic Law No. 08/016|loc=article 4}}\n<br/>\n<small>''(French names in italics.)''</small>\n\n* [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Province]]\n** [[List of territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Territory]] (''territoire'')\n***Sector or Chiefdom (''secteur'' or ''chefferie'')\n**** Grouping (''groupement'')\n***** Village\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\n** City (''ville'')\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\nSo a Province is divided into territories and cities; a territory into sectors, chiefdoms, and communes; a sector or chiefdom into groupings; and so on.\n\n===Remarks===\n* [[Kinshasa]], as the capital city, has the status of a province with the subdivisions of a city.  It is often referred to as a city-province.\n* The district and the ''cit\u00e9'', previously a division of a province and territory respectively, have been abolished.  The ''cit\u00e9'' has been replaced by the commune.\n* In the Congo a commune can now be an urban subdivision of a city, a country town, or in some cases a mostly rural area attached to a city.\n* An older term, collectivity (fr. ''collectivit\u00e9''), is sometimes used for convenience to refer to both a sector and a chiefdom.\n* Some collectivities are not a contiguous area of land but are made up of more than one unconnected area.\n* The grouping (of villages) and, at a higher level, the chiefdom are subdivisions led by customary leaders of traditional [[polity|polities]].\n* An embedded grouping is a grouping that has been absorbed into a commune.\n* There are uninhabited areas that are not part of any subdivision below a territory.\n\n==New subdivisions==\n\n===Provinces===\nThe constitution increased the number of provinces from ten to twenty-five.  In the summer of 2015 the six largest provinces\u2014[[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], [[\u00c9quateur (former province)|\u00c9quateur]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Occidental]], [[Kasai-Oriental (former province)|Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], and [[Orientale Province|Orientale]]\u2014were split up into twenty-one new provinces: [[Bas-Uele]], a new [[Province of \u00c9quateur|\u00c9quateur]], [[Haut-Lomami]], [[Haut-Katanga]], [[Haut-Uele]], [[Ituri Province|Ituri]], [[Kasa\u00ef Province|Kasa\u00ef]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Central]], a new [[Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Kwango]], [[Kwilu Province|Kwilu]], [[Lomami Province|Lomami]], [[Lualaba Province|Lualaba]], [[Mai-Ndombe Province|Mai-Ndombe]], [[Mongala]], [[Nord-Ubangi]], [[Sankuru]], [[Sud-Ubangi]], [[Tanganyika Province|Tanganyika]], [[Tshopo]], and [[Tshuapa]].  Each new province corresponded to a former district except for Lualaba and Mai-Ndombe which were each formed from two districts.  Together with the four unsplit provinces\u2014[[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo]] (renamed Kongo Central), [[Maniema]], [[Nord-Kivu]], and [[Sud-Kivu]]\u2014they make up the twenty-five provinces listed in article two of the constitution.{{Sfn|Radio Okapi 4 Mar 2015}}{{Sfn|Bouvier|Omasombo Tshonda|2016|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n=== Cities and communes ===\nIn June 2013 a batch of prime ministerial decrees was issued giving city and commune status to, and setting the boundaries for, a large number of former ''cit\u00e9s'' and other populated places.{{Sfn|Journal Officiel|2013|loc=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 13/020\u201313/030 du 13 juin 2013}}  According to the government's 2014 statistical yearbook the Congo would go from 21 cities and 227 ''cit\u00e9s'' in 2008 to 99 cities and 289 territorial communes in the reorganization.{{Sfn|2014 Statistical Yearbook|loc=Tableau 1.2 and 1.3|pp=28\u201329}}  However, in July 2015 the implementation of many of the decrees' articles were suspended following the failure in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]] of an electoral bill based on the boundaries in the decrees.{{Sfn|le Phare 23 Jul 2015}}\n\nIn order to pass a modified bill allocating seats for upcoming local elections, it was decided to suspend those articles that were contentious and to revert the affected communities to their 2006 administrative configurations.  The articles granting city status to new provincial capitals\u2014[[Boende]], [[Bunia]], [[Buta, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Buta]], [[Gemena]], [[Inongo]], [[Isiro]], [[Kabinda]], [[Kalemie]], [[Kamina]], [[Kenge, Kwango|Kenge]], [[Lisala]], and [[Lusambo]]\u2014were not suspended and neither were those granting commune status to the administrative centers of the territories.{{Sfn|Matotu|2015}}\n\nUltimately the planned for local elections never occurred, but the suspensions were not lifted until mid-2018 just months before the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|general election]].  The National Alliance of Traditional Authorities of the Congo protested this reinstatement as diminishing traditional authority and as a threat to national security.{{Sfn|Le Potentiel|2018}}  In addition to reinstating the articles the government decided that disputes over boundaries would be resolved by an ad-hoc committee and that the setting up of cities and communes would be prioritized with 18 cities in the initial phase.{{Sfnm|1a1= D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 18/020 |2a1=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Interministeriel n\u00b0 25/\u2026/2018}}  \n\nIn 2019 mayors for the new cities of [[Uvira]], [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]], [[Kamituga]], and [[Kasumbalesa, Democratic Republic of the Congo| Kasumbalesa]] were appointed.{{Sfn|Balongelwa|2019 }}{{Sfn|Nzadi News|2019}}  The setting up of a city administration and those of its subdivisions can take years given the lack of local resources.  For instance the town of Buta gained city status when it became a provincial capital in 2015, had its first mayor appointed in 2018, and by June 2019 its four communes where still not operational.{{Sfn|Okonda|2019}}\n\n== Subdivision count ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2018 Subdivision count by administrative level<ref>Level 1\u20134 tabulated from data found at [[#{{SfnRef|CENI maps}}|CENI maps]]; level 5 from [[#{{SfnRef|CENI 2017}}|CENI 2017]], p. 55, Tableau 10</ref>\n|-\n!

The count of cities only includes those currently represented in the national and provincial assemblies and not those that became cities after the organization of the elections.  Thus, for example, the new city of Uvira is not counted as a city but as a commune in the table.  This of course also effects the counts of city subdivisions such as communes and quarters.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n*[[List of provinces of the

Congo}}\nThe Third Republic of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is a [[unitary state]] with a five-level heirarchy of types of [[Administrative division]].  There are nine different types of subdivision in a new hierarchy with no new types but with two from the previous one abolished.\n\nUnder the Third Republic, established in 2006, the number of provinces has gone from ten to twenty-five.  By fits and starts the number of towns that have been, or are in the process of being, upgraded to cities has also increased greatly.\n\n==Territorial organization==\nThe hierarchy of types of administrative division in the Congo is as follows:{{Sfn|Organic Law No. 08/016|loc=article 4}}\n<br/>\n<small>''(French names in italics.)''</small>\n\n* [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Province]]\n** [[List of territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Territory]] (''territoire'')\n***Sector or Chiefdom (''secteur'' or ''chefferie'')\n**** Grouping (''groupement'')\n***** Village\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\n** City (''ville'')\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\nSo a Province is divided into territories and cities; a territory into sectors, chiefdoms, and communes; a sector or chiefdom into groupings; and so on.\n\n===Remarks===\n* [[Kinshasa]], as the capital city, has the status of a province with the subdivisions of a city.  It is often referred to as a city-province.\n* The district and the ''cit\u00e9'', previously a division of a province and territory respectively, have been abolished.  The ''cit\u00e9'' has been replaced by the commune.\n* In the Congo a commune can now be an urban subdivision of a city, a country town, or in some cases a mostly rural area attached to a city.\n* An older term, collectivity (fr. ''collectivit\u00e9''), is sometimes used for convenience to refer to both a sector and a chiefdom.\n* Some collectivities are not a contiguous area of land but are made up of more than one unconnected area.\n* The grouping (of villages) and, at a higher level, the chiefdom are subdivisions led by customary leaders of traditional [[polity|polities]].\n* An embedded grouping is a grouping that has been absorbed into a commune.\n* There are uninhabited areas that are not part of any subdivision below a territory.\n\n==New subdivisions==\n\n===Provinces===\nThe constitution increased the number of provinces from ten to twenty-five.  In the summer of 2015 the six largest provinces\u2014[[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], [[\u00c9quateur (former province)|\u00c9quateur]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Occidental]], [[Kasai-Oriental (former province)|Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], and [[Orientale Province|Orientale]]\u2014were split up into twenty-one new provinces: [[Bas-Uele]], a new [[Province of \u00c9quateur|\u00c9quateur]], [[Haut-Lomami]], [[Haut-Katanga]], [[Haut-Uele]], [[Ituri Province|Ituri]], [[Kasa\u00ef Province|Kasa\u00ef]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Central]], a new [[Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Kwango]], [[Kwilu Province|Kwilu]], [[Lomami Province|Lomami]], [[Lualaba Province|Lualaba]], [[Mai-Ndombe Province|Mai-Ndombe]], [[Mongala]], [[Nord-Ubangi]], [[Sankuru]], [[Sud-Ubangi]], [[Tanganyika Province|Tanganyika]], [[Tshopo]], and [[Tshuapa]].  Each new province corresponded to a former district except for Lualaba and Mai-Ndombe which were each formed from two districts.  Together with the four unsplit provinces\u2014[[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo]] (renamed Kongo Central), [[Maniema]], [[Nord-Kivu]], and [[Sud-Kivu]]\u2014they make up the twenty-five provinces listed in article two of the constitution.{{Sfn|Radio Okapi 4 Mar 2015}}{{Sfn|Bouvier|Omasombo Tshonda|2016|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n=== Cities and communes ===\nIn June 2013 a batch of prime ministerial decrees was issued giving city and commune status to, and setting the boundaries for, a large number of former ''cit\u00e9s'' and other populated places.{{Sfn|Journal Officiel|2013|loc=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 13/020\u201313/030 du 13 juin 2013}}  According to the government's 2014 statistical yearbook the Congo would go from 21 cities and 227 ''cit\u00e9s'' in 2008 to 99 cities and 289 territorial communes in the reorganization.{{Sfn|2014 Statistical Yearbook|loc=Tableau 1.2 and 1.3|pp=28\u201329}}  However, in July 2015 the implementation of many of the decrees' articles were suspended following the failure in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]] of an electoral bill based on the boundaries in the decrees.{{Sfn|le Phare 23 Jul 2015}}\n\nIn order to pass a modified bill allocating seats for upcoming local elections, it was decided to suspend those articles that were contentious and to revert the affected communities to their 2006 administrative configurations.  The articles granting city status to new provincial capitals\u2014[[Boende]], [[Bunia]], [[Buta, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Buta]], [[Gemena]], [[Inongo]], [[Isiro]], [[Kabinda]], [[Kalemie]], [[Kamina]], [[Kenge, Kwango|Kenge]], [[Lisala]], and [[Lusambo]]\u2014were not suspended and neither were those granting commune status to the administrative centers of the territories.{{Sfn|Matotu|2015}}\n\nUltimately the planned for local elections never occurred, but the suspensions were not lifted until mid-2018 just months before the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|general election]].  The National Alliance of Traditional Authorities of the Congo protested this reinstatement as diminishing traditional authority and as a threat to national security.{{Sfn|Le Potentiel|2018}}  In addition to reinstating the articles the government decided that disputes over boundaries would be resolved by an ad-hoc committee and that the setting up of cities and communes would be prioritized with 18 cities in the initial phase.{{Sfnm|1a1= D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 18/020 |2a1=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Interministeriel n\u00b0 25/\u2026/2018}}  \n\nIn 2019 mayors for the new cities of [[Uvira]], [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]], [[Kamituga]], and [[Kasumbalesa, Democratic Republic of the Congo| Kasumbalesa]] were appointed.{{Sfn|Balongelwa|2019 }}{{Sfn|Nzadi News|2019}}  The setting up of a city administration and those of its subdivisions can take years given the lack of local resources.  For instance the town of Buta gained city status when it became a provincial capital in 2015, had its first mayor appointed in 2018, and by June 2019 its four communes where still not operational.{{Sfn|Okonda|2019}}\n\n== Subdivision count ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2018 Subdivision count by administrative level<ref>Level 1\u20134 tabulated from data found at [[#{{SfnRef|CENI maps}}|CENI maps]]; level 5 from [[#{{SfnRef|CENI 2017}}|CENI 2017]], p. 55, Tableau 10</ref>\n|-\n!

The count of cities only includes those currently represented in the national and provincial assemblies and not those that became cities after the organization of the elections.  Thus, for example, the new city of Uvira is not counted as a city but as a commune in the table.  This of course also effects the counts of city subdivisions such as communes and quarters.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n*[[List of provinces of the

By 1975, Air Viet Nam started using [[Douglas DC-3]]s and [[Boeing 727]]s on both regional and international routes.\n\nAs passenger traffic increased with the start of the [[Vietnam War]], Air Viet Nam added aircraft, initially [[Vickers Viscount|Viscounts]], DC-3s, and [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4s]]. It eventually obtained more modern aircraft, including Boeing 727s, some of which were obtained from [[Air France]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]. At least one [[C-46 Commando|C-46]] was leased from [[China Airlines]], and was flown by a [[Taiwan]]ese crew. That aircraft had a color scheme different from the rest of the Air Viet Nam fleet.\n\nIn an unusual joint venture, Air Viet Nam was joined by [[Continental Air Services, Inc|Continental Air Services]] (CASI), a subsidiary airline of [[Continental Airlines]] set up to provide operations and airlift support in [[Southeast Asia]], in the mid-1960s. Under this agreement, CASI would share passengers and cargo routes with Air Viet Nam on certain domestic and international routes. In addition, CASI and Air Viet Nam would share [[hangar]]s and flight lines.  CASI also picked up a portion of aircraft maintenance. Heavy engine overhaul was done in [[Hong Kong]], by China Airlines, and some in [[Taiwan]], by [[Air Asia (Taiwan)|Air Asia]] (a subsidiary of [[Air America (airline)|Air America]]). CASI paid a portion of its revenues to Air Viet Nam for the routes and privileges. Many CASI aircraft operating from [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] carried the [[dragon]]/[[flag]] [[roundel]] of Air Viet Nam.\n\nIn 1974, Air Vietnam had 1 B747-200 leased from Air France\n\n=== Fall of Saigon ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\nDuring the [[Fall of Saigon]] and the impending invasion of [[North Vietnam]] into [[South Vietnam]], Air Viet Nam decided to assist and help all South Vietnamese citizens to escape to neighboring countries. Many of their pilots and crew worked long hours ferrying South Vietnamese citizens to [[Thailand]], Taiwan, the [[Philippines]], and other [[Southeast Asia]]n countries to escape the invading North Vietnamese army.\n\nOne Air Vietnam [[Boeing 727]] was returned to Vietnam from [[Hong Kong]] in early June 1975, by lead pilot Huynh Minh Boong, who had married [[General]] [[Pham Hung]]'s sister. [[Captain (airlines)|Captain]] [[Huynh Minh Boong]] with over 10,000 flight hours, was a pilot on [[Vietnam Airlines]] overseas flights due to his [[IATA]] credentials, then in early 1980 he was appointed as head of training of Vietnam Airlines, now retired and lives in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].\n\nThe only commercial jet airplanes transferred from Air Vietnam to Vietnam Airlines are: one (1)  [[Boeing 707]] and one (1) [[Boeing 727]]-100.\n\n==Destinations==\nAccording to a timetable published in 1969 Air Vietnam served these cities:\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n*{{flag|ROC|name=China}} ([[Free area of the Republic of China|Fukien and Formosa area]])<!--ROC was referred to as China before the 1970s.

It can be presumed that some senior grades of pilot and crew existed, although how these were indicated is not clear.\n\nStewardesses, or [[flight attendant]]s, wore a gold or bronze metal [[wing]] with embossed/relief dragon/flag roundel. Uniforms consisted of the traditional [[\u00c1o d\u00e0i]]s in a variety of colors.\n\n==Aircraft livery==\nAir Vietnam aircraft generally had a single or dual green stripe down the main [[fuselage]]. The top fuselage was generally white with a natural metal (silver) lower. The colorful dragon/flag roundel appeared in various sizes, most often on the tail [[rudder]]. Sometimes the roundel would appear alone and occasionally with a dual green stripe. The wording \"Air Viet Nam\" appeared in red/orange lettering above the windows on all large aircraft except the 727s, which were marked \"Hang Kh\u00f4ng Viet Nam\". Exceptions to these schemes included the early Viscount aircraft, which were all white with a green stripe and had the roundel appearing on the front fuselage. The Chinese C-46 aircraft had a blue and red nose-side stripe with the roundel appearing on the rudder.\n\n==Marketing==\nAdvertisements used from the mid-1960s included South Vietnamese [[Olympic Games|Olympians]], such as Thach Thi Ngoc, and flamboyant military officer [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]], whose wife [[Madame Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] was a flight stewardess before they were married. These celebrities promoted the airline's operation of Viscounts on the \"Green Dragon Route\", alternating flights from Saigon to [[Siem Reap]], [[Cambodia]]; [[Bangkok]], Thailand; and Hong Kong. Timetables indicate domestic routes covering destinations as far north as [[Hu\u1ebf]], as far south as [[Ca Mau|C\u00e0 Mau]], and including almost every major city in between.\n\n==Incidents and accidents==\n;16 August 1954: [[Bristol Freighter]] 21E F-VNAI crashed into the [[Mekong River]] while on approach to [[Pakxe|Pakse]] for an emergency landing due to engine problems, killing 47 of 55 on board.

[[Captain (airlines)|Captain]] [[Huynh Minh Boong]] with over 10,000 flight hours, was a pilot on [[Vietnam Airlines]] overseas flights due to his [[IATA]] credentials, then in early 1980 he was appointed as head of training of Vietnam Airlines, now retired and lives in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].\n\nThe only commercial jet airplanes transferred from Air Vietnam to Vietnam Airlines are: one (1)  [[Boeing 707]] and one (1) [[Boeing 727]]-100.\n\n==Destinations==\nAccording to a timetable published in 1969 Air Vietnam served these cities:\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n*{{flag|ROC|name=China}} ([[Free area of the Republic of China|Fukien and Formosa area]])<!--ROC was referred to as China before the 1970s.

However, one American CASI pilot reported that the Taiwanese crew of the leased C-46 always parked its aircraft separately at [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] and kept its distance from the regular Air Viet Nam and CASI crews.\n\n===Uniforms===\nPilots for Air Viet Nam wore a distinctive gold/bronze wing with a center shield containing a colored enamel version of the dragon/flag. It can be presumed that some senior grades of pilot and crew existed, although how these were indicated is not clear.\n\nStewardesses, or [[flight attendant]]s, wore a gold or bronze metal [[wing]] with embossed/relief dragon/flag roundel. Uniforms consisted of the traditional [[\u00c1o d\u00e0i]]s in a variety of colors.\n\n==Aircraft livery==\nAir Vietnam aircraft generally had a single or dual green stripe down the main [[fuselage]]. The top fuselage was generally white with a natural metal (silver) lower. The colorful dragon/flag roundel appeared in various sizes, most often on the tail [[rudder]]. Sometimes the roundel would appear alone and occasionally with a dual green stripe. The wording \"Air Viet Nam\" appeared in red/orange lettering above the windows on all large aircraft except the 727s, which were marked \"Hang Kh\u00f4ng Viet Nam\". Exceptions to these schemes included the early Viscount aircraft, which were all white with a green stripe and had the roundel appearing on the front fuselage. The Chinese C-46 aircraft had a blue and red nose-side stripe with the roundel appearing on the rudder.\n\n==Marketing==\nAdvertisements used from the mid-1960s included South Vietnamese [[Olympic Games|Olympians]], such as Thach Thi Ngoc, and flamboyant military officer [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]], whose wife [[Madame Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] was a flight stewardess before they were married. These celebrities promoted the airline's operation of Viscounts on the \"Green Dragon Route\", alternating flights from Saigon to [[Siem Reap]], [[Cambodia]]; [[Bangkok]], Thailand; and Hong Kong. Timetables indicate domestic routes covering destinations as far north as [[Hu\u1ebf]], as far south as [[Ca Mau|C\u00e0 Mau]], and including almost every major city in between.\n\n==Incidents and accidents==\n;16 August 1954: [[Bristol Freighter]] 21E F-VNAI crashed into the [[Mekong River]] while on approach to [[Pakxe|Pakse]] for an emergency landing due to engine problems, killing 47 of 55 on board.
