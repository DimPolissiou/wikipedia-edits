Today, they control many of the country's largest media groups. Although spread throughout India, historically they have been most concentrated in [[Kolkata]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]], [[Delhi]], [[Nagpur]] and the hinterlands of central and eastern India.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''Marwari'' once referred to the area encompassed by the former [[princely state]] of [[Marwar]], also called the [[Jodhpur]] region of southwest Rajasthan in India. It has evolved to be a designation for the [[Rajasthani people]] in general but it is used particularly with reference to certain [[j\u0101ti]]s that fall within the [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] community.

The changed focus of migration was also encouraged by the British establishment of new trading routes and centres, as well as by the declining political significance of the Rajput courts whose famed conspicuous consumption had been supported by Marwari money. The community welcomed the relative safety that the British presence offered, as well as the commercial and legal frameworks that they provided and which were more favourable to Marwari activities than the systems prevalent during the earlier period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and Rajput rule.<ref name=Kudaisya2009p88>{{cite book |chapter=Marwari and Chettiar Merchants. 1850s-1950s: Comparative Trajectories |first=Medha M. |last=Kudaisya |title=Chinese and Indian Business: Historical Antecedents |editor1-first=Medha M. |editor1-last=Kudaisya |editor2-first=Chin-Keong |editor2-last=Ng |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-04-17279-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQJfjnWly5wC&pg=PA88 |page=88 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Marwari [[Jagat Seth]] family served as bankers to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].\n\n===British era===\nAfter the decline of Mughal authority in Bengal, Marwari traders, bankers and financiers migrated to the growing British power in Calcutta.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcNdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|title=Commodifying Everything : Relationships of the Market.|last=Strasser|first=Susan|year=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-1-13670-685-1|location=Hoboken|page=197}}</ref> There were particularly significant population shifts to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] between 1835-1850 and Kolkata from the 1870s, as well as to [[Chennai|Madras]].<ref name=Kudaisya2009p88/> They continued to spread into areas of British control throughout the nineteenth century, becoming established as ''sahukars'' (moneylenders) and inland trade-brokers in central India and Maharashtra.

Their language, also called [[Marwari language|Marwari]], comes under the umbrella of [[Rajasthani language]]s, which is part of the Western Zone of [[Indo-Aryan languages]].\n\nThey have been a highly successful business community, first as inland traders during the era of [[Rajput kingdoms]], and later also as investors in industrial production and other sectors. Today, they control many of the country's largest media groups. Although spread throughout India, historically they have been most concentrated in [[Kolkata]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]], [[Delhi]], [[Nagpur]] and the hinterlands of central and eastern India.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''Marwari'' once referred to the area encompassed by the former [[princely state]] of [[Marwar]], also called the [[Jodhpur]] region of southwest Rajasthan in India. It has evolved to be a designation for the [[Rajasthani people]] in general but it is used particularly with reference to certain [[j\u0101ti]]s that fall within the [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] community.

The possible causes of this trait include the proximity of their homeland to the major [Ganges]-[Yamuna] trade route; movement to escape famine; and the encouragement given to them by various rulers of northern India who saw advantages in having their skills in banking and finance.<ref name=Kudaisya2009p87/>\n\nThe pattern of Marwari migration became increasingly divergent following the decline in wars between Rajput kingdoms, which the Marwaris had helped to finance, and the decreasing influence of the community over the North Indian caravan trading routes that resulted from the British establishing themselves in the region. The changed focus of migration was also encouraged by the British establishment of new trading routes and centres, as well as by the declining political significance of the Rajput courts whose famed conspicuous consumption had been supported by Marwari money. The community welcomed the relative safety that the British presence offered, as well as the commercial and legal frameworks that they provided and which were more favourable to Marwari activities than the systems prevalent during the earlier period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and Rajput rule.<ref name=Kudaisya2009p88>{{cite book |chapter=Marwari and Chettiar Merchants. 1850s-1950s: Comparative Trajectories |first=Medha M. |last=Kudaisya |title=Chinese and Indian Business: Historical Antecedents |editor1-first=Medha M. |editor1-last=Kudaisya |editor2-first=Chin-Keong |editor2-last=Ng |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-04-17279-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQJfjnWly5wC&pg=PA88 |page=88 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Marwari [[Jagat Seth]] family served as bankers to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].\n\n===British era===\nAfter the decline of Mughal authority in Bengal, Marwari traders, bankers and financiers migrated to the growing British power in Calcutta.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcNdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|title=Commodifying Everything : Relationships of the Market.|last=Strasser|first=Susan|year=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-1-13670-685-1|location=Hoboken|page=197}}</ref> There were particularly significant population shifts to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] between 1835-1850 and Kolkata from the 1870s, as well as to [[Chennai|Madras]].<ref name=Kudaisya2009p88/> They continued to spread into areas of British control throughout the nineteenth century, becoming established as ''sahukars'' (moneylenders) and inland trade-brokers in central India and Maharashtra.

Hardgrove notes that they are \"known across India for their success in business and industry , and often despised and severely criticised by other Indians for their alleged corruption and social conservatism\". The latter aspect is particularly evident in the status of women within the Marwari community: it is probably correct that, generally speaking, they are less educated than those of even other wealthy communities and if they have any form of further education it tends not to be with the aim of pursuing a career but rather of enhancing domestic life. She says that \"The main duty for Marwari women, it would seem, is to provide a stable household life for their husbands, sons and brothers-in-law\", although she acknowledges that some such women have in recent years been attempting to carve out roles in the wider world through engagement in charitable ventures and even running their own businesses.<ref name=\"hardgrove\"/>\n\n==Notable people==\n<!--Arranged alphabetically as per surname-->\n*[[Nidhhi Agerwal]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Nidhhi Agerwal: I am a Tollywood buff who grew up watching Telugu films dubbed in Hindi - Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/nidhhi-agerwal-i-am-a-tollywood-buff-who-grew-up-watching-telugu-films-dubbed-in-hindi/articleshow/61660243.cms |accessdate=12 November 2019 |work=The Times of India |language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Janaki Devi Bajaj]]<ref name=\"MarwariHeritage\"/>\n*[[Rahul Bajaj]]<ref name=\"MarwariHeritage\"/>\n*[[Shobhana Bhartia]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jain |first1=Gunjan |title=Shobhana Bhartia: (Penguin Petit) |date=2018 |publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited |isbn=9789353054175 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=voJ8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=shobhana+bhartia+marwari#v=onepage&q=shobhana%20bhartia%20marwari&f=false |accessdate=12 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Kumar Mangalam Birla]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The story of the first couple of the Birla empire |url=https://www.rediff.com/money/slide-show/slide-show-1-the-story-of-the-first-couple-of-the-birla-empire/20110706.htm |accessdate=12 November 2019 |work=Rediff |date=6 June 2011 |language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Jagmohan Dalmiya]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Choudhury |first1=Angikaar |title=Jagmohan Dalmiya (1940-2015): The man who symbolised India's clout in world cricket |url=https://scroll.in/field/756893/jagmohan-dalmiya-1940-2015-the-man-who-symbolised-india-s-clout-in-world-cricket |accessdate=12 November 2019 |work=Scroll.in |date=21 September 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Ritu Dalmia]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dalmia |first1=Ritu |title=My freedom to love: 'I was 23 when I realised I was gay.

The bells are rung in the English [[change ringing]] tradition, but with ropes which cause the bell clapper to strike the inside of the bell (as opposed to [[full circle ringing]]). They are rung by two people each ringing four bells. The bells are rung at selected Sunday services, for weddings and funerals, and for special occasions. When required, hymns and other melodies can also be rung.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Bells of St John's |url=https://www.stjohnscanberra.org/the-bells |publisher=St John's Canberra |date= |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Church precinct==\n[[File:St John the Baptist Church and graves in Reid, ACT.jpg|thumb|Cemetery and churchyard]]\n\n===Churchyard===\nSt John's churchyard contains Canberra's original cemetery. The burials in St John's churchyard date from 1844 onwards.\n\nThe mortal remains of many pioneers of the Canberra district are interred at St John's. They include the church's long-serving 19th-century rector, the Revd [[Pierce Galliard Smith]], and Colonel [[Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787-1873)|John George Nathaniel Gibbes]], who occupied [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]] homestead from 1859 until his death 14 years later. Gibbes was reputed to be the illegitimate son of a royal duke. Coincidentally, lying close to Gibbes' grave is the final resting place of another person with a link to the British throne, albeit one greatly separated in time and circumstance from that of the colonel. That person is [[Viscount Dunrossil]], a former [[Governor-General of Australia]], who died in office in 1961.\n\nAlso interred in the churchyard are the remains of Colonel Gibbes' wife, Elizabeth, his son Augustus Gibbes (Yarralumla's proprietor from 1859 to 1881), his grandson Henry Edmund Gibbes, and his great-grandson, the Australian air ace [[Bobby Gibbes]] DSO, DFC and bar \u2014 as well as St Christopher Battye and members of the pioneering McDonald, Guise, Shumack and Campbell families. The McDonalds are of Cranachan, Inverness Shire, Scotland, the same lineage as Flora Hannah McKillop (McDonald), mother of the Australian saint Mary McKillop.

The building was constructed from rubble and bluestone quarried locally, with shingle roof and the walls two feet thick to afford protection from Canberra\u2019s harsh climate.<ref>{{cite web |title=St John's Schoolhouse Museum |url=https://www.stjohnscanberra.org/st-johns-schoolhouse |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first students arrived in 1845 and it closed as a school in 1907. In 1969 it opened as a museum. It is set up to depict schooling in the 1870s.

That person is [[Viscount Dunrossil]], a former [[Governor-General of Australia]], who died in office in 1961.\n\nAlso interred in the churchyard are the remains of Colonel Gibbes' wife, Elizabeth, his son Augustus Gibbes (Yarralumla's proprietor from 1859 to 1881), his grandson Henry Edmund Gibbes, and his great-grandson, the Australian air ace [[Bobby Gibbes]] DSO, DFC and bar \u2014 as well as St Christopher Battye and members of the pioneering McDonald, Guise, Shumack and Campbell families.

Since August 2006, he has been General Manager of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nWhile in high school, Gelb began his association with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] as an usher. At age 17, Gelb began his career in classical music as office boy to [[impresario]] [[Sol Hurok]].\n\nGelb managed the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]\u2019s 1979 tour to China at the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The following year Gelb became [[Vladimir Horowitz]]'s manager. Gelb assisted the pianist in the revival of his performing career, and managed his return to Russia in 1986. In partnership with the Chinese government, Gelb commissioned the premiere of [[Tan Dun]]'s ''Symphony 1997'', featuring [[Yo-Yo Ma]], which was performed at the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong to China]].\n\nIn 1982, Gelb founded, and served as president of, CAMI Video, a division of [[Columbia Artists Management]]. In this capacity, he served for six years as executive producer of \"The Metropolitan Opera Presents\", the Met's series of televised opera broadcasts. Gelb produced 25 televised productions for the Met, including the 1990 telecast of [[Richard Wagner]]\u2019s complete ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'', conducted by [[James Levine]]. While at CAMI, Gelb produced and occasionally directed more than 50 programs for television featuring such artists as [[Herbert von Karajan]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]].\n\nIn 1992, Gelb produced both the stage and film versions of [[Julie Taymor]]\u2019s first opera production, ''Oedipus Rex'', for [[Seiji Ozawa]]\u2019s [[Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto|Saito Kinen Festival]]. Also for that Japanese festival, in 1994 he commissioned an early opera staging by [[Robert Lepage]], ''La Damnation de Faust''. A re-conceived version of that production was later presented at the Met in the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n===Sony Classical===\nFrom 1995 until joining the Met, Gelb was president of [[Sony Classical Records]]. Gelb pursued a strategy of emphasizing [[crossover (music)|crossover]] music over mainstream [[European classical music|classical]] repertoire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/CLASSICAL-MUSIC-TUNING-UP-FOR-THE-21ST-CENTURY-2823078.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217082154/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2002%2F07%2F16%2FDD222360.DTL&type=music|url-status=dead|title=CLASSICAL MUSIC: TUNING UP FOR THE 21ST CENTURY / Crossover works find an audience / But some say these projects are less interesting artistically|first=Steven|last=Winn|date=Jul 16, 2002|archivedate=Feb 17, 2006|website=SFGate|accessdate=Nov 21, 2019}}</ref>  Examples include cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who was encouraged to record [[Americana (music)|Americana]], including an album with fiddler and composer [[Mark O'Connor]] and double-bassist and composer [[Edgar Meyer]], ''Appalachia Waltz''; electronic composer [[Vangelis]], who recorded the choral symphony ''[[Mythodea]]''; and [[Charlotte Church]], a pop artist who started her career as a classical singer.<ref name=\"scena\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scena.org/columns/lebrecht/041111-NL-metopera.html |title=Norman Lebrecht, \"How the Met was fixed\". ''La Scena Musicale'', 11 November 2004 |publisher=Scena.org |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\nGelb expanded the focus of recording projects to include film music, among them the Academy Award-winning scores for ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' by Tan Dun, ''[[The Red Violin]]'' by [[John Corigliano]], and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', by [[James Horner]], while preserving the label\u2019s tradition of recording Broadway musicals and maintaining a catalogue of classical works. Gelb also initiated Sony Classical\u2019s program of commissioning new music.\n\n===Metropolitan Opera===\nGelb became the 16th General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera, taking over from [[Joseph Volpe (opera)|Joseph Volpe]], on August 1, 2006. He launched the beginning of his tenure with several new productions, including ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' directed by [[Anthony Minghella]]; ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' by [[Bartlett Sher]]; and of [[Tan Dun]]'s new opera ''[[The First Emperor]]'' directed by [[Zhang Yimou]].\n\nGelb launched a number of new ventures for the Met, capitalizing on new media technology to distribute Met performances to a wider global audience. This became [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|''The Met: Live in HD'']] series, the Met becoming the first performing arts company to offer live high definition broadcasts of its operas to cinemas and other performing arts centres in many countries of the world. The series gained both a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and an [[Emmy Award]]. Several digitally-recorded performances are later offered on public television stations and released on [[DVD]]s for purchase.\n\nIn September 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio (now [[SiriusXM]]) launched Metropolitan Opera Radio, broadcasting live performances each week as well as historic performances from the Met\u2019s radio archive. The Met also presents free, live audio streaming of performances from its website once a week. Other initiatives launched by Gelb include a commissioning program for new operas; free dress rehearsals for the public; a free live transmission of the opening-night performance onto screens at [[Times Square]] and [[Lincoln Center]] Plaza; a rush tickets program that offers select orchestra seats for weekday and weekend performances at reduced prices; and the Arnold and Marie Schwartz Gallery Met, a contemporary art exhibition space in the Met lobby that presents new work connected to Met productions by artists that have included [[John Currin]], [[William Kentridge]], [[Julie Mehretu]], [[Elizabeth Peyton]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Dana Schutz]].\n\nGelb asserted the importance of his combining the roles of financial and general management with that of being overall creative director. He described plans to stage more productions each year but in an era of computer-generated visual effects, possibly no longer needing \"tons of scenery\" built and retained for each new production. These were among other plans for drawing in new (and younger) audiences without deterring the older opera lovers, the wealth and patronage of some of whom sustains the most lavish privately financed opera house in the world.\n\nDuring his tenure at the Met, Gelb has spearheaded the production of contemporary works, including the staging of two of [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]'s operas, ''Doctor Atomic'' and ''Nixon in China'', with a third, ''The Death of Klinghoffer'', planned for autumn 2014. His other ideas have included an annual \"family-oriented\" presentation at [[Christmas]] time, and collaborations with the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]] of [[Lincoln Center]] to develop newer musical works with musicians such as [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Rachel Portman]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/24/bmopera24.xml |title=Rupert Christiansen, \"Met's new man is aiming for the stars\", ''Telegraph'', 24 June 2006 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In January 2007 Gelb announced a commission for a new opera from [[Osvaldo Golijov]], tentatively scheduled for the 2010-11 season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|title=New Operas at the Met: What Works?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/arts/music/11oper.html?ex=1326171600&en=4f4825d4f3de1767&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|work=New York Times|date=January 22, 2007|page=E1|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> However, following the death in 2008 of [[Anthony Minghella]] who was to have written the [[libretto]], the premiere was postponed to 2018.<ref>Lawless, Jill.

Gelb received a Peabody Award for his four-part television series ''Marsalis on Music'' (1995), in which jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis introduces young audiences to the full experience of classical music and jazz. \n\nGelb also won Peabody Awards for the 1986 televised concert ''Horowitz in Moscow'' and for the Met\u2019s ''Live in HD'' series. In 2001, he co-directed and produced a 90-minute documentary entitled ''Recording The Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks'', about the making of the hit Broadway show\u2019s cast album. The film was awarded a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in 2002. Three of the Met\u2019s ''Live in HD'' productions released on DVD\u2014John Adams\u2019s ''Doctor Atomic'', Wagner\u2019s ''Ring'' cycle, and Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s ''The Tempest'' (the last two both directed by Robert Lepage)\u2014won consecutive Grammys for best opera recording for the company and for Gelb as executive producer between 2011 and 2013. He also received the Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award for the ''Live in HD'' series in 2011.\n\n''[[Time magazine|TIME]]'' magazine named Gelb a 2008 honoree of the [[Time 100]] list of the world\u2019s most influential people. In 2010, France honored him as an Officier dans l\u2019[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], and in 2012 he received the Diplomacy Award of the Foreign Policy Association. In 2013, Gelb received the Sanford Prize from the [[Yale School of Music]], and was named Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur by the French President. Gelb has received [[honorary degrees|honorary doctorates]] from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and from the [[William E. Macaulay Honors College]] of the [[City University of New York]]. In 2019, he received the Gold Medal from the [[National Institute of Social Sciences]].\n\n==Controversy==\nGelb's history at Sony Classical caused concern among critics when he was appointed to take over as General Manager at the Metropolitan Opera. He responded to fears that he would dilute the Met's artistic standards as he seeks a wider audience for the company, saying \u201cI think what I\u2019m doing is exactly what the Met engaged me to do, which is build bridges to a broader public.

Since August 2006, he has been General Manager of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nWhile in high school, Gelb began his association with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] as an usher. At age 17, Gelb began his career in classical music as office boy to [[impresario]] [[Sol Hurok]].\n\nGelb managed the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]\u2019s 1979 tour to China at the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The following year Gelb became [[Vladimir Horowitz]]'s manager. Gelb assisted the pianist in the revival of his performing career, and managed his return to Russia in 1986. In partnership with the Chinese government, Gelb commissioned the premiere of [[Tan Dun]]'s ''Symphony 1997'', featuring [[Yo-Yo Ma]], which was performed at the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong to China]].\n\nIn 1982, Gelb founded, and served as president of, CAMI Video, a division of [[Columbia Artists Management]]. In this capacity, he served for six years as executive producer of \"The Metropolitan Opera Presents\", the Met's series of televised opera broadcasts. Gelb produced 25 televised productions for the Met, including the 1990 telecast of [[Richard Wagner]]\u2019s complete ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'', conducted by [[James Levine]]. While at CAMI, Gelb produced and occasionally directed more than 50 programs for television featuring such artists as [[Herbert von Karajan]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]].\n\nIn 1992, Gelb produced both the stage and film versions of [[Julie Taymor]]\u2019s first opera production, ''Oedipus Rex'', for [[Seiji Ozawa]]\u2019s [[Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto|Saito Kinen Festival]]. Also for that Japanese festival, in 1994 he commissioned an early opera staging by [[Robert Lepage]], ''La Damnation de Faust''. A re-conceived version of that production was later presented at the Met in the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n===Sony Classical===\nFrom 1995 until joining the Met, Gelb was president of [[Sony Classical Records]]. Gelb pursued a strategy of emphasizing [[crossover (music)|crossover]] music over mainstream [[European classical music|classical]] repertoire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/CLASSICAL-MUSIC-TUNING-UP-FOR-THE-21ST-CENTURY-2823078.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217082154/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2002%2F07%2F16%2FDD222360.DTL&type=music|url-status=dead|title=CLASSICAL MUSIC: TUNING UP FOR THE 21ST CENTURY / Crossover works find an audience / But some say these projects are less interesting artistically|first=Steven|last=Winn|date=Jul 16, 2002|archivedate=Feb 17, 2006|website=SFGate|accessdate=Nov 21, 2019}}</ref>  Examples include cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who was encouraged to record [[Americana (music)|Americana]], including an album with fiddler and composer [[Mark O'Connor]] and double-bassist and composer [[Edgar Meyer]], ''Appalachia Waltz''; electronic composer [[Vangelis]], who recorded the choral symphony ''[[Mythodea]]''; and [[Charlotte Church]], a pop artist who started her career as a classical singer.<ref name=\"scena\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scena.org/columns/lebrecht/041111-NL-metopera.html |title=Norman Lebrecht, \"How the Met was fixed\". ''La Scena Musicale'', 11 November 2004 |publisher=Scena.org |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\nGelb expanded the focus of recording projects to include film music, among them the Academy Award-winning scores for ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' by Tan Dun, ''[[The Red Violin]]'' by [[John Corigliano]], and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', by [[James Horner]], while preserving the label\u2019s tradition of recording Broadway musicals and maintaining a catalogue of classical works. Gelb also initiated Sony Classical\u2019s program of commissioning new music.\n\n===Metropolitan Opera===\nGelb became the 16th General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera, taking over from [[Joseph Volpe (opera)|Joseph Volpe]], on August 1, 2006. He launched the beginning of his tenure with several new productions, including ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' directed by [[Anthony Minghella]]; ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' by [[Bartlett Sher]]; and of [[Tan Dun]]'s new opera ''[[The First Emperor]]'' directed by [[Zhang Yimou]].\n\nGelb launched a number of new ventures for the Met, capitalizing on new media technology to distribute Met performances to a wider global audience. This became [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|''The Met: Live in HD'']] series, the Met becoming the first performing arts company to offer live high definition broadcasts of its operas to cinemas and other performing arts centres in many countries of the world. The series gained both a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and an [[Emmy Award]]. Several digitally-recorded performances are later offered on public television stations and released on [[DVD]]s for purchase.\n\nIn September 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio (now [[SiriusXM]]) launched Metropolitan Opera Radio, broadcasting live performances each week as well as historic performances from the Met\u2019s radio archive. The Met also presents free, live audio streaming of performances from its website once a week. Other initiatives launched by Gelb include a commissioning program for new operas; free dress rehearsals for the public; a free live transmission of the opening-night performance onto screens at [[Times Square]] and [[Lincoln Center]] Plaza; a rush tickets program that offers select orchestra seats for weekday and weekend performances at reduced prices; and the Arnold and Marie Schwartz Gallery Met, a contemporary art exhibition space in the Met lobby that presents new work connected to Met productions by artists that have included [[John Currin]], [[William Kentridge]], [[Julie Mehretu]], [[Elizabeth Peyton]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Dana Schutz]].\n\nGelb asserted the importance of his combining the roles of financial and general management with that of being overall creative director. He described plans to stage more productions each year but in an era of computer-generated visual effects, possibly no longer needing \"tons of scenery\" built and retained for each new production. These were among other plans for drawing in new (and younger) audiences without deterring the older opera lovers, the wealth and patronage of some of whom sustains the most lavish privately financed opera house in the world.\n\nDuring his tenure at the Met, Gelb has spearheaded the production of contemporary works, including the staging of two of [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]'s operas, ''Doctor Atomic'' and ''Nixon in China'', with a third, ''The Death of Klinghoffer'', planned for autumn 2014. His other ideas have included an annual \"family-oriented\" presentation at [[Christmas]] time, and collaborations with the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]] of [[Lincoln Center]] to develop newer musical works with musicians such as [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Rachel Portman]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/24/bmopera24.xml |title=Rupert Christiansen, \"Met's new man is aiming for the stars\", ''Telegraph'', 24 June 2006 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In January 2007 Gelb announced a commission for a new opera from [[Osvaldo Golijov]], tentatively scheduled for the 2010-11 season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|title=New Operas at the Met: What Works?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/arts/music/11oper.html?ex=1326171600&en=4f4825d4f3de1767&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|work=New York Times|date=January 22, 2007|page=E1|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> However, following the death in 2008 of [[Anthony Minghella]] who was to have written the [[libretto]], the premiere was postponed to 2018.<ref>Lawless, Jill.

Gelb received a Peabody Award for his four-part television series ''Marsalis on Music'' (1995), in which jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis introduces young audiences to the full experience of classical music and jazz. Gelb also won Peabody Awards for the 1986 televised concert ''Horowitz in Moscow'' and for the Met\u2019s ''Live in HD'' series. In 2001, he co-directed and produced a 90-minute documentary entitled ''Recording The Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks'', about the making of the hit Broadway show\u2019s cast album. The film was awarded a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in 2002. Three of the Met\u2019s ''Live in HD'' productions released on DVD\u2014John Adams\u2019s ''Doctor Atomic'', Wagner\u2019s ''Ring'' cycle, and Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s ''The Tempest'' (the last two both directed by Robert Lepage)\u2014won consecutive Grammys for best opera recording for the company and for Gelb as executive producer between 2011 and 2013. He also received the Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award for the ''Live in HD'' series in 2011.\n\n''[[Time magazine|TIME]]'' magazine named Gelb a 2008 honoree of the [[Time 100]] list of the world\u2019s most influential people. In 2010, France honored him as an Officier dans l\u2019[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], and in 2012 he received the Diplomacy Award of the Foreign Policy Association. In 2013, Gelb received the Sanford Prize from the [[Yale School of Music]], and was named Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur by the French President. Gelb has received [[honorary degrees|honorary doctorates]] from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and from the [[William E. Macaulay Honors College]] of the [[City University of New York]]. In 2019, he received the Gold Medal from the [[National Institute of Social Sciences]].\n\n==Controversy==\nGelb's history at Sony Classical caused concern among critics when he was appointed to take over as General Manager at the Metropolitan Opera. He responded to fears that he would dilute the Met's artistic standards as he seeks a wider audience for the company, saying \u201cI think what I\u2019m doing is exactly what the Met engaged me to do, which is build bridges to a broader public. This is not about dumbing down the Met, it\u2019s just making it accessible.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Wakin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Multiplex as Opera House: Will They Serve Popcorn?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/07/arts/music/07unio.html?ex=1315281600&en=7e7b8a87298a10dd&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|work=New York Times|date=September 7, 2006|page=B1|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nGelb's relationship with the press became strained during his time at the Metropolitan Opera, that his new production of ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and, by extension his tenure as the company's general manager, received poor reviews.

In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978. In 1980 production of the small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range and 128 production finally ended in 1985.<ref name=Greats/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Road test==\nThe British \"[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]\" magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch.  The car had a top speed of {{convert|85.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{convert|27.5|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded.

The layout often required the engine be removed to service the clutch.<ref name=\"dante1\">{{cite web |title=Dante Giacosa |website=Fiat 500 USA |url=http://www.fiat500usa.com/2009/02/dante-giacosa.html}}</ref>\n\nAs engineered by [[Dante Giacosa]], the 128 featured a transverse-mounted [[engine]] with unequal length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism &mdash; an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model for a full five years, the [[Autobianchi Primula|Primula]] from its less market-critical subsidiary, [[Autobianchi]].<ref name=\"AU71.9\">[[#AU71|Becker]], p. 79</ref> The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting an electrically controlled cooling fan toward fresh air flow.

Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978.

The palace was the residence of the [[Doge of Venice]], the supreme authority of the former [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. It was founded in 1340, and extended and modified in the following centuries. It became a museum in 1923, and is one of the 11 museums run by the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:MZK 001 Nr 09 Eine Ansicht des Dogenpalastes - Fig. 01 Ende 14. Jhdt.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the Doge's Palace, late 14th century]]\nIn 810, Doge [[Agnello Participazio]] moved the seat of government from the island of [[Malamocco]] to the area of the present-day [[Rialto]], when it was decided a ''palatium duci'' ([[Latin]] for \"ducal palace\") should be built. However, no trace remains of that 9th-century  building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century by a fire. The following reconstruction works were undertaken at the behest of Doge [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u20131178). A great reformer, he would drastically change the entire layout of the [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]]. The new palace was built out of fortresses, one fa\u00e7ade to the Piazzetta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. Although only few traces remain of that palace, some [[Byzantine-Venetian architecture]] characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in [[Istrian stone]] and some [[Herringbone pattern|herring-bone pattern]] brick paving.\n\nPolitical changes in the mid-13th century led to the need to re-think the palace's structure due to the considerable increase in the number of the Great Council's members. The new Gothic palace's constructions started around 1340, focusing mostly on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424 did Doge [[Francesco Foscari]] decide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, serving as law-courts, and with a ground floor arcade on the outside, open first floor loggias running along the fa\u00e7ade, and the internal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442).\n\nIn 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the Doge's Apartments were. Once again, an important reconstruction became necessary and was commissioned from Antonio Rizzo, who would introduce the new [[Renaissance]] language to the building's architecture. An entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the [[Ponte della Paglia]], with the official rooms of the government decorated with works commissioned from [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giorgione]], [[Alvise Vivarini]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].\n\nAnother huge fire in 1547 destroyed some of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Refurbishment works were being held at the palace when in 1577 a third fire destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber, together with works by [[Gentile da Fabriano]], [[Pisanello]], [[Alvise Vivarini]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Pordenone]], and [[Titian]]. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original [[Gothic style]], despite the submission of a neo-classical alternative designs by the influential [[Renaissance]] architect [[Andrea Palladio]]. However, there are some classical features \u2014 for example, since the 16th century, the palace has been linked to the prison by the [[Bridge of Sighs]].\n\nAs well as being the ducal residence, the palace housed political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|Napoleonic occupation of the city]] in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subjected first to French rule, then to Austrian, and finally in 1866 [[Risorgimento|it became part]] of Italy. Over this period, the palace was occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] and other important cultural institutions within the city.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which has been under the management of the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]] since 2008.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Exterior ===\n[[File:Piazzetta San Marco Venice BLS.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Facing the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] on the Piazzetta San Marco, with Doge's Palace on the left.]]\n[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3325.jpg|thumbnail|Palazzo Ducale, south colonnade, Venice, Italy. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nThe oldest part of the palace is the wing overlooking the lagoon, the corners of which are decorated with 14th-century sculptures, thought to be by [[Filippo Calendario]] and various Lombard artists such as Matteo Raverti and [[Antonio Bregno]]. The ground floor arcade and the [[loggia]] above are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century capitals, some of which were replaced with copies during the 19th century.\n\nIn 1438\u20131442,  Giovanni Bon  and [[Bartolomeo Bon]] built and adorned the Porta della Carta, which served as the ceremonial entrance to the building. The name of the gateway probably derives either from the fact that this was the area where public scribes set up their desks, or from the nearby location of the ''cartabum'', the archives of state documents. Flanked by [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] pinnacles, with two figures of the ''Cardinal Virtues'' per side, the gateway is crowned by a bust of [[Mark the Evangelist]] over which rises a statue of ''Justice'' with her traditional symbols of sword and scales. In the space above the cornice, there is a sculptural portrait of the Doge [[Francesco Foscari]] kneeling before the [[Lion of Saint Mark]]. This is, however, a 19th-century work by [[Luigi Ferrari]], created to replace the original destroyed in 1797.\n\nToday, the public entrance to the Doge's Palace is via the Porta del Frumento, on the waterfront side of the building.\n\n=== Courtyard ===\n[[File:Doge's Palace Courtyard BLS.jpg|thumbnail|Courtyard of the Doge's Palace, facing the San Marco basilica.]]\n[[File:Doge's Palace Scala dei Giganti BLS.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Scala dei Giganti'', flanked by Mars and Neptune.]]\nThe north side of the courtyard is closed by the junction between the palace and [[St. Mark\u2019s Basilica]], which used to be the [[Doge]]'s chapel. At the center of the courtyard stand two well-heads dating from the mid-16th century.\n\nIn 1485, the Great Council decided that a ceremonial staircase should be built within the courtyard. The design envisaged a straight axis with the rounded Foscari Arch, with alternate bands of [[Istrian stone]] and [[red Verona marble]], linking the staircase to the Porta della Carta, and thus producing one single monumental approach from the Piazza into the heart of the building. Since 1567, the Giants\u2019 Staircase is guarded by [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]]'s two colossal statues of ''Mars'' and ''Neptune'', which represents Venice\u2019s power by land and by sea, and therefore the reason for its name. Members of the Senate gathered before government meetings in the Senator\u2019s Courtyard, to the right of the Giants\u2019 Staircase.\n\n=== Museo dell'Opera ===\nOver the centuries, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been restructured and restored countless times. Due to fires, structural failures, and infiltrations, and new organizational requirements and modifications or complete overhaulings of the ornamental trappings there was hardly a moment in which some kind of works have not been under way at the building. From the [[Middle Ages]], the activities of maintenance and conservation were in the hands of a \u201ctechnical office\u201d, which was in charge of all such operations and oversaw the workers and their sites: the ''Opera'', or ''fabbriceria'' or ''procuratoria''. After the mid-19th century, the Palace seemed to be in such a state of decay that its very survival was in question; thus, in 1876 a major restoration plan was launched. The work involved the two facades and the capitals belonging to the ground-floor arcade and the upper loggia: 42 of these, which appeared to be in a specially dilapidated state, were removed and replaced by copies. The originals, some of which were masterpieces of Venetian sculpture of the 14th and 15th centuries, were placed, together with other sculptures from the facades, in an area specifically set aside for this purpose: the Museo dell\u2019Opera. After undergoing thorough and careful restoration works, they are now exhibited, on their original columns, in these 6 rooms of the museum, which are traversed by an ancient wall in great blocks of stone, a remnant of an earlier version of the Palace. The rooms also contain fragments of statues and important architectural and decorative works in stone from the facades of the Palace.\n\n=== Doge's apartments ===\nThe rooms in which the Doge lived were always located in this area of the palace, between the [[Rio della Canonica]] \u2013 the water entrance to the building \u2013 the present-day Golden Staircase and the apse of [[St. Mark\u2019s Basilica]]. The disastrous fire in this part of the building in 1483 made important reconstruction work necessary, with the Doge\u2019s apartments being completed by 1510. The core of these apartments forms a prestigious, though not particularly large, residence, given that the rooms nearest the Golden Staircase had a mixed private and public function. In the private apartments, the Doge could set aside the trappings of office to retire at the end of the day and dine with members of his family amidst furnishings that he had brought from his own house (and which, at his death, would be promptly removed to make way for the property of the new elected Doge).\n* The Scarlet Chamber possibly takes its name from the color of the robes worn by the Ducal advisors and counsellors for whom it was the antechamber. The carved ceiling, adorned with the armorial bearings of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], is part of the original d\u00e9cor, probably designed by [[Biagio d'Antonio|Biagio]] and [[Pietro da Faenza]]. Amongst the wall decoration, two frescoed lunettes are particular worthy of attention: one by [[Giuseppe Salviati]], the other by [[Titian]].\n* The \u201cScudo\u201d Room has this name from the [[coat-of-arms]] of the reigning Doge which was exhibited here while he granted audiences and received guests. The coat-of-arms currently on display is that of [[Ludovico Manin]], the Doge reigning when the Republic of St. Mark came to an end in 1797. This is the largest room in the Doge\u2019s apartments, and runs the entire width of this wing of the palace. The hall was used as a reception chamber and its decoration with large geographical maps was designed to underline the glorious tradition that was at the very basis of Venetian power. The two globes in the center of the hall date from the same period: one shows the sphere of heavens, the other the surface of Earth.\n* The Erizzo Room owes its name to Doge [[Francesco Erizzo]] (1631\u20131646) and is decorated in the same way as the preceding ones: a carved wood ceiling, with gilding against a light-blue background, and a Lombardy-school fireplace. From here, a small staircase leads up to a window that gave access to a roof garden.\n*The Stucchi or Pri\u00f9li Room has a double name due to both the [[stucco]] works that adorn the vault and lunettes, dating from the period of Doge [[Marino Grimani]] (1595\u20131605), and the presence of the armorial bearings of Doge [[Antonio Pri\u00f9li]] (1618\u20131623), which are to be seen on the fireplace, surmounted by allegorical figures. The stucco-works on the walls and ceiling were later commissioned by another Doge [[Pietro Grimani]] (1741\u20131752). Various paintings representing the life of Jesus Christ are present in this room, as well as a portrait of the French [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]] (perhaps by [[Tintoretto]]) due to his visit to the city in 1574 on his way from [[Poland]] to take up the French throne left vacant with the death of his brother [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]].\n* Directly linked to the Shield Hall, the Philosophers\u2019 Room takes its name from the twelve pictures of ancient philosophers which were set up here in the 18th century, to be later replaced with allegorical works and portraits of Doges. To the left, a small doorway leads to a narrow staircase, which enabled the Doge to pass rapidly from his own apartments to the halls on the upper floors, where the meetings of the Senate and the Great Council were held. Above the other side of this doorway there is an important fresco of ''[[St. Christopher]]'' by [[Titian]].\n* The Corner Room's name comes from the presence of various paintings depicting Doge [[Giovanni I Cornaro|Giovanni Corner]] (1625\u20131629). The fireplace, made out of [[Carrara marble]], is decorated with a frieze of winged angels on dolphins around a central figure of [[St. Mark\u2019s Lion]]. Like the following room, this served no specific function; set aside for the private use of the Doge.\n* The Equerries Room was the main access to the Doge\u2019s private apartments. The palace equerries were appointed for life by the Doge himself and had to be at his disposal at any time.\n\n=== Institutional chambers ===\n[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3336.jpg|thumbnail|Palazzo Ducale, Sala del Senato, Venice, Italy. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\n* The Square Atrium served as a waiting room, the antechamber to various halls. The decoration dates from the 16th century, during the reign of Doge [[Girolamo Priuli (1486\u20131567)]], who appears in [[Tintoretto]]'s ceiling painting with the symbols of his office, and accompanied by scenes of biblical stories and allegories of the four seasons, probably by [[Tintoretto]]'s workshop, [[Girolamo Bassano]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].\n* The Four Doors Room was the formal antechamber to the more important rooms in the palace, and the doors which give it its name are ornately framed in precious Eastern marbles; each is surmounted by an allegorical sculptural group that refers to the virtues which should inspire those who took on the government responsibilities. The present decoration is a work by [[Antonio da Ponte]] and design by [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Giovan Antonio Rusconi]]. Painted by [[Tintoretto]] from 1578 onwards, the frescoes of mythological subjects and of the cities and regions under Venetian dominion were designed to show a close link between Venice\u2019s foundation, its independence, and the historical mission of the Venetian aristocracy. Amongst the paintings on the walls, one that stands out is [[Titian]]'s portrait of Doge [[Antonio Grimani]] (1521\u20131523). On the easel stands a painting by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] portraying Venice receiving the gifts of the sea from Neptune.\n[[File:Giambattista Tiepolo - Venezia riceve l'omaggio di Nettuno - 1745-50.jpg|thumb|''Neptune Offering Gifts to Venice'' (1748\u20131750) by [[Giovan Battista Tiepolo]]]]\n* Antechamber to the Hall of the [[Full College]] was the formal antechamber where foreign ambassadors and delegations waited to be received by the Full College, delegated by the Senate to deal with foreign affairs. This room was restored after the 1574 fire and so was its decorations, with stucco-works and ceiling frescoes. The central fresco by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] shows Venice distributing honors and rewards. The top of the walls is decorated with a fine frieze and other sumptuous fittings, including the fireplace between the windows and the fine doorway leading into the Hall of the Full College, whose Corinthian columns bear a pediment surmounted by a marble sculpture showing the female figure of Venice resting on a lion and accompanied by allegories of Glory and Concord. Next to the doorways are four canvases that [[Tintoretto]] painted for the Square Atrium, but which were brought here in 1716 to replace the original leather wall panelling. Each of the mythological scenes depicted is also an allegory of the Republic\u2019s government.\n*The Council Chamber: the Full College was mainly responsible for organizing and coordinating the work of the [[Venetian Senate]], reading dispatches from ambassadors and city governors, receiving foreign delegations and promoting other political and legislative activity. Alongside these shared functions, each body had their own particular mandates, which made this body a sort of \u201cguiding intelligence\u201d behind the work of the Senate, especially in foreign affairs. The decorations were designed by [[Andrea Palladio]] to replace that destroyed in the 1574 fire; the wood panelling of the walls and end tribune and the carved ceiling are the work of [[Francesco Bello]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Andrea da Faenza|it}}. The paintings in the ceiling were commissioned from [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], who completed them between 1575 and 1578. This ceiling is one of the artist\u2019s masterpieces and celebrates the Good Government of the Republic, together with the Faith on which it rests and the Virtues that guide and strengthen it. Other paintings are by [[Tintoretto]] and show various Doges with the [[Christ]], the Virgin and saints.\n* The Senate Chamber was also known as the Sala dei Pregadi, because the Doge asked the members of the Senate to take part in the meetings held here. The Senate which met in this chamber was one of the oldest public institutions in Venice; it had first been founded in the 13th century and then gradually evolved over time, until by the 16th century it was the body mainly responsible for overseeing political and financial affairs in such areas as manufacturing industries, trade and foreign policy. In the works produced for this room by [[Tintoretto]], [[Christ]] is clearly the predominant figure; perhaps a reference to the Senate \u2018conclave\u2019 which elected the Doge, seen as being under the protection of the Son of God. The room also contains four paintings by [[Jacopo Palma il Giovane]], which are linked with specific events of the Venetian history.\n* The Chamber of the Council of Ten takes its name from the [[Council of Ten]] which was set up after a conspiracy in 1310, when [[Bajamonte Tiepolo]] and other noblemen tried to overthrow the institutions of the State. The ceiling decoration is a work by [[Gian Battista Ponchino]], with the assistance of a young [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Gian Battista Zelotti]]. Carved and gilded, the ceiling is divided into 25 compartments decorated with images of divinities and allegories intended to illustrate the power of the Council of Ten that was responsible for punishing the guilty and freeing the innocent.\n* The Compass Room is dedicated to the administration of justice; its name comes from the large wooden compass surmounted by a statue of Justice, which stands in one corner and hides the entrance to the rooms of the Three Heads of the Council of Ten and the State Inquisitors. This room was the antechamber where those who had been summoned by these powerful magistrates waited to be called and the decoration was intended to underline the solemnity of the Republic\u2019s legal machinery, dating from the 16th century. The ceiling paintings are by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and the large fireplace was designed by [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]]. From this room, one can pass to the Armoury and the New Prisons, on the other side of the [[Bridge of Sighs]], or go straight down the Censors\u2019 Staircase to pass into the rooms housing the councils of justice on the first floor.\n* In the [[Venetian language]], ''Liag\u00f2'' means a terrace or balcony enclosed by glass. This particular example was a sort of corridor and meeting-place for patrician members of the Great Council in the intervals between their discussions of government business.\n* The Chamber of Quarantia Civil Vecchia: originally a single 40-man-council which wielded substantial political and legislative power, the [[Quarantia]] was during the course of the 15th century divided into three separate councils. This room was restored in the 17th century; the fresco fragment to the right of the entrance is the only remnant of the original decorations.\n* The Guariento Room's name is due to the fact it houses a fresco painted by the Paduan artist [[Guariento]] around 1365. Almost completely destroyed in the 1577 fire, the remains of that fresco were, in 1903, rediscovered under the large canvas ''[[Il Paradiso]]'' which [[Tintoretto]] was commissioned to paint.\n* Restructured in the 14th century, the Chamber of the Great Council was decorated with a fresco by [[Guariento]] and later with works by the most famous artists of the period, including [[Gentile da Fabriano]], [[Pisanello]], [[Alvise Vivarini]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Pordenone]] and [[Titian]], along with a 1582 ceiling painting of ''The Triumph of Venice, Crowned by Victory'' by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. 53 meters long and 25 meters wide, this is not only the largest chamber in the Doge\u2019s Palace, but also one of the largest rooms in Europe. Here, meetings of the Great Council were held, the most important political body in the Republic. A very ancient institution, this Council was made up of all the male members of patrician Venetian families over 25 years old, irrespective of their individual status, merits or wealth. This was why, in spite of the restrictions in its powers that the Senate introduced over the centuries, the Great Council continued to be seen as bastion of Republican equality. Soon after work on the new hall had been completed, the 1577 fire damaged not only this Chamber but also the Scrutinio Room. The structural damage was soon restored, respecting the original layout, and all works were finished within few years, ending in 1579\u201380. The decoration of the restored structure involved artists such as [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Tintoretto|Jacopo]] and [[Domenico Tintoretto]], and [[Palma il Giovane|Jacopo Palma il Giovane]]. The walls were decorated with episodes of the Venetian history, with particular reference to the city\u2019s relations with the papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], while the ceiling was decorated with the Virtues and individual examples of Venetian heroism, and a central panel containing an allegorical glorification of the Republic. Facing each other in groups of six, the twelve wall paintings depict acts of valor or incidents of war that had occurred during the city\u2019s history. Immediately below the ceiling runs a frieze with portraits of the first 76 doges (the portraits of the others are to be found in the Scrutinio Room); commissioned from [[Tintoretto]], most of these paintings are in fact the work of his [[Domenico Tintoretto|son]]. Each Doge holds a scroll bearing a reference to his most important achievements, while Doge [[Marin Faliero]], who attempted a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' in 1355, is represented simply by a black cloth as a traitor to the Republic. One of the long walls, behind the Doge\u2019s throne, is occupied by the longest canvas painting in the world, ''[[Il Paradiso]]'', which Tintoretto and his workshop produced between 1588 and 1592.\n* The Scrutinio Room is in the wing built between the 1520s and 1540s during the dogate of [[Francesco Foscari]] (1423\u201357), facing the Piazzeta. It was initially intended to house the precious manuscripts left to the Republic by [[Petrarch]] and [[Bessarione]] (1468); indeed, it was originally known as the Library. In 1532, it was decided that the Chamber should also hold the electoral counting and/or deliberations that assiduously marked the rhythm of Venetian politics, based on an assembly system whose epicenter was the nearby Great Council Chamber. After the construction of [[Biblioteca Marciana]] though, this room was used solely for elections. The present decorations date from between 1578 and 1615, after the 1577 fire. Episodes of military history in the various compartments glorify the exploits of the Venetians, with particular emphasis on the conquest of the maritime empire; the only exception being the last oval, recording the taking of [[Padua]] in 1405.\n* The  Quarantia Criminale Chamber and the Cuoi Room were used for the administration of justice. The [[Council of Forty|Quarantia Criminal]] was set up in the 15th century and dealt with cases of criminal law. It was a very important body as its members also had legislative powers.\n* The Magistrato alle Leggi Chamber housed the [[Magistratura dei Conservatori]] ed esecutori delle leggi e ordini degli uffici di San Marco e di Rialto. Created in 1553, this authority was headed by three of the city\u2019s patricians and was responsible for making sure the regulations concerning the practice of law were observed.\n* The State Censors were set up in 1517 by Marco Giovanni di Giovanni, a cousin of Doge Andrea Gritti (1523\u20131538) and nephew of the great Francesco Foscari. The title and duties of the Censors resulted from the cultural and political upheavals that are associated with Humanism. In fact, the Censors were not judges as such, but more like moral consultants, their main task being the suppression of electoral fraud and protection of the State\u2019s public institutions. On the walls of the Censors' Chamber hang a number of [[Domenico Tintoretto]]'s portraits of these magistrates, and below the armorial bearings of some of those who held the position.\n* The State Advocacies' Chamber is decorated with paintings representing some of the [[Avogadori di Com\u00fan]] venerating the Virgin, the Christ and various saints. The three members, the Avogadori, were the figures who safeguarded the very principle of legality, making sure that the laws were applied correctly. They were also responsible for preserving the integrity of the city\u2019s patrician class, verifying the legitimacy of marriages and births inscribed in the Golden Book.\n* The \"Scrigno\" Room: the Venetian nobility as a caste came into existence because of the \u201cclosure\u201d of admissions to the Great Council in 1297; however, it was only in the 16th century that formal measures were taken to introduce restrictions that protected the status of that aristocracy: marriages between nobles and commoners were forbidden and greater controls were set up to check the validity of aristocratic titles. There was also a Silver Book, which registered all those families that not only had the requisites of \u201ccivilization\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d, but could also show that they were of ancient Venetian origin; such families furnished the manpower for the State bureaucracy - and particularly, the chancellery within the Doge\u2019s Palace itself. Both books were kept in a chest in this room, inside a cupboard that also contained all the documents proving the legitimacy of claims to be inscribed therein.\n* Chamber of the Navy Captains: made up of 20 members from the Senate and the Great Council, the [[Milizia da Mar]], first set up in the mid-16th century, was responsible for recruiting crews necessary for Venice\u2019s war galleys. Another similar body, entitled the [[Provveditori all\u2019Armar]], was responsible for the actual fitting and supplying of the fleet. The furnishings are from the 16th century, while the wall torches date from the 18th century.\n\n=== Old Prison or Piombi ===\nPrior to the 12th century there were holding cells within the Doge's Palace but during the 13th and fourteenth centuries more prison spaces were created to occupy the entire ground floor of the southern wing. \nAgain these layouts changed in c.1540 when a compound of the ground floor of the eastern wing was built.  Due to the dark, damp and isolated qualities of they came to be known as the Pozzi (the Wells).<ref>Geltner, G., 2008. The Medieval Prison: A Social History. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (pp.12)</ref>\nIn 1591 yet more cells were built in the upper eastern wing.  Due to their position, directly under the lead roof, they were known as [[Piombi]].<ref>Geltner, G., 2008. The Medieval Prison: A Social History. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (pp.12)</ref>  Among the famous inmates of the prison were [[Silvio Pellico]] and [[Giacomo Casanova]]. The latter in his biography describes escaping through the roof, re-entering the palace, and exiting through the [[Porta della Carta]].\n\n=== Bridge of Sighs and the New Prisons ===\n[[File:4775 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 12 - Falsa fides in me semper est - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 31-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|left|Capital #12 in the porch (counting as #0 the one at the corner near the [[Bridge of Sighs]]): \"Allegories of Virtues and Vices\" - \"Falsa fides in me semper est\".]]\n\nA corridor leads over the [[Bridge of Sighs]], built in 1614 to link the Doge\u2019s Palace to the structure intended to house the New Prisons.<ref>Geltner, G., 2008. The Medieval Prison: A Social History. Princeton: Princeton University Press (pp. 13)</ref> Enclosed and covered on all sides, the bridge contains two separate corridors that run next to each other. That which visitors use today linked the Prisons to the chambers of the Magistrato alle Leggi and the Quarantia Criminal; the other linked the prisons to the State Advocacy rooms and the Parlatorio. Both corridors are linked to the service staircase that leads from the ground floor cells of the Pozzi to the roof cells of the Piombi.\n\nThe famous name of the bridge dates from the [[Romantic period]] and was supposed to refer to the sighs of prisoners who, passing from the courtroom to the cell in which they would serve their sentence, took a last look at freedom as they glimpsed the lagoon and [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio]] through the small windows. In the mid-16th century it was decided to build a new structure on the other side of the canal to the side of the palace which would house prisons and the chambers of the magistrates known as the Notte al Criminal. Ultimately linked to the palace by the Bridge of Sighs, the building was intended to improve the conditions for prisoners with larger and more light-filled and airy cells. However, certain sections of the new prisons fall short of this aim, particularly those laid out with passageways on all sides and those cells which give onto the inner courtyard of the building. In keeping with previous traditions, each cell was lined with overlapping planks of larch that were nailed in place.\n\n[[File:Madonna col bambino, Palazzo Ducale, Venezia.jpg|thumb|right|''Madonna col bambino'', the painting stolen on 9 October 1991 by [[Vincenzo Pipino]] after he hid in a cell in the New Prisons]]\n\nThe only<!-- modern? --> art theft from the Doge's Palace was executed on 9 October 1991 by [[Vincenzo Pipino]], who hid in one of the cells in the New Prisons after lagging behind a tour group, then crossed the Bridge of Sighs in the middle of the night to the Sala di Censori. In that room was the ''Madonna col bambino'', a work symbolic of \"the power of the Venetian state\" painted in the early 1500s by a member of the [[Vivarini]] school.{{sfn|Davis|Wolman|2014}} By the next morning, it was in the possession of the [[Mala del Brenta]] organized crime group.

[[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic]] style, and one of the main landmarks of the city of [[Venice]] in northern [[Italy]]. The palace was the residence of the [[Doge of Venice]], the supreme authority of the former [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. It was founded in 1340, and extended and modified in the following centuries. It became a museum in 1923, and is one of the 11 museums run by the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:MZK 001 Nr 09 Eine Ansicht des Dogenpalastes - Fig. 01 Ende 14. Jhdt.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the Doge's Palace, late 14th century]]\nIn 810, Doge [[Agnello Participazio]] moved the seat of government from the island of [[Malamocco]] to the area of the present-day [[Rialto]], when it was decided a ''palatium duci'' ([[Latin]] for \"ducal palace\") should be built. However, no trace remains of that 9th-century  building as the palace was partially destroyed in the 10th century by a fire. The following reconstruction works were undertaken at the behest of Doge [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u20131178). A great reformer, he would drastically change the entire layout of the [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]]. The new palace was built out of fortresses, one fa\u00e7ade to the Piazzetta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. Although only few traces remain of that palace, some [[Byzantine-Venetian architecture]] characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in [[Istrian stone]] and some [[Herringbone pattern|herring-bone pattern]] brick paving.\n\nPolitical changes in the mid-13th century led to the need to re-think the palace's structure due to the considerable increase in the number of the Great Council's members. The new Gothic palace's constructions started around 1340, focusing mostly on the side of the building facing the lagoon. Only in 1424 did Doge [[Francesco Foscari]] decide to extend the rebuilding works to the wing overlooking the Piazzetta, serving as law-courts, and with a ground floor arcade on the outside, open first floor loggias running along the fa\u00e7ade, and the internal courtyard side of the wing, completed with the construction of the Porta della Carta (1442).\n\nIn 1483, a violent fire broke out in the side of the palace overlooking the canal, where the Doge's Apartments were. Once again, an important reconstruction became necessary and was commissioned from Antonio Rizzo, who would introduce the new [[Renaissance]] language to the building's architecture. An entire new structure was raised alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the [[Ponte della Paglia]], with the official rooms of the government decorated with works commissioned from [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giorgione]], [[Alvise Vivarini]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].\n\nAnother huge fire in 1547 destroyed some of the rooms on the second floor, but fortunately without undermining the structure as a whole. Refurbishment works were being held at the palace when on 1577 a third fire destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber, together with works by [[Gentile da Fabriano]], [[Pisanello]], [[Alvise Vivarini]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Pordenone]], and [[Titian]]. In the subsequent rebuilding work it was decided to respect the original [[Gothic style]], despite the submission of a neo-classical alternative designs by the influential [[Renaissance]] architect [[Andrea Palladio]]. However, there are some classical features \u2014 for example, since the 16th century, the palace has been linked to the prison by the [[Bridge of Sighs]].\n\nAs well as being the ducal residence, the palace housed political institutions of the Republic of Venice until the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|Napoleonic occupation of the city]] in 1797, when its role inevitably changed. Venice was subjected first to French rule, then to Austrian, and finally in 1866 [[Risorgimento|it became part]] of Italy. Over this period, the palace was occupied by various administrative offices as well as housing the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] and other important cultural institutions within the city.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the Italian State, owner of the building, entrusted the management to the Venetian municipality to be run as a museum. Since 1996, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which has been under the management of the [[Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia]] since 2008.\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Exterior ===\n[[File:Piazzetta San Marco Venice BLS.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Facing the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] on the Piazzetta San Marco, with Doge's Palace on the left.]]\n[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3325.jpg|thumbnail|Palazzo Ducale, south colonnade, Venice, Italy. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nThe oldest part of the palace is the wing overlooking the lagoon, the corners of which are decorated with 14th-century sculptures, thought to be by [[Filippo Calendario]] and various Lombard artists such as Matteo Raverti and [[Antonio Bregno]]. The ground floor arcade and the [[loggia]] above are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century capitals, some of which were replaced with copies during the 19th century.\n\nIn 1438\u20131442,  Giovanni Bon  and [[Bartolomeo Bon]] built and adorned the Porta della Carta, which served as the ceremonial entrance to the building. The name of the gateway probably derives either from the fact that this was the area where public scribes set up their desks, or from the nearby location of the ''cartabum'', the archives of state documents. Flanked by [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] pinnacles, with two figures of the ''Cardinal Virtues'' per side, the gateway is crowned by a bust of [[Mark the Evangelist]] over which rises a statue of ''Justice'' with her traditional symbols of sword and scales. In the space above the cornice, there is a sculptural portrait of the Doge [[Francesco Foscari]] kneeling before the [[Lion of Saint Mark]]. This is, however, a 19th-century work by [[Luigi Ferrari]], created to replace the original destroyed in 1797.\n\nToday, the public entrance to the Doge's Palace is via the Porta del Frumento, on the waterfront side of the building.\n\n=== Courtyard ===\n[[File:Doge's Palace Courtyard BLS.jpg|thumbnail|Courtyard of the Doge's Palace, facing the San Marco basilica.]]\n[[File:Doge's Palace Scala dei Giganti BLS.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Scala dei Giganti'', flanked by Mars and Neptune.]]\nThe north side of the courtyard is closed by the junction between the palace and [[St. Mark\u2019s Basilica]], which used to be the [[Doge]]\u2019s chapel. At the center of the courtyard stand two well-heads dating from the mid-16th century.\n\nIn 1485, the Great Council decided that a ceremonial staircase should be built within the courtyard. The design envisaged a straight axis with the rounded Foscari Arch, with alternate bands of [[Istrian stone]] and [[red Verona marble]], linking the staircase to the Porta della Carta, and thus producing one single monumental approach from the Piazza into the heart of the building. Since 1567, the Giants\u2019 Staircase is guarded by [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]]\u2019s two colossal statues of ''Mars'' and ''Neptune'', which represents Venice\u2019s power by land and by sea, and therefore the reason for its name. Members of the Senate gathered before government meetings in the Senator\u2019s Courtyard, to the right of the Giants\u2019 Staircase.\n\n=== Museo dell'Opera ===\nOver the centuries, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been restructured and restored countless times. Due to fires, structural failures, and infiltrations, and new organizational requirements and modifications or complete overhaulings of the ornamental trappings there was hardly a moment in which some kind of works have not been under way at the building. From the [[Middle Ages]], the activities of maintenance and conservation were in the hands of a \u201ctechnical office\u201d, which was in charge of all such operations and oversaw the workers and their sites: the ''Opera'', or ''fabbriceria'' or ''procuratoria''. After the mid-19th century, the Palace seemed to be in such a state of decay that its very survival was in question; thus, in 1876 a major restoration plan was launched. The work involved the two facades and the capitals belonging to the ground-floor arcade and the upper loggia: 42 of these, which appeared to be in a specially dilapidated state, were removed and replaced by copies. The originals, some of which were masterpieces of Venetian sculpture of the 14th and 15th centuries, were placed, together with other sculptures from the facades, in an area specifically set aside for this purpose: the Museo dell\u2019Opera. After undergoing thorough and careful restoration works, they are now exhibited, on their original columns, in these 6 rooms of the museum, which are traversed by an ancient wall in great blocks of stone, a remnant of an earlier version of the Palace. The rooms also contain fragments of statues and important architectural and decorative works in stone from the facades of the Palace.\n\n=== Doge's apartments ===\nThe rooms in which the Doge lived were always located in this area of the palace, between the [[Rio della Canonica]] \u2013 the water entrance to the building \u2013 the present-day Golden Staircase and the apse of [[St. Mark\u2019s Basilica]]. The disastrous fire in this part of the building in 1483 made important reconstruction work necessary, with the Doge\u2019s apartments being completed by 1510. The core of these apartments forms a prestigious, though not particularly large, residence, given that the rooms nearest the Golden Staircase had a mixed private and public function. In the private apartments, the Doge could set aside the trappings of office to retire at the end of the day and dine with members of his family amidst furnishings that he had brought from his own house (and which, at his death, would be promptly removed to make way for the property of the new elected Doge).\n* The Scarlet Chamber possibly takes its name from the color of the robes worn by the Ducal advisors and counsellors for whom it was the antechamber. The carved ceiling, adorned with the armorial bearings of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], is part of the original d\u00e9cor, probably designed by [[Biagio d'Antonio|Biagio]] and [[Pietro da Faenza]]. Amongst the wall decoration, two frescoed lunettes are particular worthy of attention: one by [[Giuseppe Salviati]], the other by [[Titian]].\n* The \u201cScudo\u201d Room has this name from the [[coat-of-arms]] of the reigning Doge which was exhibited here while he granted audiences and received guests. The coat-of-arms currently on display is that of [[Ludovico Manin]], the Doge reigning when the Republic of St. Mark came to an end in 1797. This is the largest room in the Doge\u2019s apartments, and runs the entire width of this wing of the palace. The hall was used as a reception chamber and its decoration with large geographical maps was designed to underline the glorious tradition that was at the very basis of Venetian power. The two globes in the center of the hall date from the same period: one shows the sphere of heavens, the other the surface of Earth.\n* The Erizzo Room owes its name to Doge [[Francesco Erizzo]] (1631\u20131646) and is decorated in the same way as the preceding ones: a carved wood ceiling, with gilding against a light-blue background, and a Lombardy-school fireplace. From here, a small staircase leads up to a window that gave access to a roof garden.\n*The Stucchi or Pri\u00f9li Room has a double name due to both the [[stucco]] works that adorn the vault and lunettes, dating from the period of Doge [[Marino Grimani]] (1595\u20131605), and the presence of the armorial bearings of Doge [[Antonio Pri\u00f9li]] (1618\u20131623), which are to be seen on the fireplace, surmounted by allegorical figures. The stucco-works on the walls and ceiling were later commissioned by another Doge [[Pietro Grimani]] (1741\u20131752). Various paintings representing the life of Jesus Christ are present in this room, as well as a portrait of the French [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]] (perhaps by [[Tintoretto]]) due to his visit to the city in 1574 on his way from [[Poland]] to take up the French throne left vacant with the death of his brother [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]].\n* Directly linked to the Shield Hall, the Philosophers\u2019 Room takes its name from the twelve pictures of ancient philosophers which were set up here in the 18th century, to be later replaced with allegorical works and portraits of Doges. To the left, a small doorway leads to a narrow staircase, which enabled the Doge to pass rapidly from his own apartments to the halls on the upper floors, where the meetings of the Senate and the Great Council were held. Above the other side of this doorway there is an important fresco of ''[[St. Christopher]]'' by [[Titian]].\n* The Corner Room's name comes from the presence of various paintings depicting Doge [[Giovanni I Cornaro|Giovanni Corner]] (1625\u20131629). The fireplace, made out of [[Carrara marble]], is decorated with a frieze of winged angels on dolphins around a central figure of [[St. Mark\u2019s Lion]]. Like the following room, this served no specific function; set aside for the private use of the Doge.\n* The Equerries Room was the main access to the Doge\u2019s private apartments. The palace equerries were appointed for life by the Doge himself and had to be at his disposal at any time.\n\n=== Institutional chambers ===\n[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3336.jpg|thumbnail|Palazzo Ducale, Sala del Senato, Venice, Italy. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\n* The Square Atrium served as a waiting room, the antechamber to various halls. The decoration dates from the 16th century, during the reign of Doge [[Girolamo Priuli (1486\u20131567)]], who appears in [[Tintoretto]]\u2019s ceiling painting with the symbols of his office, and accompanied by scenes of biblical stories and allegories of the four seasons, probably by [[Tintoretto]]\u2019s workshop, [[Girolamo Bassano]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].\n* The Four Doors Room was the formal antechamber to the more important rooms in the palace, and the doors which give it its name are ornately framed in precious Eastern marbles; each is surmounted by an allegorical sculptural group that refers to the virtues which should inspire those who took on the government responsibilities. The present decoration is a work by [[Antonio da Ponte]] and design by [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Giovan Antonio Rusconi]]. Painted by [[Tintoretto]] from 1578 onwards, the frescoes of mythological subjects and of the cities and regions under Venetian dominion were designed to show a close link between Venice\u2019s foundation, its independence, and the historical mission of the Venetian aristocracy. Amongst the paintings on the walls, one that stands out is [[Titian]]\u2019s portrait of Doge [[Antonio Grimani]] (1521\u20131523). On the easel stands a painting by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] portraying Venice receiving the gifts of the sea from Neptune.\n[[File:Giambattista Tiepolo - Venezia riceve l'omaggio di Nettuno - 1745-50.jpg|thumb|''Neptune Offering Gifts to Venice'' (1748\u20131750) by [[Giovan Battista Tiepolo]]]]\n* Antechamber to the Hall of the [[Full College]] was the formal antechamber where foreign ambassadors and delegations waited to be received by the Full College, delegated by the Senate to deal with foreign affairs. This room was restored after the 1574 fire and so was its decorations, with stucco-works and ceiling frescoes. The central fresco by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] shows Venice distributing honors and rewards. The top of the walls is decorated with a fine frieze and other sumptuous fittings, including the fireplace between the windows and the fine doorway leading into the Hall of the Full College, whose Corinthian columns bear a pediment surmounted by a marble sculpture showing the female figure of Venice resting on a lion and accompanied by allegories of Glory and Concord. Next to the doorways are four canvases that [[Tintoretto]] painted for the Square Atrium, but which were brought here in 1716 to replace the original leather wall panelling. Each of the mythological scenes depicted is also an allegory of the Republic\u2019s government.\n*The Council Chamber: the Full College was mainly responsible for organizing and coordinating the work of the [[Venetian Senate]], reading dispatches from ambassadors and city governors, receiving foreign delegations and promoting other political and legislative activity. Alongside these shared functions, each body had their own particular mandates, which made this body a sort of \u201cguiding intelligence\u201d behind the work of the Senate, especially in foreign affairs. The decorations were designed by [[Andrea Palladio]] to replace that destroyed in the 1574 fire; the wood panelling of the walls and end tribune and the carved ceiling are the work of [[Francesco Bello]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Andrea da Faenza|it}}. The paintings in the ceiling were commissioned from [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], who completed them between 1575 and 1578. This ceiling is one of the artist\u2019s masterpieces and celebrates the Good Government of the Republic, together with the Faith on which it rests and the Virtues that guide and strengthen it. Other paintings are by [[Tintoretto]] and show various Doges with the [[Christ]], the Virgin and saints.\n* The Senate Chamber was also known as the Sala dei Pregadi, because the Doge asked the members of the Senate to take part in the meetings held here. The Senate which met in this chamber was one of the oldest public institutions in Venice; it had first been founded in the 13th century and then gradually evolved over time, until by the 16th century it was the body mainly responsible for overseeing political and financial affairs in such areas as manufacturing industries, trade and foreign policy. In the works produced for this room by [[Tintoretto]], [[Christ]] is clearly the predominant figure; perhaps a reference to the Senate \u2018conclave\u2019 which elected the Doge, seen as being under the protection of the Son of God. The room also contains four paintings by [[Jacopo Palma il Giovane]], which are linked with specific events of the Venetian history.\n* The Chamber of the Council of Ten takes its name from the [[Council of Ten]] which was set up after a conspiracy in 1310, when [[Bajamonte Tiepolo]] and other noblemen tried to overthrow the institutions of the State. The ceiling decoration is a work by [[Gian Battista Ponchino]], with the assistance of a young [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Gian Battista Zelotti]]. Carved and gilded, the ceiling is divided into 25 compartments decorated with images of divinities and allegories intended to illustrate the power of the Council of Ten that was responsible for punishing the guilty and freeing the innocent.\n* The Compass Room is dedicated to the administration of justice; its name comes from the large wooden compass surmounted by a statue of Justice, which stands in one corner and hides the entrance to the rooms of the Three Heads of the Council of Ten and the State Inquisitors. This room was the antechamber where those who had been summoned by these powerful magistrates waited to be called and the decoration was intended to underline the solemnity of the Republic\u2019s legal machinery, dating from the 16th century. The ceiling paintings are by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and the large fireplace was designed by [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]]. From this room, one can pass to the Armoury and the New Prisons, on the other side of the [[Bridge of Sighs]], or go straight down the Censors\u2019 Staircase to pass into the rooms housing the councils of justice on the first floor.\n* In the [[Venetian language]], ''Liag\u00f2'' means a terrace or balcony enclosed by glass. This particular example was a sort of corridor and meeting-place for patrician members of the Great Council in the intervals between their discussions of government business.\n* The Chamber of Quarantia Civil Vecchia: originally a single 40-man-council which wielded substantial political and legislative power, the [[Quarantia]] was during the course of the 15th century divided into three separate councils. This room was restored in the 17th century; the fresco fragment to the right of the entrance is the only remnant of the original decorations.\n* The Guariento Room's name is due to the fact it houses a fresco painted by the Paduan artist [[Guariento]] around 1365. Almost completely destroyed in the 1577 fire, the remains of that fresco were, in 1903, rediscovered under the large canvas ''[[Il Paradiso]]'' which [[Tintoretto]] was commissioned to paint.\n* Restructured in the 14th century, the Chamber of the Great Council was decorated with a fresco by [[Guariento]] and later with works by the most famous artists of the period, including [[Gentile da Fabriano]], [[Pisanello]], [[Alvise Vivarini]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Pordenone]] and [[Titian]], along with a 1582 ceiling painting of ''The Triumph of Venice, Crowned by Victory'' by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. 53 meters long and 25 meters wide, this is not only the largest chamber in the Doge\u2019s Palace, but also one of the largest rooms in Europe. Here, meetings of the Great Council were held, the most important political body in the Republic. A very ancient institution, this Council was made up of all the male members of patrician Venetian families over 25 years old, irrespective of their individual status, merits or wealth. This was why, in spite of the restrictions in its powers that the Senate introduced over the centuries, the Great Council continued to be seen as bastion of Republican equality. Soon after work on the new hall had been completed, the 1577 fire damaged not only this Chamber but also the Scrutinio Room. The structural damage was soon restored, respecting the original layout, and all works were finished within few years, ending in 1579\u201380. The decoration of the restored structure involved artists such as [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Tintoretto|Jacopo]] and [[Domenico Tintoretto]], and [[Palma il Giovane|Jacopo Palma il Giovane]]. The walls were decorated with episodes of the Venetian history, with particular reference to the city\u2019s relations with the papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], while the ceiling was decorated with the Virtues and individual examples of Venetian heroism, and a central panel containing an allegorical glorification of the Republic. Facing each other in groups of six, the twelve wall paintings depict acts of valor or incidents of war that had occurred during the city\u2019s history. Immediately below the ceiling runs a frieze with portraits of the first 76 doges (the portraits of the others are to be found in the Scrutinio Room); commissioned from [[Tintoretto]], most of these paintings are in fact the work of his [[Domenico Tintoretto|son]]. Each Doge holds a scroll bearing a reference to his most important achievements, while Doge [[Marin Faliero]], who attempted a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' in 1355, is represented simply by a black cloth as a traitor to the Republic. One of the long walls, behind the Doge\u2019s throne, is occupied by the longest canvas painting in the world, ''[[Il Paradiso]]'', which Tintoretto and his workshop produced between 1588 and 1592.\n* The Scrutinio Room is in the wing built between the 1520s and 1540s during the dogate of [[Francesco Foscari]] (1423\u201357), facing the Piazzeta. It was initially intended to house the precious manuscripts left to the Republic by [[Petrarch]] and [[Bessarione]] (1468); indeed, it was originally known as the Library. In 1532, it was decided that the Chamber should also hold the electoral counting and/or deliberations that assiduously marked the rhythm of Venetian politics, based on an assembly system whose epicenter was the nearby Great Council Chamber. After the construction of [[Biblioteca Marciana]] though, this room was used solely for elections. The present decorations date from between 1578 and 1615, after the 1577 fire. Episodes of military history in the various compartments glorify the exploits of the Venetians, with particular emphasis on the conquest of the maritime empire; the only exception being the last oval, recording the taking of [[Padua]] in 1405.\n* The  Quarantia Criminale Chamber and the Cuoi Room were used for the administration of justice. The [[Council of Forty|Quarantia Criminal]] was set up in the 15th century and dealt with cases of criminal law. It was a very important body as its members also had legislative powers.\n* The Magistrato alle Leggi Chamber housed the [[Magistratura dei Conservatori]] ed esecutori delle leggi e ordini degli uffici di San Marco e di Rialto. Created in 1553, this authority was headed by three of the city\u2019s patricians and was responsible for making sure the regulations concerning the practice of law were observed.\n* The State Censors were set up in 1517 by Marco Giovanni di Giovanni, a cousin of Doge Andrea Gritti (1523\u20131538) and nephew of the great Francesco Foscari. The title and duties of the Censors resulted from the cultural and political upheavals that are associated with Humanism. In fact, the Censors were not judges as such, but more like moral consultants, their main task being the suppression of electoral fraud and protection of the State\u2019s public institutions. On the walls of the Censors' Chamber hang a number of [[Domenico Tintoretto]]\u2019s portraits of these magistrates, and below the armorial bearings of some of those who held the position.\n* The State Advocacies' Chamber is decorated with paintings representing some of the [[Avogadori di Com\u00fan]] venerating the Virgin, the Christ and various saints. The three members, the Avogadori, were the figures who safeguarded the very principle of legality, making sure that the laws were applied correctly. They were also responsible for preserving the integrity of the city\u2019s patrician class, verifying the legitimacy of marriages and births inscribed in the Golden Book.\n* The \"Scrigno\" Room: the Venetian nobility as a caste came into existence because of the \u201cclosure\u201d of admissions to the Great Council in 1297; however, it was only in the 16th century that formal measures were taken to introduce restrictions that protected the status of that aristocracy: marriages between nobles and commoners were forbidden and greater controls were set up to check the validity of aristocratic titles. There was also a Silver Book, which registered all those families that not only had the requisites of \u201ccivilization\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d, but could also show that they were of ancient Venetian origin; such families furnished the manpower for the State bureaucracy - and particularly, the chancellery within the Doge\u2019s Palace itself. Both books were kept in a chest in this room, inside a cupboard that also contained all the documents proving the legitimacy of claims to be inscribed therein.\n* Chamber of the Navy Captains: made up of 20 members from the Senate and the Great Council, the [[Milizia da Mar]], first set up in the mid-16th century, was responsible for recruiting crews necessary for Venice\u2019s war galleys. Another similar body, entitled the [[Provveditori all\u2019Armar]], was responsible for the actual fitting and supplying of the fleet. The furnishings are from the 16th century, while the wall torches date from the 18th century.\n\n=== Old Prison or Piombi ===\nPrior to the 12th century there were holding cells within the Doge's Palace but during the 13th and fourteenth centuries more prison spaces were created to occupy the entire ground floor of the southern wing. \nAgain these layouts changed in c.1540 when a compound of the ground floor of the eastern wing was built.  Due to the dark, damp and isolated qualities of they came to be known as the Pozzi (the Wells).<ref>Geltner, G., 2008. The Medieval Prison: A Social History. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (pp.12)</ref>\nIn 1591 yet more cells were built in the upper eastern wing.  Due to their position, directly under the lead roof, they were known as [[Piombi]].<ref>Geltner, G., 2008. The Medieval Prison: A Social History. Princeton: Princeton University Press. (pp.12)</ref>  Among the famous inmates of the prison were [[Silvio Pellico]] and [[Giacomo Casanova]]. The latter in his biography describes escaping through the roof, re-entering the palace, and exiting through the [[Porta della Carta]].\n\n=== Bridge of Sighs and the New Prisons ===\n[[File:4775 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 12 - Falsa fides in me semper est - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 31-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|left|Capital #12 in the porch (counting as #0 the one at the corner near the [[Bridge of Sighs]]): \"Allegories of Virtues and Vices\" - \"Falsa fides in me semper est\".]]\n\nA corridor leads over the [[Bridge of Sighs]], built in 1614 to link the Doge\u2019s Palace to the structure intended to house the New Prisons.<ref>Geltner, G., 2008. The Medieval Prison: A Social History. Princeton: Princeton University Press (pp. 13)</ref> Enclosed and covered on all sides, the bridge contains two separate corridors that run next to each other. That which visitors use today linked the Prisons to the chambers of the Magistrato alle Leggi and the Quarantia Criminal; the other linked the prisons to the State Advocacy rooms and the Parlatorio. Both corridors are linked to the service staircase that leads from the ground floor cells of the Pozzi to the roof cells of the Piombi.\n\nThe famous name of the bridge dates from the [[Romantic period]] and was supposed to refer to the sighs of prisoners who, passing from the courtroom to the cell in which they would serve their sentence, took a last look at freedom as they glimpsed the lagoon and [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio]] through the small windows. In the mid-16th century it was decided to build a new structure on the other side of the canal to the side of the palace which would house prisons and the chambers of the magistrates known as the Notte al Criminal. Ultimately linked to the palace by the Bridge of Sighs, the building was intended to improve the conditions for prisoners with larger and more light-filled and airy cells. However, certain sections of the new prisons fall short of this aim, particularly those laid out with passageways on all sides and those cells which give onto the inner courtyard of the building. In keeping with previous traditions, each cell was lined with overlapping planks of larch that were nailed in place.\n\n[[File:Madonna col bambino, Palazzo Ducale, Venezia.jpg|thumb|right|''Madonna col bambino'', the painting stolen on 9 October 1991 by [[Vincenzo Pipino]] after he hid in a cell in the New Prisons]]\n\nThe only<!-- modern? --> art theft from the Doge's Palace was executed on 9 October 1991 by [[Vincenzo Pipino]], who hid in one of the cells in the New Prisons after lagging behind a tour group, then crossed the Bridge of Sighs in the middle of the night to the Sala di Censori.
