[[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Lyndsey Marshal]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Thierry Neuvic]] have supporting roles.\n\nMorgan sold the script [[Spec script|on spec]] to [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 2008, but it transferred to [[Warner Bros.]] by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in [[London]], [[San Francisco]], [[Paris]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\n''Hereafter'' premiered as a \"Special Presentation\" at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2010. The film was given a [[limited release]] on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story.\n\n==Plot==\nOn assignment in [[India]], French television journalist Marie Lelay is caught in the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated but left for dead. She gasps back to life after a [[near death experience]], glimpsing a vision of the [[afterlife]]. Marie is reunited with her lover Didier as the disaster subsides, and they return to [[Paris]]. Marie's experience interferes with her work, and Didier, also her producer, sends her on a leave of absence.\n\nIn [[San Francisco]], George Lonegan reluctantly agrees to perform a [[psychic reading]] for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. A genuine [[Mediumship|medium]], George abandoned his career as a psychic due to the emotional, often disturbing impact of communicating with the dead. George asks if \u201cJune\u201d means anything, which Christos denies; he reveals to Billy that June was his late wife's nurse, with whom he was in love.\n\nIn London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try to prevent their alcoholic, [[heroin]]-addicted mother Jackie from losing them to [[social services]]. Evading the authorities, Jackie sends Jason to the [[chemist]] to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. Escaping from street thugs, Jason is hit by a van and killed. Unable to protect his mother or cope without his brother, Marcus is sent to a foster home.\n\nMarie travels to [[Switzerland]] to meet a [[hospice]] director, a former skeptic now convinced the afterlife exists. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience, in hopes the scientific community will accept the reality of life beyond death.\n\nDesperate for a reunion with his brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and seeks help to contact Jason, but only encounters frauds. Boarding the [[London underground]] at [[Charing Cross]], Jason's cap blows off Marcus\u2019 head. Desperate to find it, Marcus misses his train, which explodes during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].\n\nAt a cooking class, George is partnered with Melanie. Hitting it off, they prepare dinner at George's home, and a phone message from Billy forces George to reveal his past as a psychic. Melanie persuades George to contact the spirit of her father, who asks forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees in tears, and does not return to the cooking class.\n\nHaving been in talks with a publisher about a biography of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Marie stuns them with her new manuscript: \"''Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence''\". The publisher rejects the work, but steers her toward another publisher in London. Marie learns Didier does not intend for her to return to her job, as her public interest in the hereafter has damaged her reputation, and he is having an affair with her replacement.\n\nLaid off from his factory job, George is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Changing his mind, he impulsively travels to London, obsessively listening to [[Derek Jacobi]]\u2019s audiobooks of [[Charles Dickens]]' works. He visits the [[Charles Dickens Museum]] and attends Jacobi's live reading at the [[London Book Fair]], where Marie is reading her now published book, ''Hereafter''. When she hands George a signed copy, he has a psychic flash of her near-drowning.\n\nAt the event with his foster parents, Marcus spots George, whom he has read about online. George brushes him off and returns to his hotel, but Marcus stands outside until George agrees to perform a reading. Through George, Jason tells Marcus he is happy in the afterlife, and that he knocked off his cap to save Marcus at the train station, and not to fear being alone \"because we are one\". With this closure, Marcus visits his mother, who is improving in a rehab center.\n\nGeorge leaves an anonymous note for Marie that he believes her book to be true. She decides to join him for lunch; arriving at the caf\u00e9, George sees a vision of them kissing. With their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them better appreciate life, George and Marie sit together.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference.jpg|thumb|300px|NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as George Lonegan, an American factory worker and \"a reluctant [[psychic]] [...] who can speak to the dead but prefers not to\".<ref name=RH>Random House (undated). \"[http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic/the-london-book-fair-to-star-in-clint-eastwoods-next-film-hereafter The London Book Fair to Star in Clint Eastwood's Next Film, Hereafter]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\".

The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar ways{{mdash}}all three have issues of communicating with the dead; [[Matt Damon]] plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; [[C\u00e9cile de France]] plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a [[near-death experience]] during the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]; and British twins Marcus and Jason (played by [[Frankie and George McLaren]]). [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Lyndsey Marshal]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Thierry Neuvic]] have supporting roles.\n\nMorgan sold the script [[Spec script|on spec]] to [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 2008, but it transferred to [[Warner Bros.]] by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in [[London]], [[San Francisco]], [[Paris]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\n''Hereafter'' premiered as a \"Special Presentation\" at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2010. The film was given a [[limited release]] on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story.\n\n==Plot==\nOn assignment in [[India]], French television journalist Marie Lelay is caught in the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated but left for dead. She gasps back to life after a [[near death experience]], glimpsing a vision of the [[afterlife]]. Marie is reunited with her lover Didier as the disaster subsides, and they return to [[Paris]]. Marie's experience interferes with her work, and Didier, also her producer, sends her on a leave of absence.\n\nIn [[San Francisco]], George Lonegan reluctantly agrees to perform a [[psychic reading]] for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. A genuine [[Mediumship|medium]], George abandoned his career as a psychic due to the emotional, often disturbing impact of communicating with the dead. George asks if \u201cJune\u201d means anything, which Christos denies; he reveals to Billy that June was his late wife's nurse, with whom he was in love.\n\nIn London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try to prevent their alcoholic, [[heroin]]-addicted mother Jackie from losing them to [[social services]]. Evading the authorities, Jackie sends Jason to the [[chemist]] to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. Escaping from street thugs, Jason is hit by a van and killed. Unable to protect his mother or cope without his brother, Marcus is sent to a foster home.\n\nMarie travels to [[Switzerland]] to meet a [[hospice]] director, a former skeptic now convinced the afterlife exists. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience, in hopes the scientific community will accept the reality of life beyond death.\n\nDesperate for a reunion with his brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and seeks help to contact Jason, but only encounters frauds. Boarding the [[London underground]] at [[Charing Cross]], Jason's cap blows off Marcus\u2019 head. Desperate to find it, Marcus misses his train, which explodes during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].\n\nAt a cooking class, George is partnered with Melanie. Hitting it off, they prepare dinner at George's home, and a phone message from Billy forces George to reveal his past as a psychic. Melanie persuades George to contact the spirit of her father, who asks forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees in tears, and does not return to the cooking class.\n\nHaving been in talks with a publisher about a biography of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Marie stuns them with her new manuscript: \"''Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence''\". The publisher rejects the work, but steers her toward another publisher in London. Marie learns Didier does not intend for her to return to her job, as her public interest in the hereafter has damaged her reputation, and he is having an affair with her replacement.\n\nLaid off from his factory job, George is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Changing his mind, he impulsively travels to London, obsessively listening to [[Derek Jacobi]]\u2019s audiobooks of [[Charles Dickens]]' works. He visits the [[Charles Dickens Museum]] and attends Jacobi's live reading at the [[London Book Fair]], where Marie is reading her now published book, ''Hereafter''. When she hands George a signed copy, he has a psychic flash of her near-drowning.\n\nAt the event with his foster parents, Marcus spots George, whom he has read about online. George brushes him off and returns to his hotel, but Marcus stands outside until George agrees to perform a reading. Through George, Jason tells Marcus he is happy in the afterlife, and that he knocked off his cap to save Marcus at the train station, and not to fear being alone \"because we are one\". With this closure, Marcus visits his mother, who is improving in a rehab center.\n\nGeorge leaves an anonymous note for Marie that he believes her book to be true. She decides to join him for lunch; arriving at the caf\u00e9, George sees a vision of them kissing. With their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them better appreciate life, George and Marie sit together.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference.jpg|thumb|300px|NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as George Lonegan, an American factory worker and \"a reluctant [[psychic]] [...] who can speak to the dead but prefers not to\".<ref name=RH>Random House (undated). \"[http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic/the-london-book-fair-to-star-in-clint-eastwoods-next-film-hereafter The London Book Fair to Star in Clint Eastwood's Next Film, Hereafter]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\".

This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]], giving rise to the [[expansionism|expansionist]] philosophy known as \"[[Manifest Destiny]]\".\n\nA \"[[frontier]]\" is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement. Leading theorist [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] went deeper, arguing that the frontier was the defining process of American civilization: \"The frontier,\" he asserted, \"promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people.\" He theorized it was a process of development: \"This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward...furnish[es] the forces dominating American character.\"<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History, in Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) pp. 1\u201338. [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/afp/turner.htm online]</ref> Turner's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians (and critics) to explore multiple individual American frontiers, but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Texas]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\nIn 19th- and early 20th-century media, enormous popular attention was focused on the [[Western United States]] in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, from the 1850s to the 1910s, a period sometimes called the '''Old West''' or the '''Wild West'''. Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect. This eventually inspired the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre of film, which spilled over into [[television show]]s, [[Western fiction|novels]], [[comic books]], and [[video game]]s, as well as children's toys and costumes.\n\nAs defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states.\" They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Robert V. | last=Hine | author2=John Mack Faragher | title=The American West: A New Interpretive History | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | year=2000 | page=[https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 10] | isbn=978-0300078350 | url=https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 }}</ref>  Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans: \"The existence of an area of\nfree land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.\"<ref>Quoted in William Cronon,  \"Revisiting the vanishing frontier: The legacy of Frederick Jackson Turner.\" ''Western Historical Quarterly'' 18.2 (1987): 157\u2013176, at p. 157.</ref> Through treaties with foreign nations and [[Native Americans in the United States|native tribes]], political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, the building of farms, ranches, and towns, the marking of trails and digging of mines, and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Turner, in his \"[[Frontier Thesis]]\" (1893), theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as [[individualism]], self-reliance, and even violence.\n\nAs the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took a firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike.

The American frontier began when [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia, was settled by the English in 1607. In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic coast, until about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier'' (5th ed. 2001) ch.&nbsp;1\u20137</ref> English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these [[habitants]] settled in villages along the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and midwest region they seldom settled down.

These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture, and as a result, by the 1760s these societies were highly egalitarian, as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main:\n{{quote|The typical frontier society, therefore, was one in which class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and there were a number of landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.<ref>Jackson Turner Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;11.</ref>}}\n\nIn the South, frontier areas that lacked transportation, such as the Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However, frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought up the good land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer \"frontier\". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid.

He identified these layers as multiple \"frontiers\" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.<ref>Mark Wyman, '' The Wisconsin Frontier'' (2009) pp.&nbsp;182, 293\u201394</ref>\n\nFrederick Jackson Turner grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant.\"<ref>Merle Curti, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959) p.&nbsp;1</ref> Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.<ref>Wyman, ''The Wisconsin Frontier'', p.&nbsp;293</ref>\n\n=== Southwest ===\n{{See also|Old Southwest}}\n[[File:Map of Santa Fe Trail-NPS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the [[Santa Fe Trail]]]]\nFrom the 1770s to the 1830s, pioneers moved into the new lands that stretched from Kentucky to Alabama to Texas. Most were farmers who moved in family groups.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' (5th ed. 1982) pp.&nbsp;203\u2013328, 747\u201366</ref>\n\nHistorian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was; they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up, they sold out and moved west to try again. Hacker describes that in Kentucky about 1812:\n\n{{quote|Farms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, possessing log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, enclosed in fences, and having plenty of standing timber for fuel. The land was sown in wheat and corn, which were the staples, while hemp [for making rope] was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms....\n\nYet, on the whole, it was an agricultural society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1892931|title = Western Land Hunger and the War of 1812: A Conjecture|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 365\u2013395|last1 = Hacker|first1 = Louis Morton|year = 1924|doi = 10.2307/1892931}}</ref>}}\nHacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land, repaired the damage, and practiced a more sustainable agriculture. Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] explored the individualistic worldview and values of the first generation:\n\n{{quote|What they objected to was arbitrary obstacles, artificial limitations upon the freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his own career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve pre\u00ebminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) p.&nbsp;342.</ref>}}\n\n=== Manifest Destiny ===\n{{Main|Manifest Destiny}}\n[[File:United States 1834-1836-03.png|thumb|upright=1.6|United States territories in 1834\u201336]]\nManifest Destiny was the belief that the United States was preordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. The concept was expressed during Colonial times, but the term was coined in the 1840s by a popular magazine which editorialized, \"the fulfillment of our manifest destiny...to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" As the nation grew, \"Manifest Destiny\" became a rallying cry for expansionists in the Democratic Party. In the 1840s the Tyler and Polk administrations (1841\u201349) successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine. However the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which represented business and financial interests, stood opposed to Manifest Destiny.

Tensions rose, however, after an abortive attempt to establish the independent nation of [[Fredonian Rebellion|Fredonia]] in 1826. [[William Travis]], leading the \"war party\", advocated for independence from Mexico, while the \"peace party\" led by Austin attempted to get more autonomy within the current relationship. When Mexican president [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] shifted alliances and joined the conservative Centralist party, he declared himself dictator and ordered soldiers into Texas to curtail new immigration and unrest. However, immigration continued and 30,000 Anglos with 3,000 slaves were settled in Texas by 1835.<ref>Quintard Taylor, \"Texas: The South Meets the West, The View Through African American History\", ''Journal of the West'' (2005) 44#2 pp.&nbsp;44\u201352</ref> In 1836, the [[Texas Revolution]] erupted.

The U.S. Congress declined to annex Texas, stalemated by contentious arguments over slavery and regional power. Thus, the [[Republic of Texas]] remained an independent power for nearly a decade before it was annexed as the 28th state in 1845.

A few hundred foreigners were scattered in the northern districts, including some Americans. With the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846 the U.S. sent in Fr\u00e9mont and a [[U.S. Army]] unit, as well as naval forces, and quickly took control.<ref>Kevin Starr, ''California: A History'' (2007) pp.&nbsp;43\u201370</ref> As the war was ending, gold was discovered in the north, and the word soon spread worldwide.\n\nThousands of \"Forty-Niners\" reached California, by sailing around South America (or taking a short-cut through disease-ridden Panama), or walked the California trail. The population soared to over 200,000 in 1852, mostly in the gold districts that stretched into the mountains east of San Francisco.\n\nHousing in San Francisco was at a premium, and abandoned ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging. In the gold fields themselves living conditions were primitive, though the mild climate proved attractive. Supplies were expensive and food poor, typical diets consisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. These highly male, transient communities with no established institutions were prone to high levels of violence, drunkenness, profanity, and greed-driven behavior. Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their own ad hoc legal system, based on the \"mining codes\" used in other mining communities abroad. Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote, sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantis; with Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon Morris Bakken|title=Law in the western United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjHQWyttp6QC&pg=PA209|year=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=209\u201314|isbn=9780806132150}}</ref>\n\nThe gold rush radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals, including precious metal specialists, merchants, doctors, and attorneys, who added to the population of miners, saloon keepers, gamblers, and prostitutes.

In a few years, nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, at the end of the '49 gold rush, through 1883, [[hydraulic mining]] was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. Hydraulic mining ended when public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.<ref>Walter Nugent, ''American West Chronicle'' (2007) p 119.</ref>\n\nThe mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to [[Dakota Territory|South Dakota]] contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites, where prospectors discovered gold, silver, copper and other minerals (as well as some soft-rock coal). Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight; most became [[ghost towns]] when the ores were depleted. Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest.

They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the [[Oregon Trail]]. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1979).</ref>\n\nIn the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", some 700 to 1,000 emigrants headed for Oregon; missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] led the wagons on the last leg. In 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about 2,000 miles (3,200&nbsp;km).<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1993)</ref> Though the main direction of travel on the early wagon trails was westward, people also used the Oregon Trail to travel eastward. Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated. Some returned with bags of gold and silver. Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west.

California unanimously rejected slavery in 1850 and became a free state. New Mexico allowed slavery, but it was rarely seen there. Kansas was off limits to slavery by the Compromise of 1820. Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms. Few Southern planters were actually interested in Kansas, but the idea that slavery was illegal there implied they had a second-class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor, and seemed to violate the principle of [[state's rights]]. With the passage of the extremely controversial [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery: [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called \"Jayhawkers\" or \"Free-soilers\") financed the migration of politically determined settlers.

Throughout the 19th century, Army officers typically served built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement.

Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], slaughtered 300 to 400 white settlers. The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops. The ensuing battles at [[Battle of Fort Ridgely|Fort Ridgely]], [[Battle of Birch Coulee|Birch Coulee]], [[Fort Abercrombie]], and [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]] punctuated a six-week war, which ended in American victory.

The result by 1890 was millions of new farms in the Plains states, many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia.\n\n== The Postbellum West ==\n\n=== Territorial governance after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Fsstockade.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] Stockade, February 1869]]\n\nWith the war over and slavery abolished, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much \"red tape\", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.<ref>Jack Ericson Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires: Governors and Territorial Government, 1784\u20131912'' (U. of Pittsburgh Press 1968)</ref>\n\nFederal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.<ref>Richard White (1991), p.&nbsp;177</ref>\n\nTerritorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.<ref>Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires'' p.&nbsp;190</ref>\n\nThese improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering.

Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaty, land title would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10&nbsp;km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at [[public auction]]. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.<ref>Richard White (1991), ch 6</ref>\n\nAs part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of \"land script\". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vernon Webster Johnson|author2=Raleigh Barlowe|title=Land Problems and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoHUQQFXzKAC&pg=PA40|year=1979|publisher=Ayer Publishing|page=40|isbn=9780405113789}}</ref> Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious.

The [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]] granted {{convert|160|acre|km2}} free to each settler who improved the land for five years; citizens and non-citizens including squatters and women, were all eligible. The only cost was a modest filing fee. The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states. Many took free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates.<ref>Harold M.

The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In an effort to be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.<ref>Kurt E. Kinbacher, and William G.

Much of this work was undertaken by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]], and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys, and became known as \"The Great Reconnaissance\".

Private companies were to build and operate the line. Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work. [[Theodore Judah]], the chief engineer of the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah's tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 [[Pacific Railroad Act]], which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the [[History of the Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] (which built west from Omaha).<ref>David Haward Bain, ''[[Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad]]'' New York: Penguin Books (1999) p.&nbsp;155</ref> In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants ([[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]]) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.\n\nThe road was built with mortgages from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money\u2014later repaid\u2014at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.\n\nMost of the manual laborers on the Central Pacific were new arrivals from China.<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Alexander Saxton|last1=Saxton|first1=Alexander|title=The Army of Canton in the High Sierra|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=35|issue=2|pages=141\u2013152|jstor=3636678|year=1966|doi=10.2307/3636678}}</ref> Kraus shows how these men lived and worked, and how they managed their money.

The work was highly physical, using horse-drawn plows and scrapers, and manual picks, axes, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were used. The rails were iron (steel came a few years later) and weighed {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}. and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used black powder. The Union Pacific construction crews, mostly Irish Americans, averaged about two miles (3&nbsp;km) of new track per day.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edwin Legrand Sabin|title=Building the Pacific railway: the construction-story of America's first iron thoroughfare between the Missouri river and California, from the inception of the great idea to the day, May 10, 1869, when the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific joined tracks at Promotory point, Utah, to form the nation's transcontinental|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXO6x1nSldYC&pg=PA13|year=1919|author-link=Edwin Legrand Sabin}}</ref>\n\nSix transcontinental railroads were built in the [[Gilded Age]] (plus two in Canada); they opened up the West to farmers and ranchers. From north to south they were the Northern Pacific, [[Milwaukee Road]], and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] along the Canada\u2013US border; the Union Pacific/Central Pacific in the middle, and to the south the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], and the Southern Pacific. All but the Great Northern of [[James J. Hill]] relied on land grants. The financial stories were often complex. For example, the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in 1864. Financier [[Jay Cooke]] (1821\u20131905) was in charge until 1873, when he went bankrupt. Federal courts, however, kept bankrupt railroads in operation. In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] (1835\u20131900) took over and finally completed the line to Seattle. But the line went bankrupt in the [[Panic of 1893]] and Hill took it over. He then merged several lines with financing from [[J.P. Morgan]], but President Theodore Roosevelt [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|broke them up in 1904]].<ref>Ross R. Cotroneo, \"The Northern Pacific: Years of Difficulty\", ''Kansas Quarterly'' (1970) 2#3 pp.&nbsp;69\u201377</ref>\n\nIn the first year of operation, 1869\u201370, 150,000 passengers made the long trip. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years. The railroads had \"Immigration Bureaus\" which advertised package low-cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia. The prairies, they were promised, did not mean backbreaking toil because \"settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber\".<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' pp.&nbsp;646\u20137</ref> The settlers were customers of the railroads, shipping their crops and cattle out, and bringing in manufactured products. All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business.<ref>Sarah Gordon, ''Passage to Union: How the Railroads Transformed American Life, 1829\u20131929'' (1998)</ref>\n\nWhite concludes with a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many thousands of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east\u2013west axis, and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.<ref>Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011)</ref>\n\n=== Migration after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Picturesque America58.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'', 1872, shows settlers crossing the [[Great Plains]]. By [[F.O.C. Darley]] and engraved by [[Henry Bryan Hall|H.B. Hall]].]]\nAfter the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising \"the Best Prairie Lands\", \"Low Prices\", \"Large Discounts For Cash\", and \"Better Terms Than Ever!\". The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable.<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' ch 32</ref>\n\nThe fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to faced challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and fearsome tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/ourstory/activities/sodhouse/more.html|title=Life on the Prairie |publisher=American History |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}</ref> In the treeless prairies homesteaders built sod houses.

U.S. Secretary of State [[William Seward]] negotiated with the Russians to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska, an area roughly one-fifth the size of the rest of the United States. On March 30, 1867, the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russians for $7.2&nbsp;million ($118&nbsp;million in today's dollars). The transfer ceremony was completed in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] on October 18, 1867, as Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army.\n\nCritics at the time decried the purchase as \"Seward's Folly\", reasoning that there was no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold, icy climate. Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slowly, the discovery of gold fields during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1896, [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1898, and [[Fairbanks Gold Rush]] in 1902 brought thousands of miners into the territory, thus propelling Alaska's prosperity for decades to come. Major oil discoveries in the late 20th century made the state rich.<ref>Howard Kushner, \"The significance of the Alaska purchase to American expansion.\" in S. Frederick Starr, ed., ''Russia's American Colony''. (1987): 295\u2013315.</ref>\n\n=== Annexation of Hawaii ===\n{{Main|Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}\nOn January 17, 1893, the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was overthrown when a group of American and European businessmen and sugar planters forced Queen [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] to abdicate her throne. That same day, the coup organizers created the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] and appointed Hawaiian jurist [[Sanford Ballard Dole]] as the islands' first President, hoping that Hawaii would be annexed by the United States. Within 48 hours after the overthrow, the new Hawaiian government was recognized by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the U.S., United Kingdom, and Japan.\n\nU.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] insisted that Lili\u02bbuokalani be restored back to her throne, but Dole refused and instead proclaimed the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] on July 4, 1894. Cleveland was unwilling to overthrow the government by force, and his successor, [[William McKinley]], negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Hawaii in 1897. In April 1898, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] broke out, and the strategic use of a [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in the Pacific during the war convinced the U.S. government the necessity for the Hawaiian annexation. On July 4, 1898, Congress passed the [[Newlands Resolution]], which annexed Hawaii. It was signed into law by President McKinley three days later and came into effect on August 12, 1898, officially creating the [[Territory of Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hyslop|first=Stephen G.|title=National Geographic: The Old West|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-1555-1|pages=230\u201345}}</ref>\n\n== Indian Wars ==\n\n[[File:Sitting Bull.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief [[Sitting Bull]]]]\n{{Main|American Indian Wars}}\n\nIndian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories; the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi.

The Indians were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of President [[Andrew Jackson]] demanded removal of the Indians out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The [[Jacksonian Democracy]] proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832 and 1836. By 1837 the \"Indian Removal policy\" began, to implement the act of Congress signed by [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson.<ref>However Jackson's policy is defended as benign by Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2001) pp.&nbsp;226\u201353, and by Francis Paul Prucha, \"Andrew Jackson's Indian Policy: A Reassessment\", ''Journal of American History'' (1969) 56:527\u201339 {{JSTOR|1904204}}.</ref> The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Indians, but in reality the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards.<ref>Alfred A.

To motivate Natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. By 1835 the Cherokee, the last Indian nation in the South, had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma. All the tribes were given new land in the \"[[Indian Territory]]\" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Indians removed, about 18,000 died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route.<ref>Osborn, William M., ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', Random House (2001) Chapter 7: Atrocities from the Trail of Tears to the Civil War. {{ISBN|978-0375758560}}</ref> This exodus has become known as [[The Trail of Tears]] (in Cherokee \"''Nunna dual Tsuny''\", \"The Trail Where they Cried\"). The impact of the removals was severe. The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area.<ref>Theda Perdue, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2008) ch.&nbsp;6, 7</ref>\n\nThe only way for an Indian to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many Natives who took the offer were defrauded by \"ravenous speculators\" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached {{convert|3800000|acre|km2}}. Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20&nbsp;million.<ref>John K.

The Indians emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts, developing a logistics system, and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces. Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the \"modern\" warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines, using its vast advantages in population and resources. Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U.S. Army. The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and, therefore, were unable to have any permanent success against the Army.<ref>Anthony R. McGinnis, \"When Courage Was Not Enough: Plains Indians at War with the United States Army\", ''Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#2 pp.&nbsp;455\u2013473.</ref>\n\nIndian wars were fought throughout the western regions, with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and the Natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Michno, ''Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850\u20131890'' p.&nbsp;367</ref>\n\nOne of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the [[Snake War]] in 1864\u20131868, which was conducted by a confederacy of [[Northern Paiute]], [[Bannock people|Bannock]] and [[Shoshone]] Native Americans, called the \"Snake Indians\" against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Oregon, Volume II, 1848\u20131888'', The History Company, San Francisco, 1888, p.&nbsp;462, note&nbsp;4.</ref> The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the [[Snake River]] Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.<ref>Michno, Gregory, ''The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864\u20131868''.

The conflict was fought in 1863\u20131865 while the American Civil War was still ongoing. Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region, the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties. White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Indian women and children such as the bloody [[Sand Creek massacre]], and the Indians also raided ranches, farms and killed white families such as the [[American Ranch massacre]] and [[Raid on Godfrey Ranch]].<ref>Hyde, George E.

They served as bases for troops at or near strategic areas, particularly for counteracting the Indian presence. For example, [[Fort Bowie]] protected [[Apache Pass]] in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against [[Cochise]] and [[Geronimo]]. [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Fort Kearny]] helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners. Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux. As Indian reservations sprang up, the military set up forts to protect them. Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines. Other important forts were [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]], Arkansas, [[Fort Snelling]], Minnesota, [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], New Mexico, [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and [[Fort Walla Walla]] in Washington. [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska, was home to the [[Department of the Platte]], and was responsible for outfitting most Western posts for more than 20 years after its founding in the late 1870s.

Robert L. Munkres read 66 diaries of parties traveling the Oregon Trail between 1834 and 1860 to estimate the actual dangers they faced from Indian attacks in Nebraska and Wyoming. The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all. However many did report harassment by Indians who begged or demanded tolls, and stole horses and cattle.<ref>Robert L.

A second treaty secured safe passage along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] for wagon trains. In return, the tribes would receive, for ten years, annual compensation for damages caused by migrants.<ref>Burton S. Hill, \"The Great Indian Treaty Council of 1851\", ''Nebraska History'', (1966) 47#1 pp.&nbsp;85\u2013110</ref> The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas as the federal government sought those lands for the future [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]]. In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes, causing considerable friction. In Utah, the [[Mormons]] also moved in before federal ownership was obtained.\n\nA new policy of establishing reservations came gradually into shape after the boundaries of the \"Indian Territory\" began to be ignored. In providing for Indian reservations, Congress and the [[Office of Indian Affairs]] hoped to de-tribalize Native Americans and prepare them for integration with the rest of American society, the \"ultimate incorporation into the great body of our citizen population\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Francis Paul|last=Prucha|title=The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&pg=PA324|year=1995|publisher=U. of Nebraska Press|page=324|isbn=0-8032-8734-8}}</ref> This allowed for the development of dozens of riverfront towns along the [[Missouri River]] in the new [[Nebraska Territory]], which was carved from the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase after the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].

The American frontiersmen relied on individual effort, in the context of very large quantities of unsettled land with weak external enemies. Israel by contrast, operated in a very small geographical zone, surrounded by more powerful neighbors. The Jewish pioneer was not building an individual or family enterprise, but was a conscious participant in nation building, with a high priority on collective and cooperative planned settlements. The Israeli pioneers brought in American experts on irrigation and agriculture to provide technical advice. However they rejected the American frontier model in favor of a European model that supported their political and security concerns.<ref>S.

The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools all contributed to this trend.<ref>Chad Montrie, \"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp.&nbsp;245\u2013258</ref>\n\nAlthough the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as [[barn raising]]s, corn huskings, quilting bees,<ref>Karl Ronning, \"Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880\u20131920\", ''Uncoverings'', (1992) Vol. 13, pp.&nbsp;169\u2013191</ref> [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange meetings]],<ref>Donald B.

One group of scholars, following the lead of novelists [[Willa Cather]] and [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris<ref>Katherine Harris, ''Long Vistas: Women and Families on Colorado Homesteads'' (1993)</ref> and Elliott West<ref>Elliott West, ''Growing Up with the Country: Childhood on the Far Western Frontier'' (1989)</ref> write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten<ref>Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Settlers' Children: Growing Up on the Great Plains'' (1991)</ref> and Lillian Schlissel<ref>Lillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens and Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Far from Home: Families of the Westward Journey'' (2002)</ref> offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (1300+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The [[Chisholm Trail]], laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5&nbsp;million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the {{convert|800|mi|km}} from south Texas to [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3&nbsp;km) of cattle six abreast. Despite the risks, a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved, as the price of one steer was $4 in Texas and $40 back East.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ted|last=Morgan|title=Shovel of Stars: The Making of the American West 1800 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aveRrVPqc0UC&pg=PA257|year=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=257|isbn=978-0-684-81492-6}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1870s and 1880s, cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakota territory, using the rails to ship to both coasts.

A severe winter engulfed the plains toward the end of 1886 and well into 1887, locking the prairie grass under ice and crusted snow which starving herds could not penetrate. The British lost most of their money\u2014as did eastern investors like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], but their investments did create a large industry that continues to cycle through boom and bust periods.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3111428|title = The Investment Boom in British-Texan Cattle Companies 1880\u20131885|journal = The Business History Review|volume = 34|issue = 4|pages = 421\u2013445|last1 = Graham|first1 = Richard|year = 1960|doi = 10.2307/3111428}}</ref>\n\nOn a much smaller scale sheep grazing was locally popular; sheep were easier to feed and needed less water. However, Americans did not eat mutton. As farmers moved in [[open range]] cattle ranching came to an end and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water, breeding, feeding, and grazing could be controlled. This led to \"fence wars\" which erupted over disputes about water rights.<ref>Everett Dick, ''Vanguards of the Frontier: A Social History of the Northern Plains and Rocky Mountains from the Fur Traders to the Busters'' (1941) pp 497\u2013508.</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Montejano|title=Anglos and Mexicans in the Making of Texas, 1836\u20131986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YnUKT4f_fZQC&pg=PA87|year=1987|publisher=U. of Texas Press|page=87|isbn=9780292788077}}</ref>\n\n==== Cowboys ====\n\n[[File:Charles Marion Russell - Buccaroos (1902).jpg|thumb|A classic image of the American [[cowboy]], as portrayed by [[Charles Marion Russell|C.M.

His real-life was a hard one and revolved around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard-earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. Working the cattle was not just a routine job but also a lifestyle that exulted in the freedom of the wide unsettled outdoors on horseback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ii.015|title=Cowboy Culture|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|last=Wishart|first=David J.}}</ref> Long drives hired one cowboy for about 250 head of cattle.<ref name=\"Howard R.

All the distinct clothing of the cowboy\u2014boots, saddles, hats, pants, [[chaps]], slickers, [[bandanna]]s, gloves, and collar-less shirts\u2014were practical and adaptable, designed for protection and comfort.

The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying. While camping every night, cowboys would often sing to their herd to keep them calm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingstories.com/Stories/Why%20Cowboys%20Sing.pdf|title=Why Cowboys Sing?|publisher=Wyoming Stories|first=Wylie Grant|last=Sherwin}}</ref> The workdays often lasted fourteen hours, with just six hours of sleep. It was grueling, dusty work, with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day. On the trail, drinking, gambling, and brawling were often prohibited and fined, and sometimes cursing as well. It was monotonous and boring work, with food to match: bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried fruit, and potatoes.

Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Dodge City]], and [[Ellsworth, Kansas|Ellsworth]] experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became [[ghost town]]s and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued on after the grazing lands were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert R.|last=Dykstra|title=The Cattle Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t15L9AfXlPcC&pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6561-5}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation and environmentalism ==\n {{See also|Sagebrush Rebellion}}\n[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|1908 editorial cartoon of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] features his cowboy persona and his crusading for conservation.]]\n\nConcern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late 19th century, pitting different interests. On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum [[exploitation of natural resources]] to maximize jobs, economic growth, and their own profit.<ref>Char Miller, ''Gifford Pinchot and the making of modern environmentalism'' (2001) p.&nbsp;4</ref>\n\nIn the center were the [[conservation movement|conservationists]], led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his coalition of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with [[Gifford Pinchot]] and used the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230&nbsp;million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi{{sup|2}} or 930,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, [[national park]]s, and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.<ref>Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt explained his position in 1910:\n\n{{quote|Conservation means development as much as it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.<ref>W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003) p.&nbsp;25</ref>}}\n\nThe third element, smallest at first but growing rapidly after 1870, were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake, and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits. Their leader was [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914), a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake, and founder of the [[Sierra Club]]. Muir, based in California, in 1889 started organizing support to preserve the [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoias]] in the [[Yosemite Valley]]; Congress did pass the [[Yosemite National Park]] bill (1890). In 1897 President [[Grover Cleveland]] created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move. Muir, taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet,<ref>Dennis C. Williams, ''God's wilds: John Muir's vision of nature'' (2002) p.&nbsp;134</ref> crusaded against the lumberman, portraying it as a contest \"between landscape righteousness and the devil\".<ref>Robert L. Dorman, ''A word for nature: four pioneering environmental advocates, 1845\u20131913'' (1998) p.&nbsp;159</ref> A master publicist, Muir's magazine articles, in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (June 5, 1897) and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' turned the tide of public sentiment.<ref>John Muir, [http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=atla;idno=atla0080-2 \"The American Forests\"]</ref> He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt's program of setting aside national monuments, national forest reserves, and national parks. However Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President [[William Howard Taft]] on the [[Hetch Hetchy]] dam, which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco. Biographer [[Donald Worster]] says, \"Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Worster|title=A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuAsAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.

Once numbering over 25&nbsp;million on the [[Great Plains]], the grass-eating herds were a vital resource animal for the [[Plains Indians]], providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction.

[[Conservation in the United States|Conservationists]] founded the [[American Bison Society]] in 1905; it lobbied Congress to establish public bison herds. Several national parks in the U.S. and Canada were created, in part to provide a sanctuary for bison and other large wildlife, with no hunting allowed.<ref>Glenn E.

During the same period, [[P. T. Barnum]] presented Indian chiefs, dances, and other Wild West exhibits in his museums. However, large scale awareness really took off when the [[dime novel]] appeared in 1859, the first being ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter''.<ref>Robert M. Utley (2003), p.&nbsp;253</ref> By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public's attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism, and fixed in the public's mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains\u2014courageous cowboys and savage Indians, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days. The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S. Ellis' ''Seth Jones'' (1860). [[Ned Buntline]]'s stories glamorized [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Edward Lytton Wheeler|Edward L. Wheeler]] created \"[[Deadwood Dick]]\", \"Hurricane Nell\", and \"Calamity Jane\".<ref>Howard R. Lamar (1977), pp.&nbsp;303\u2013304</ref>\n\nBuffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U.S. and Europe. He presented the first \"Wild West\" show in 1883, featuring a recreation of famous battles (especially Custer's Last Stand), expert marksmanship, and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and Indians, as well as sure-shooting [[Annie Oakley]].<ref>Joy S.

Cowboy, Pinkerton detective, and western author, Siringo was the first authentic cowboy autobiographer. Adams spent the 1880s in the cattle industry in Texas and 1890s mining in the Rockies. When an 1898 play's portrayal of Texans outraged Adams, he started writing plays, short stories, and novels drawn from his own experiences. His ''The Log of a Cowboy'' (1903) became a classic novel about the cattle business, especially the cattle drive.<ref>{{cite book|first=Andy|last=Adams|title=The log of a cowboy: a narrative of the old trail days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ho4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PP1|year=1903|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company}}, full text</ref> It described a fictional drive of the Circle Dot herd from Texas to Montana in 1882, and became a leading source on cowboy life; historians retraced its path in the 1960s, confirming its basic accuracy.

It began in organized fashion in the West in the 1880s, when several Western cities followed up on touring Wild West shows and organized celebrations that included rodeo activities. The establishment of major cowboy competitions in the East in the 1920s led to the growth of rodeo sports. Trail cowboys who were also known as gunfighters like [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Luke Short]] and others, were known for their prowess, [[Fast draw|speed]] and skill with their pistols and other firearms. Their violent escapades and reputations morphed over time into the stereotypical image of violence endured by the \"cowboy hero\".<ref name=\"Watts\" /><ref>Jeremy Agnew, ''The Creation of the Cowboy Hero: Fiction, Film and Fact''(McFarland, 2014) pp.&nbsp;38\u201340, 88. {{ISBN|978-0786478392}}</ref><ref>Robert K.

The Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] seized upon the statistic to announce the end of the era in which the frontier process shaped the American character. When examining the later [[1900 United States Census|1900 U.S. Census]] [[c:File:Distribution_of_US_Rural_Population_during_1900.pdf|population distribution]] results though, a frontier line does still remain. But by the [[1910 United States Census|1910 U.S. Census]], only pockets of the frontier remain without a clear westward line, allowing travel across the continental United States without ever entering it possible for the first time.\n\nFresh farmland was increasingly hard to find after 1890\u2014although the railroads advertised some in eastern Montana. Bicha shows that nearly 600,000 American farmers sought cheap land by moving to the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie frontier of the Canadian West]] from 1897 to 1914.

These contained plenty of unoccupied land, as did the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Typical frontier crimes such as the [[Jarbidge Stage Robbery|last stagecoach robbery]] occurred in Nevada's remaining frontier in December 1916. [[American Indian Wars|Conflict]] between the U.S. Government, American Indians, and settlers also continued into the early 1920s, shown in events such as the [[Bluff War]] (1914\u20131915) and [[Posey War]] (1923).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSoon, the ethos and storyline of the \"American frontier\" had passed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Cloud|title=The Coming of the Frontier Press: How the West Was Really Won|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LVzRxYMIOMC&pg=PA17|year=2008|publisher=Northwestern University Press|pages=17\u201318|isbn=978-0-8101-2508-7}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\n\nScores of Turner students became professors in history departments in the western states, and taught courses on the frontier.<ref>Richard Etulain, ed.

It avoids the word \"frontier\" and stresses cultural interaction between white culture and groups such as Indians and Hispanics. History professor William Weeks of the University of San Diego argues that in this \"New Western History\" approach:\n\n{{quote|It is easy to tell who the bad guys are \u2013 they are almost invariably white, male, and middle-class or better, while the good guys are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class....

The first group emphasizes human agency on the environment; the second looks at the influence of the environment. [[William Cronon]] has argued that Turner's famous 1893 essay was environmental history in an embryonic form. It emphasized the vast power of free land to attract and reshape settlers, making a transition from wilderness to civilization.<ref>Andrew C.

He compared the effects of the railroad opening up Western lands to urban transportation systems and the automobile, and Western settlers' \"land hunger\" to poor city residents seeking social status. Just as the Republican party benefited from support from \"old\" immigrant groups that settled on frontier farms, \"new\" urban immigrants formed an important part of the Democratic [[New Deal coalition]] that began with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s victory in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]].<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | last=Lubell|first=Samuel | year=1956 | pages=65\u201368, 82\u201383 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s an active center is the history department at the [[University of New Mexico]], along with the University of New Mexico Press.

This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]], giving rise to the [[expansionism|expansionist]] philosophy known as \"[[Manifest Destiny]]\".\n\nA \"[[frontier]]\" is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement. Leading theorist [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] went deeper, arguing that the frontier was the defining process of American civilization: \"The frontier,\" he asserted, \"promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people.\" He theorized it was a process of development: \"This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward...furnish[es] the forces dominating American character.\"<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History, in Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) pp. 1\u201338. [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/afp/turner.htm online]</ref> Turner's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians (and critics) to explore multiple individual American frontiers, but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Texas]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\nIn 19th- and early 20th-century media, enormous popular attention was focused on the [[Western United States]] in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, from the 1850s to the 1910s, a period sometimes called the '''Old West''' or the '''Wild West'''. Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect. This eventually inspired the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre of film, which spilled over into [[television show]]s, [[Western fiction|novels]], [[comic books]], and [[video game]]s, as well as children's toys and costumes.\n\nAs defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states.\" They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Robert V. | last=Hine | author2=John Mack Faragher | title=The American West: A New Interpretive History | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | year=2000 | page=[https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 10] | isbn=978-0300078350 | url=https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 }}</ref>  Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans: \"The existence of an area of\nfree land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.\"<ref>Quoted in William Cronon,  \"Revisiting the vanishing frontier: The legacy of Frederick Jackson Turner.\" ''Western Historical Quarterly'' 18.2 (1987): 157\u2013176, at p. 157.</ref> Through treaties with foreign nations and [[Native Americans in the United States|native tribes]], political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, the building of farms, ranches, and towns, the marking of trails and digging of mines, and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Turner, in his \"[[Frontier Thesis]]\" (1893), theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as [[individualism]], self-reliance, and even violence.\n\nAs the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took a firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike.

The American frontier began when [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia, was settled by the English in 1607. In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic coast, until about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier'' (5th ed. 2001) ch.&nbsp;1\u20137</ref> English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these [[habitants]] settled in villages along the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and midwest region they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]]<ref>Clarence Walworth Alvord, ''The Illinois Country 1673\u20131818'' (1918)</ref> as well as a larger settlement around [[New Orleans]]. Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning [[patroon]]s who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.<ref>Sung Bok Kim, ''Landlord and Tenant in Colonial New York: Manorial Society, 1664\u20131775'' (1987)</ref>\n\nAreas in the north that were in the frontier stage by 1700 generally had poor transportation facilities, so the opportunity for commercial agriculture was low. These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture, and as a result, by the 1760s these societies were highly egalitarian, as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main:\n{{quote|The typical frontier society, therefore, was one in which class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and there were a number of landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.<ref>Jackson Turner Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;11.</ref>}}\n\nIn the South, frontier areas that lacked transportation, such as the Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However, frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought up the good land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer \"frontier\". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.<ref>Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;44\u201346.</ref>\n{{anchor|The Near West|Near West|near west}}<!-- redirect target - -->\n\n=== From British peasants to American farmers ===\n\nThe seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers, and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farmland.<ref>Allan Kulikoff, ''From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers'' (2000)</ref> Unlike Britain, where a small number of landlords owned most of the good land, ownership in America was cheap, easy and widespread.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|peace treaty of 1763]], France lost practically everything, as the lands west of the Mississippi river, in addition to Florida and New Orleans, went to Spain.

By the 1830s, however, the West was filling up with squatters who had no legal deed, although they may have paid money to previous settlers. The [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] favored the squatters by promising rapid access to cheap land. By contrast, [[Henry Clay]] was alarmed at the \"lawless rabble\" heading West who were undermining the utopian concept of a law-abiding, stable middle-class republican community.

The postal service likewise assisted the Army in expanding control over the vast western territories. The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail, such as the ''New York Weekly Tribune'', facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The postal service helped to integrate already established areas with the frontier, creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.<ref>William H.

One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity.

Most were farmers who moved in family groups.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' (5th ed. 1982) pp.&nbsp;203\u2013328, 747\u201366</ref>\n\nHistorian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was; they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up, they sold out and moved west to try again. Hacker describes that in Kentucky about 1812:\n\n{{quote|Farms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, possessing log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, enclosed in fences, and having plenty of standing timber for fuel. The land was sown in wheat and corn, which were the staples, while hemp [for making rope] was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms....\n\nYet, on the whole, it was an agricultural society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1892931|title = Western Land Hunger and the War of 1812: A Conjecture|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 365\u2013395|last1 = Hacker|first1 = Louis Morton|year = 1924|doi = 10.2307/1892931}}</ref>}}\nHacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land, repaired the damage, and practiced a more sustainable agriculture.

The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve pre\u00ebminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) p.&nbsp;342.</ref>}}\n\n=== Manifest Destiny ===\n{{Main|Manifest Destiny}}\n[[File:United States 1834-1836-03.png|thumb|upright=1.6|United States territories in 1834\u201336]]\nManifest Destiny was the belief that the United States was preordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast.

In the 1840s the Tyler and Polk administrations (1841\u201349) successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine.

A few hundred foreigners were scattered in the northern districts, including some Americans. With the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846 the U.S. sent in Fr\u00e9mont and a [[U.S. Army]] unit, as well as naval forces, and quickly took control.<ref>Kevin Starr, ''California: A History'' (2007) pp.&nbsp;43\u201370</ref> As the war was ending, gold was discovered in the north, and the word soon spread worldwide.\n\nThousands of \"Forty-Niners\" reached California, by sailing around South America (or taking a short-cut through disease-ridden Panama), or walked the California trail. The population soared to over 200,000 in 1852, mostly in the gold districts that stretched into the mountains east of San Francisco.\n\nHousing in San Francisco was at a premium, and abandoned ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging. In the gold fields themselves living conditions were primitive, though the mild climate proved attractive. Supplies were expensive and food poor, typical diets consisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. These highly male, transient communities with no established institutions were prone to high levels of violence, drunkenness, profanity, and greed-driven behavior. Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their own ad hoc legal system, based on the \"mining codes\" used in other mining communities abroad. Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote, sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantis; with Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon Morris Bakken|title=Law in the western United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjHQWyttp6QC&pg=PA209|year=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=209\u201314|isbn=9780806132150}}</ref>\n\nThe gold rush radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals, including precious metal specialists, merchants, doctors, and attorneys, who added to the population of miners, saloon keepers, gamblers, and prostitutes.

In a few years, nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, at the end of the '49 gold rush, through 1883, [[hydraulic mining]] was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. Hydraulic mining ended when public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.<ref>Walter Nugent, ''American West Chronicle'' (2007) p 119.</ref>\n\nThe mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to [[Dakota Territory|South Dakota]] contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites, where prospectors discovered gold, silver, copper and other minerals (as well as some soft-rock coal). Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight; most became [[ghost towns]] when the ores were depleted. Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest.

They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the [[Oregon Trail]]. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1979).</ref>\n\nIn the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", some 700 to 1,000 emigrants headed for Oregon; missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] led the wagons on the last leg.

Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated. Some returned with bags of gold and silver. Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west.

California unanimously rejected slavery in 1850 and became a free state. New Mexico allowed slavery, but it was rarely seen there. Kansas was off limits to slavery by the Compromise of 1820. Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms. Few Southern planters were actually interested in Kansas, but the idea that slavery was illegal there implied they had a second-class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor, and seemed to violate the principle of [[state's rights]]. With the passage of the extremely controversial [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery: [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called \"Jayhawkers\" or \"Free-soilers\") financed the migration of politically determined settlers.

Throughout the 19th century, Army officers typically served built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement. Actual combat experience was uncommon for any one soldier.<ref>Samuel J. Watson, ''Peacekeepers and Conquerors: The Army Officer Corps on the American Frontier, 1821\u20131846'' (2013)</ref>\n\nThe most dramatic conflict was the [[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux war in Minnesota]] in 1862, when Dakota tribes systematically attacked German farms in an effort to drive out the settlers. Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], slaughtered 300 to 400 white settlers. The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops. The ensuing battles at [[Battle of Fort Ridgely|Fort Ridgely]], [[Battle of Birch Coulee|Birch Coulee]], [[Fort Abercrombie]], and [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]] punctuated a six-week war, which ended in American victory. The federal government tried 425 Indians for murder, and 303 were convicted and sentenced to death. Lincoln pardoned the majority, but 38 leaders were hanged.<ref>Kenneth Carley, ''The Dakota War of 1862'' (Minnesota Historical Society, 2nd ed. 2001)</ref>\n\nThe decreased presence of Union troops in the West left behind untrained militias; hostile tribes used the opportunity to attack settlers.

The result by 1890 was millions of new farms in the Plains states, many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia.\n\n== The Postbellum West ==\n\n=== Territorial governance after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Fsstockade.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] Stockade, February 1869]]\n\nWith the war over and slavery abolished, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much \"red tape\", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.<ref>Jack Ericson Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires: Governors and Territorial Government, 1784\u20131912'' (U. of Pittsburgh Press 1968)</ref>\n\nFederal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.<ref>Richard White (1991), p.&nbsp;177</ref>\n\nTerritorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.<ref>Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires'' p.&nbsp;190</ref>\n\nThese improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering. As [[Mark Twain]] wrote while working for his brother, the secretary of Nevada, \"The government of my country snubs honest simplicity, but fondles artistic villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Twain|title=Roughing it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAZEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA181|year=1913|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=181}}</ref> \"Territorial rings\", corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage, embezzled from Indian tribes and local citizens, especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Phillips|author2=Alan Axelrod|title=Encyclopedia of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MNXAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Simon & Schuster|volume=2|isbn=9780028974958}}</ref>\n\n=== Federal land system ===\n\n[[File:Homesteader NE 1866.png|thumb|[[Homestead Act of 1862|Homesteaders]] [[circa|c.]] 1866]]\n\nIn acquiring, preparing, and distributing public land to private ownership, the federal government generally followed the system set forth by the [[Land Ordinance of 1785|Land Ordinance]] of 1785. Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaty, land title would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10&nbsp;km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at [[public auction]]. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.<ref>Richard White (1991), ch 6</ref>\n\nAs part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of \"land script\". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vernon Webster Johnson|author2=Raleigh Barlowe|title=Land Problems and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoHUQQFXzKAC&pg=PA40|year=1979|publisher=Ayer Publishing|page=40|isbn=9780405113789}}</ref> Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious. As a counter to land speculators, farmers formed \"claims clubs\" to enable them to buy larger tracts than the {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1902928|title = The Iowa Claim Clubs: Symbol and Substance|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 45|issue = 2|pages = 231\u2013253|last1 = Bogue|first1 = Allan G.|year = 1958|doi = 10.2307/1902928}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, Congress passed three important bills that transformed the land system. The [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]] granted {{convert|160|acre|km2}} free to each settler who improved the land for five years; citizens and non-citizens including squatters and women, were all eligible. The only cost was a modest filing fee. The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states. Many took free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates.<ref>Harold M. Hyman, ''American Singularity: The 1787 Northwest Ordinance, the 1862 Homestead and Morrill Acts, and the 1944 GI Bill'' (U of Georgia Press, 2008)</ref><ref>Sarah T.

The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In an effort to be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.<ref>Kurt E. Kinbacher, and William G. Thoms III, \"Shaping Nebraska\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'' (2008) 28#3 pp.&nbsp;191\u2013207.</ref>\n\nThe [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 provided land grants to states to begin colleges of agriculture and mechanical arts (engineering). Black colleges became eligible for these land grants in 1890. The Act succeeded in its goals to open new universities and make farming more scientific and profitable.<ref>{{cite book|author=David J.

Much of this work was undertaken by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]], and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys, and became known as \"The Great Reconnaissance\". Regionalism animated debates in Congress regarding the choice of a northern, central or southern route. Engineering requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood, and as nearly-level route as possible, given the weak locomotives of the era.<ref>Frank N.

With the secession of the Confederate states in 1861, the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California. Private companies were to build and operate the line. Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work. [[Theodore Judah]], the chief engineer of the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah's tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 [[Pacific Railroad Act]], which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the [[History of the Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] (which built west from Omaha).<ref>David Haward Bain, ''[[Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad]]'' New York: Penguin Books (1999) p.&nbsp;155</ref> In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants ([[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]]) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.\n\nThe road was built with mortgages from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money\u2014later repaid\u2014at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain.

The work was highly physical, using horse-drawn plows and scrapers, and manual picks, axes, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were used. The rails were iron (steel came a few years later) and weighed {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}. and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used black powder.

From north to south they were the Northern Pacific, [[Milwaukee Road]], and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] along the Canada\u2013US border; the Union Pacific/Central Pacific in the middle, and to the south the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], and the Southern Pacific. All but the Great Northern of [[James J. Hill]] relied on land grants. The financial stories were often complex. For example, the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in 1864. Financier [[Jay Cooke]] (1821\u20131905) was in charge until 1873, when he went bankrupt. Federal courts, however, kept bankrupt railroads in operation. In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] (1835\u20131900) took over and finally completed the line to Seattle. But the line went bankrupt in the [[Panic of 1893]] and Hill took it over. He then merged several lines with financing from [[J.P. Morgan]], but President Theodore Roosevelt [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|broke them up in 1904]].<ref>Ross R. Cotroneo, \"The Northern Pacific: Years of Difficulty\", ''Kansas Quarterly'' (1970) 2#3 pp.&nbsp;69\u201377</ref>\n\nIn the first year of operation, 1869\u201370, 150,000 passengers made the long trip. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years. The railroads had \"Immigration Bureaus\" which advertised package low-cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia. The prairies, they were promised, did not mean backbreaking toil because \"settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber\".<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' pp.&nbsp;646\u20137</ref> The settlers were customers of the railroads, shipping their crops and cattle out, and bringing in manufactured products. All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business.<ref>Sarah Gordon, ''Passage to Union: How the Railroads Transformed American Life, 1829\u20131929'' (1998)</ref>\n\nWhite concludes with a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many thousands of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east\u2013west axis, and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.<ref>Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011)</ref>\n\n=== Migration after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Picturesque America58.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'', 1872, shows settlers crossing the [[Great Plains]].

The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable.<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' ch 32</ref>\n\nThe fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions.

U.S. Secretary of State [[William Seward]] negotiated with the Russians to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska, an area roughly one-fifth the size of the rest of the United States. On March 30, 1867, the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russians for $7.2&nbsp;million ($118&nbsp;million in today's dollars). The transfer ceremony was completed in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] on October 18, 1867, as Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army.\n\nCritics at the time decried the purchase as \"Seward's Folly\", reasoning that there was no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold, icy climate. Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slowly, the discovery of gold fields during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1896, [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1898, and [[Fairbanks Gold Rush]] in 1902 brought thousands of miners into the territory, thus propelling Alaska's prosperity for decades to come. Major oil discoveries in the late 20th century made the state rich.<ref>Howard Kushner, \"The significance of the Alaska purchase to American expansion.\" in S. Frederick Starr, ed., ''Russia's American Colony''.

That same day, the coup organizers created the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] and appointed Hawaiian jurist [[Sanford Ballard Dole]] as the islands' first President, hoping that Hawaii would be annexed by the United States. Within 48 hours after the overthrow, the new Hawaiian government was recognized by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the U.S., United Kingdom, and Japan.\n\nU.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] insisted that Lili\u02bbuokalani be restored back to her throne, but Dole refused and instead proclaimed the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] on July 4, 1894. Cleveland was unwilling to overthrow the government by force, and his successor, [[William McKinley]], negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Hawaii in 1897. In April 1898, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] broke out, and the strategic use of a [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in the Pacific during the war convinced the U.S. government the necessity for the Hawaiian annexation. On July 4, 1898, Congress passed the [[Newlands Resolution]], which annexed Hawaii. It was signed into law by President McKinley three days later and came into effect on August 12, 1898, officially creating the [[Territory of Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hyslop|first=Stephen G.|title=National Geographic: The Old West|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-1555-1|pages=230\u201345}}</ref>\n\n== Indian Wars ==\n\n[[File:Sitting Bull.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief [[Sitting Bull]]]]\n{{Main|American Indian Wars}}\n\nIndian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories; the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi.

The Indians were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of President [[Andrew Jackson]] demanded removal of the Indians out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The [[Jacksonian Democracy]] proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832 and 1836. By 1837 the \"Indian Removal policy\" began, to implement the act of Congress signed by [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson.<ref>However Jackson's policy is defended as benign by Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2001) pp.&nbsp;226\u201353, and by Francis Paul Prucha, \"Andrew Jackson's Indian Policy: A Reassessment\", ''Journal of American History'' (1969) 56:527\u201339 {{JSTOR|1904204}}.</ref> The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Indians, but in reality the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards.<ref>Alfred A.

To motivate Natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. By 1835 the Cherokee, the last Indian nation in the South, had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma. All the tribes were given new land in the \"[[Indian Territory]]\" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Indians removed, about 18,000 died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route.<ref>Osborn, William M., ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', Random House (2001) Chapter 7: Atrocities from the Trail of Tears to the Civil War. {{ISBN|978-0375758560}}</ref> This exodus has become known as [[The Trail of Tears]] (in Cherokee \"''Nunna dual Tsuny''\", \"The Trail Where they Cried\"). The impact of the removals was severe. The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area.<ref>Theda Perdue, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2008) ch.&nbsp;6, 7</ref>\n\nThe only way for an Indian to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many Natives who took the offer were defrauded by \"ravenous speculators\" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached {{convert|3800000|acre|km2}}. Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20&nbsp;million.<ref>John K.

The Indians emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts, developing a logistics system, and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces. Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the \"modern\" warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines, using its vast advantages in population and resources. Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U.S. Army. The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and, therefore, were unable to have any permanent success against the Army.<ref>Anthony R. McGinnis, \"When Courage Was Not Enough: Plains Indians at War with the United States Army\", ''Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#2 pp.&nbsp;455\u2013473.</ref>\n\nIndian wars were fought throughout the western regions, with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and the Natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Michno, ''Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850\u20131890'' p.&nbsp;367</ref>\n\nOne of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the [[Snake War]] in 1864\u20131868, which was conducted by a confederacy of [[Northern Paiute]], [[Bannock people|Bannock]] and [[Shoshone]] Native Americans, called the \"Snake Indians\" against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Oregon, Volume II, 1848\u20131888'', The History Company, San Francisco, 1888, p.&nbsp;462, note&nbsp;4.</ref> The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the [[Snake River]] Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.<ref>Michno, Gregory, ''The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864\u20131868''. Caldwell: Caxton Press, 2007. pp.&nbsp;345\u2013346</ref>\n\nThe [[Colorado War]] fought by [[Cheyenne]], Arapaho and Sioux, was fought in the territories of Colorado to Nebraska. The conflict was fought in 1863\u20131865 while the American Civil War was still ongoing. Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region, the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties. White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Indian women and children such as the bloody [[Sand Creek massacre]], and the Indians also raided ranches, farms and killed white families such as the [[American Ranch massacre]] and [[Raid on Godfrey Ranch]].<ref>Hyde, George E.

[[Fort Laramie]] and [[Fort Kearny]] helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners. Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux. As Indian reservations sprang up, the military set up forts to protect them. Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines. Other important forts were [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]], Arkansas, [[Fort Snelling]], Minnesota, [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], New Mexico, [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and [[Fort Walla Walla]] in Washington.

After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (1300+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The [[Chisholm Trail]], laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5&nbsp;million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the {{convert|800|mi|km}} from south Texas to [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3&nbsp;km) of cattle six abreast.

The [[cowboy hat]] quickly developed the capability, even in the early years, to identify its wearer as someone associated with the West; it came to symbolize the frontier.<ref>William Reynolds, and Rich Rand, ''The Cowboy Hat book'' (1995) p.&nbsp;10 {{ISBN|0-87905-656-8}}</ref> The most enduring fashion adapted from the cowboy, popular nearly worldwide today, are \"blue jeans\", originally made by [[Levi Strauss]] for miners in 1850.<ref>Howard R. Lamar (1977), p.&nbsp;272</ref>\n\nBefore a drive, a cowboy's duties included riding out on the range and bringing together the scattered cattle. The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying. While camping every night, cowboys would often sing to their herd to keep them calm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingstories.com/Stories/Why%20Cowboys%20Sing.pdf|title=Why Cowboys Sing?|publisher=Wyoming Stories|first=Wylie Grant|last=Sherwin}}</ref> The workdays often lasted fourteen hours, with just six hours of sleep. It was grueling, dusty work, with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day. On the trail, drinking, gambling, and brawling were often prohibited and fined, and sometimes cursing as well. It was monotonous and boring work, with food to match: bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried fruit, and potatoes. On average, cowboys earned $30 to $40 per month, because of the heavy physical and emotional toll, it was unusual for a cowboy to spend more than seven years on the range.<ref>Howard R.

Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Dodge City]], and [[Ellsworth, Kansas|Ellsworth]] experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became [[ghost town]]s and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued on after the grazing lands were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert R.|last=Dykstra|title=The Cattle Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t15L9AfXlPcC&pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6561-5}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation and environmentalism ==\n {{See also|Sagebrush Rebellion}}\n[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|1908 editorial cartoon of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] features his cowboy persona and his crusading for conservation.]]\n\nConcern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late 19th century, pitting different interests. On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum [[exploitation of natural resources]] to maximize jobs, economic growth, and their own profit.<ref>Char Miller, ''Gifford Pinchot and the making of modern environmentalism'' (2001) p.&nbsp;4</ref>\n\nIn the center were the [[conservation movement|conservationists]], led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his coalition of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with [[Gifford Pinchot]] and used the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230&nbsp;million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi{{sup|2}} or 930,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, [[national park]]s, and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.<ref>Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt explained his position in 1910:\n\n{{quote|Conservation means development as much as it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.<ref>W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003) p.&nbsp;25</ref>}}\n\nThe third element, smallest at first but growing rapidly after 1870, were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake, and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits. Their leader was [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914), a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake, and founder of the [[Sierra Club]]. Muir, based in California, in 1889 started organizing support to preserve the [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoias]] in the [[Yosemite Valley]]; Congress did pass the [[Yosemite National Park]] bill (1890). In 1897 President [[Grover Cleveland]] created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move. Muir, taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet,<ref>Dennis C. Williams, ''God's wilds: John Muir's vision of nature'' (2002) p.&nbsp;134</ref> crusaded against the lumberman, portraying it as a contest \"between landscape righteousness and the devil\".<ref>Robert L. Dorman, ''A word for nature: four pioneering environmental advocates, 1845\u20131913'' (1998) p.&nbsp;159</ref> A master publicist, Muir's magazine articles, in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (June 5, 1897) and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' turned the tide of public sentiment.<ref>John Muir, [http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=atla;idno=atla0080-2 \"The American Forests\"]</ref> He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt's program of setting aside national monuments, national forest reserves, and national parks. However Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President [[William Howard Taft]] on the [[Hetch Hetchy]] dam, which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco. Biographer [[Donald Worster]] says, \"Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Worster|title=A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuAsAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.

Once numbering over 25&nbsp;million on the [[Great Plains]], the grass-eating herds were a vital resource animal for the [[Plains Indians]], providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction. The last 10\u201315&nbsp;million died out in a decade 1872\u20131883; only 100 survived.<ref>M.

[[Conservation in the United States|Conservationists]] founded the [[American Bison Society]] in 1905; it lobbied Congress to establish public bison herds. Several national parks in the U.S. and Canada were created, in part to provide a sanctuary for bison and other large wildlife, with no hunting allowed.<ref>Glenn E.

During the same period, [[P. T. Barnum]] presented Indian chiefs, dances, and other Wild West exhibits in his museums. However, large scale awareness really took off when the [[dime novel]] appeared in 1859, the first being ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter''.<ref>Robert M. Utley (2003), p.&nbsp;253</ref> By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public's attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism, and fixed in the public's mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains\u2014courageous cowboys and savage Indians, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days. The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S. Ellis' ''Seth Jones'' (1860). [[Ned Buntline]]'s stories glamorized [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Edward Lytton Wheeler|Edward L. Wheeler]] created \"[[Deadwood Dick]]\", \"Hurricane Nell\", and \"Calamity Jane\".<ref>Howard R. Lamar (1977), pp.&nbsp;303\u2013304</ref>\n\nBuffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U.S. and Europe. He presented the first \"Wild West\" show in 1883, featuring a recreation of famous battles (especially Custer's Last Stand), expert marksmanship, and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and Indians, as well as sure-shooting [[Annie Oakley]].<ref>Joy S.

History professor William Weeks of the University of San Diego argues that in this \"New Western History\" approach:\n\n{{quote|It is easy to tell who the bad guys are \u2013 they are almost invariably white, male, and middle-class or better, while the good guys are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class....

The first group emphasizes human agency on the environment; the second looks at the influence of the environment. [[William Cronon]] has argued that Turner's famous 1893 essay was environmental history in an embryonic form. It emphasized the vast power of free land to attract and reshape settlers, making a transition from wilderness to civilization.<ref>Andrew C.

He compared the effects of the railroad opening up Western lands to urban transportation systems and the automobile, and Western settlers' \"land hunger\" to poor city residents seeking social status. Just as the Republican party benefited from support from \"old\" immigrant groups that settled on frontier farms, \"new\" urban immigrants formed an important part of the Democratic [[New Deal coalition]] that began with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s victory in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]].<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | last=Lubell|first=Samuel | year=1956 | pages=65\u201368, 82\u201383 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s an active center is the history department at the [[University of New Mexico]], along with the University of New Mexico Press.

The film was made with a production budget of $165 million, a record-breaking sum for an animated feature at the time.\n\n''The Polar Express'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] theaters on November 10, 2004. The film grossed $311.3 million worldwide, and was later listed in the 2006 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the first all-digital capture film. It also marks [[Michael Jeter]]'s last acting role before his death, and the film was thus dedicated to his memory.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Review: 'The Polar Express'|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|access-date=December 10, 2014|work=Variety|date=October 24, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226224253/http://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|archive-date=December 26, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], on the night of Christmas Eve, a boy becomes skeptical of the existence of Santa Claus. Struggling to fall asleep, he witnesses a steam locomotive arrive on the street, and goes outside to examine it. The conductor introduces the train as the Polar Express, bound for the North Pole. Initially reluctant, the boy jumps aboard as the train departs.\n\nIn a passenger car, he meets a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy. The train picks up a boy named Billy, who also declines to board, but changes his mind, and the boy applies the brakes to allow Billy to board, which is noticed by the conductor. As Billy sits alone in the train's [[observation car]], hot chocolate is served in the passenger car, and the girl stows away a cup for Billy. As she and the conductor cross to the dining car, the boy notices that she left her unpunched ticket, but loses hold of the ticket between the cars when he attempts to return it. The ticket reenters the passenger car, but not before the conductor notices its absence and escorts the girl back to the rear car.\n\nWhen the know-it-all claims the conductor will throw the girl from the train, the boy recovers the ticket and dashes to the dining car in search of the conductor, climbing onto the roof. He meets a hobo camping on the roof, who offers him coffee and discusses the existence of Santa Claus and ghosts. The hobo skis with the boy along the tops of the cars toward the [[tender (rail)|coal tender]], where the hobo disappears right at Flat Top Tunnel. In the locomotive's cab, the boy discovers that the girl has been made to supervise driving the train while the engineers Steamer and Smokey replace the headlight. The boy applies the brakes and the train stops coming across a herd of [[caribou]] blocking the tracks. The conductor pulls Smokey's beard, causing him to let out animal-like noises, and the caribou herd strolls away. The train continues on at extreme speed, and the throttle's [[split pin]] (cotter pin) shears off, causing the train to accelerate uncontrollably down a 179-degree grade and onto a frozen lake. Smokey uses his hairpin to repair the throttle as the train drifts across the ice to realign with the tracks moments before the ice breaks. The boy returns the girl's ticket for the conductor to punch, and as the three return to the passenger car, where the boy is taunted by an [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] [[Marionette|marionette puppet]] controlled by the hobo.\n\nThe train arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one of the passengers will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa himself. Discovering Billy still alone in the observation car, the girl and boy persuade him to come along, but the boy accidentally uncouples the car, sending it back along the line to a [[railway turntable]] in Santa's workshop. The children make their way through an elf command center and a gift sorting office before being dumped into a giant sack of presents, where they discover that the know-it-all has stowed away, and the elves escort them out as Santa arrives. A bell flies loose from the galloping reindeer's reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. He shows the bell to Santa, who selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas. Santa agrees to let him keep the bell, and the boy places it in his robe pocket.\n\nThe rear car is returned to the train as the children board to return home, but the boy discovers that he lost the bell through the hole in his pocket. He returns home and awakens Christmas morning to find a present containing the bell. He and his younger sister Sarah joyfully ring the bell, while their parents, not believing in Santa, lament that the bell is broken. The boy reflects on his friends and sister growing deaf to the bell as their belief faded. However, the bell still rings for him, as it will \"for all who truly believe\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michael Jeter at the 44th Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|175px|right|thumb|This film marks the final performance of actor [[Michael Jeter]]; Jeter died the year before the film's release.]]\n{{div col}}\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Hero Boy {{ref|mocap|I}}, Hero Boy's father, Conductor, Hobo, [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] puppet, Santa Claus, and the Narrator\n**[[Daryl Sabara]] as Hero Boy {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**[[Josh Hutcherson]] as Hero Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*Leslie Zemeckis as Sister Sarah {{ref|mocap|I}} and Hero Boy's mother\n**Isabella Peregrina as Sister Sarah {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**Ashly Holloway as Sister Sarah {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*[[Eddie Deezen]] as Know-It-All\n**[[Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak]] as Know-It-All {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*[[Nona Gaye]] as Hero Girl\n**Chantel Valdivieso as Hero Girl {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n**Meagan Moore as Hero Girl {{ref|singing|V}}\n**[[Tinashe]] as Hero Girl {{ref|model-mocap|III}}\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|mocap|I}}\n**Hayden McFarland as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n**[[Jimmy Bennett]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|voice|IV}}\n**[[Matthew Hall (actor)|Matthew Hall]] as Billy the Lonely Boy {{ref|singing|V}}\n*[[Dylan Cash]] as Boy on Train {{ref|voice|IV}}\n*Brendan King and Andy Pellick as Pastry Chefs\n*Josh Eli, Rolandas Hendricks, [[Jon Scott]], Sean Scott, Mark Mendonca, [[Mark Goodman]], Gregory Gast, and Gordon Hart as Waiters\n*[[Michael Jeter]] as Smokey and Steamer {{ref|mocap|I}}\n**[[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] as Smokey and Steamer {{ref|voice|IV}}\n*[[Chris Coppola]] as Gus the Toothless Boy and an Elf\n**Connor Matheus as Toothless Boy {{ref|ad-mocap|II}}\n*Julene Renee as Red Head Girl and an Elf\n*[[Phil Fondacaro]], [[Debbie Lee Carrington]], [[Mark Povinelli]], and Ed Gale as Elves\n*[[Charles Fleischer]] as Elf General\n*[[Steven Tyler]] as Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer\n{{div col end}}\n*{{note|mocap|}} '''I''' [[Motion-capture]] only, {{note|ad-mocap|}} '''II''' Additional motion-capture, {{note|model-mocap|}} '''III''' Motion-capture modeling, {{note|voice|}} '''IV''' Voice only, {{note|singing|}} '''V''' Singing voice only\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nHanks optioned the book in 1999 with the hopes of playing the conductor and Santa Claus.<ref name=riding>{{cite web |title=Riding the Polar Express |url=https://www.wired.com/2004/11/riding-the-polar-express/ |website=Wired |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref> One of the conditions of the sale was that the resulting film not be animated.

Co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], the film features human characters animated using live-action [[motion capture]] animation. The film tells the story of a young boy who, on [[Christmas Eve]], sees a mysterious train bound for the [[North Pole]] stop outside his window and is invited aboard by its conductor. The boy joins several other children as they embark on a journey to visit Santa Claus preparing for Christmas. The film stars [[Tom Hanks]], who was also one of the film's executive producers, in multiple distinct roles, with [[Daryl Sabara]], [[Nona Gaye]], [[Jimmy Bennett]] and [[Eddie Deezen]] in supporting roles. The film also includes a performance by [[Tinashe]] at age 9, as the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model for the female protagonist.\n\n[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] produced the film in association with [[Shangri-La Entertainment]], [[ImageMovers]], [[Playtone]] and Golden Mean Productions for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], as Castle Rock's first animated film. The visual effects and performance capture were done at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]. The film was made with a production budget of $165 million, a record-breaking sum for an animated feature at the time.\n\n''The Polar Express'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] theaters on November 10, 2004. The film grossed $311.3 million worldwide, and was later listed in the 2006 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the first all-digital capture film. It also marks [[Michael Jeter]]'s last acting role before his death, and the film was thus dedicated to his memory.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Review: 'The Polar Express'|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|access-date=December 10, 2014|work=Variety|date=October 24, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226224253/http://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|archive-date=December 26, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], on the night of Christmas Eve, a boy becomes skeptical of the existence of Santa Claus. Struggling to fall asleep, he witnesses a steam locomotive arrive on the street, and goes outside to examine it. The conductor introduces the train as the Polar Express, bound for the North Pole. Initially reluctant, the boy jumps aboard as the train departs.\n\nIn a passenger car, he meets a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy. The train picks up a boy named Billy, who also declines to board, but changes his mind, and the boy applies the brakes to allow Billy to board, which is noticed by the conductor. As Billy sits alone in the train's [[observation car]], hot chocolate is served in the passenger car, and the girl stows away a cup for Billy. As she and the conductor cross to the dining car, the boy notices that she left her unpunched ticket, but loses hold of the ticket between the cars when he attempts to return it. The ticket reenters the passenger car, but not before the conductor notices its absence and escorts the girl back to the rear car.\n\nWhen the know-it-all claims the conductor will throw the girl from the train, the boy recovers the ticket and dashes to the dining car in search of the conductor, climbing onto the roof. He meets a hobo camping on the roof, who offers him coffee and discusses the existence of Santa Claus and ghosts. The hobo skis with the boy along the tops of the cars toward the [[tender (rail)|coal tender]], where the hobo disappears right at Flat Top Tunnel. In the locomotive's cab, the boy discovers that the girl has been made to supervise driving the train while the engineers Steamer and Smokey replace the headlight. The boy applies the brakes and the train stops coming across a herd of [[caribou]] blocking the tracks. The conductor pulls Smokey's beard, causing him to let out animal-like noises, and the caribou herd strolls away. The train continues on at extreme speed, and the throttle's [[split pin]] (cotter pin) shears off, causing the train to accelerate uncontrollably down a 179-degree grade and onto a frozen lake. Smokey uses his hairpin to repair the throttle as the train drifts across the ice to realign with the tracks moments before the ice breaks. The boy returns the girl's ticket for the conductor to punch, and as the three return to the passenger car, where the boy is taunted by an [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] [[Marionette|marionette puppet]] controlled by the hobo.\n\nThe train arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one of the passengers will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa himself. Discovering Billy still alone in the observation car, the girl and boy persuade him to come along, but the boy accidentally uncouples the car, sending it back along the line to a [[railway turntable]] in Santa's workshop. The children make their way through an elf command center and a gift sorting office before being dumped into a giant sack of presents, where they discover that the know-it-all has stowed away, and the elves escort them out as Santa arrives. A bell flies loose from the galloping reindeer's reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. He shows the bell to Santa, who selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas. Santa agrees to let him keep the bell, and the boy places it in his robe pocket.\n\nThe rear car is returned to the train as the children board to return home, but the boy discovers that he lost the bell through the hole in his pocket. He returns home and awakens Christmas morning to find a present containing the bell.

The biennial prize, awarded to books on children, was recommended by a panel of judges. The ADL attempted to withdraw the prize ten days prior to the award ceremony, however after Lukas threatened he would file a lawsuit the ADL decided to reinstate it.

His specialty included the combat operations of the 8th, 12th and 15th air forces. \n\n===''Eagles East''===\nHis first book,  ''Eagles East, The United States and the Soviet Union, 1941-1945'' (1970), a  military-diplomatic study, earned him the national history award from the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]].<ref name=\"NA2016\" />\n\n===''The Strange Allies'' and ''Bitter Legacy''===\nLukas wrote scholarly books on Allied wartime and postwar relations. His book, ''The Strange Allies: Poland and the United States, 1941-1945'' (1978) studied in-depth the relationship between the United States and the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and highlighted the impact of [[Polish Americans|American Polonia]] in [[Poland\u2013United States relations|United States-Polish relations]]. The sequel to ''The Strange Allies'' was ''Bitter Legacy: Polish-American Relations in the Wake of World War II'' (1982), which dealt with postwar Polish history and Polish-American relations, as well as the aid that was extended to Poland after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"InPosterum\"/>\n\n===''The Forgotten Holocaust''===\n[[Norman Davies]] who wrote in the foreword of the 1997 and 2012 American editions of ''The Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under German Occupation, 1939-1944'' (1986) observed that over the years Lukas's work \u201crendered a valuable service by showing that no one can properly analyze the fate of one ethnic community in occupied Poland without referring to the fates of others.\u201d<ref>Norman Davies, Foreword, The Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under German Occupation, 1939-1944 (Rev. ed.; New York: Hippocrene Books, 1997), p. x.</ref> Davies also noted that \u201cby expanding the grounds for discussion and by pointing to aspects of the period that were indeed in danger of being forgotten, [the book] rendered a very real service.\"<ref>Norman Davies, Foreword, The Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under German Occupation, 1939-1944 (3d ed.; New York: Hippocrene Books, 2012), p. xi.</ref>\n\n[[John T.

The biennial prize, awarded to books on children, was recommended by a panel of judges. The ADL attempted to withdraw the prize ten days prior to the award ceremony, however after Lukas threatened he would file a lawsuit the ADL decided to reinstate it. According to the ADL the book \"strongly understated the level of anti-Semitism in Poland. It also strongly overstated the number of people who rescued Jews\".

Early explorers believed the ancient ruins to have been a Roman military camp, because of their size and numerous towers. Systematic archaeological excavations conducted since 1953 revealed that the site was, in fact, an Imperial palace. It was conceived and built by one of the [[Tetrarchs]], Emperor [[Galerius]], the adopted son and son-in-law of the great Emperor [[Diocletian]]. Galerius started construction in 298 (after a victory over the [[Sasanian Empire]] that brought him admiration and glory) to mark the place of his birth. The name Felix Romuliana was given in memory of his mother [[Romula]], who was also a priestess of a pagan cult. The complex of temples and palaces served three main purposes - a place of worship of his mother\u2019s divine personality, a monument to his deeds as emperor, and a luxurious villa for Galerius. Romuliana survived until it was plundered by the [[Huns]] in the mid 5th century. Later the site became a humble settlement of farmers and craftsmen, finally to be abandoned at the beginning of the 7th century with the arrival of the [[Slavs]].\n\nThe structures were first evaluated in 1835 by Baron von Herder, a Saxon mine entrepreneur, in the ''\"Bergm\u00e4nische Reise in Serbie im Jahre 1835\"''. Later the German mineralogist August Breithaupt also wrote an article about the constructions. The Austro-Hungarian naturalist, geographer, ethnographer and archaeologist [[Felix Philipp Kanitz]] (who has earned great respect in Serbia and Bulgaria through his works on the South Slavs) was especially interested in Gamzigrad and visited the ruins on two occasions, in 1860 and in 1864 when he drew the then condition of the ramparts and towers, included in his works on Serbia, printed in Vienna and Leipzig.<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\n<blockquote>\n''\u201cGamzigrad is one of the most magnificent monuments of the past...\u201d<br />...\u201cone of the largest and best preserved monuments of Roman architecture in Europe\u201d''\n -F. Kanitz<ref name=Gamzigrad/></blockquote>\n\nThe enthusiasm for Gamzigrad disappeared by the end of the 19th century. The real history of the complex was yet to be researched. The interest was revived in the 1950s during the period of \"Neo-romanticism of Serbian archaeology\". Vekoslav Popovic, Director of the Town Museum of Zajecar initiated the systematic archaeological research in 1953.\nThe academic professor Dr. [[Dragoslav Srejovic]] was in charge of the research in 1970, he is the one regarded as positioning the monument among world archaeology.<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\nThe complex was demystified in 1984, when in the south-west an archivolt with the inscription of <small>FELIX ROMULIANA</small> was discovered.<ref name=TPS>{{Google books |id=HAmc0fBGoxUC |title=Theory and Practice in Late Antique Archaeology }}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nThe construction started in 298 AD near the birthplace of [[Galerius]], the site was named ''Felix Romuliana'' after his mother, Romula. Galerius was of [[Thracian]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] stock, a descendant of tribes ruling parts of the Balkans prior to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC.\n\nArchaeological excavations on the site have unearthed the remains of a Roman compound with 2 temples, 2 palaces and a building with corridor including exceptionally fine [[mosaics]] depicting Greek gods [[Dionysos]] and [[Medusa]], figural capitals of [[Hercules]], baths and impressive gates. Several valuable hoards of Roman gold coins have been unearthed at the site, which continues to yield important Roman treasures and artifacts.\n\nPilasters of Emperors Diocletian, Maximian, Galerius, Licinius, Maximinus and Constantine are among spectacular finds. In the two mausolea on the Magura hill Romula and the founder Galerius were buried and deified.<ref name=TPS/>\n\nAmong the most important finds from the site are portraits of Roman emperors made from the [[Egypt]]ian purple stone called [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and coins that help to accurately date the complex. A sculpture of Diana, the goddess of hunt, was unearthed in July 2010 by German and Serbian archeology teams, experts said that horse and a rider is missing which symbolizes victory over the Barbarians.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.blic.rs/In-Focus/6688/Archeologists-found-sculpture-of-Diana-Goddess-of-hunt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724015930/http://english.blic.rs/In-Focus/6688/Archeologists-found-sculpture-of-Diana-Goddess-of-hunt |archive-date=2010-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlongside the Latin inscriptions throughout the complex, several Greek inscriptions are found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/gis?region=14|title=Epigraphy of Upper Danube|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151310/http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/gis?region=14|archive-date=9 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe northwestern part was renovated; basilicas were built, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian]]<ref name=\"Gamzigrad\"/>\n\n===Northern part===\n====Northern Temple====\nThe temple is of the ''tetrastile prostilos'' type, similar to the Jupiter temple at [[Diocletian Palace]] in [[Split (city)|Split]], built in 305 AD. The remains include a high podium, cross-shaped crypt, stairway and sacrificial altar. It was dedicated to [[Libera (mythology)|goddess Libera]]\n\nThe architrave, doorposts, podium and pillars were made of green sandstone, frieze of white limestone while the figural capitals were made of marble.<ref name=\"Gamzigrad\"/>\n\n====Palace One====\nThe palace consists of an octagonal core building, three [[Peristyle|peristiles]] and a smaller bathroom. The vestibulum (accessory hall) is preserved with marble plate and pillars of green serpent brecha and red granite. The floor of the vestibulum is completely covered by a mosaic carpet with a labyrinth in its center and geometric motifs.\n\nThe central hall (possible throne) is ornamented with geometrics and picturesque hunting scenes.\n\nThe triclinum is ornamented with precious colorful stone tiles (opus sectile) and the entrance is ornamented with a luxurious mosaic with the image of the Greek god [[Dionysus]]. Parts of a sculpture of Galerius depicted as [[Pantocrator]] (ruler of Universe) have been found throughout the buildings, a left hand holding a globe of red porphyry was found in the triclinum, the head was found in the south-east of the complex.\n\nThe Palace walls are covered with marble, green porphyry and frescoes. The marble sculptures depicting the Greek gods are made according to 5th and 4th century BC sculptural art.\n\nThe capitals of the pillars of the peristiles in the atrium with a fountain were made of white marble taken from the island of [[Marmara Island|Proconesos]]. The walls of a polygonal room had the plates made of green porphyry from [[Peloponnesus]].<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\n====Palace Two====\nThe second palace and a building with a corridor has only been partially researched.\n\nA rectangular peristile in the center is surrounded by premises of different sizes and functions.<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\n===Grand Temple===\nThe Grand Temple dominates the south of the compound.<ref name=\"Gamzigrad\"/> The podium in the temple and the basis of a large stairway are well preserved while the walls of the cella are only partly preserved. The remains of an altar with a narrow stairway were found in front of the temple. There is a double crypt in the podium of the temple: a wall directed towards east and west divides the crypt into two rooms with the rectangular basis. A very narrow stairway starting from the southeastern corner of the cella led to the crypt. The cella is rectangular with the antas forming a shallow vestibule.\n\nThe walls and floor of the cella have the layer of marble plates. According to the fragments of architectonic elements, we can assume that the temple had two colonnades of columns: a higher one with the Corinthian columns and a lower one with the Ionian columns. In the very vicinity of the temple a great number of fragments of sculptures was found \u2013 they were made of white marble, the most important of which were the heads of Jupiter and Hercules (Photos 20 & 21) according to which the purpose of the temple could be defined. The founder Tetrarchius, Diocletian identified himself with Jupiter while his adopted son and co-ruler Galerius on entering the divine Jupiter family took Hercules for his patron. That\u2019s how the tradition for the rulers to be named after Jupiter and Hercules was established as well as to celebrate the annual holiday in their honor (Ioni et Herculi) on the day when the augusti identified themselves with Jupiter and caesari with Hercules \u2013 the day which became their common and genuine birthday (geminus natalis).

Early explorers believed the ancient ruins to have been a Roman military camp, because of their size and numerous towers. Systematic archaeological excavations conducted since 1953 revealed that the site was, in fact, an Imperial palace. It was conceived and built by one of the [[Tetrarchs]], Emperor [[Galerius]], the adopted son and son-in-law of the great Emperor [[Diocletian]]. Galerius started construction in 298 (after a victory over the [[Sasanian Empire]] that brought him admiration and glory) to mark the place of his birth. The name Felix Romuliana was given in memory of his mother [[Romula]], who was also a priestess of a pagan cult. The complex of temples and palaces served three main purposes - a place of worship of his mother\u2019s divine personality, a monument to his deeds as emperor, and a luxurious villa for Galerius. Romuliana survived until it was plundered by the [[Huns]] in the mid 5th century. Later the site became a humble settlement of farmers and craftsmen, finally to be abandoned at the beginning of the 7th century with the arrival of the [[Slavs]].\n\nThe structures were first evaluated in 1835 by Baron von Herder, a Saxon mine entrepreneur, in the ''\"Bergm\u00e4nische Reise in Serbie im Jahre 1835\"''. Later the German mineralogist August Breithaupt also wrote an article about the constructions. The Austro-Hungarian naturalist, geographer, ethnographer and archaeologist [[Felix Philipp Kanitz]] (who has earned great respect in Serbia and Bulgaria through his works on the South Slavs) was especially interested in Gamzigrad and visited the ruins on two occasions, in 1860 and in 1864 when he drew the then condition of the ramparts and towers, included in his works on Serbia, printed in Vienna and Leipzig.<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\n<blockquote>\n''\u201cGamzigrad is one of the most magnificent monuments of the past...\u201d<br />...\u201cone of the largest and best preserved monuments of Roman architecture in Europe\u201d''\n -F. Kanitz<ref name=Gamzigrad/></blockquote>\n\nThe enthusiasm for Gamzigrad disappeared by the end of the 19th century. The real history of the complex was yet to be researched. The interest was revived in the 1950s during the period of \"Neo-romanticism of Serbian archaeology\". Vekoslav Popovic, Director of the Town Museum of Zajecar initiated the systematic archaeological research in 1953.\nThe academic professor Dr. [[Dragoslav Srejovic]] was in charge of the research in 1970, he is the one regarded as positioning the monument among world archaeology.<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\nThe complex was demystified in 1984, when in the south-west an archivolt with the inscription of <small>FELIX ROMULIANA</small> was discovered.<ref name=TPS>{{Google books |id=HAmc0fBGoxUC |title=Theory and Practice in Late Antique Archaeology }}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nThe construction started in 298 AD near the birthplace of [[Galerius]], the site was named ''Felix Romuliana'' after his mother, Romula. Galerius was of [[Thracian]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] stock, a descendant of tribes ruling parts of the Balkans prior to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC.\n\nArchaeological excavations on the site have unearthed the remains of a Roman compound with 2 temples, 2 palaces and a building with corridor including exceptionally fine [[mosaics]] depicting Greek gods [[Dionysos]] and [[Medusa]], figural capitals of [[Hercules]], baths and impressive gates. Several valuable hoards of Roman gold coins have been unearthed at the site, which continues to yield important Roman treasures and artifacts.\n\nPilasters of Emperors Diocletian, Maximian, Galerius, Licinius, Maximinus and Constantine are among spectacular finds. In the two mausolea on the Magura hill Romula and the founder Galerius were buried and deified.<ref name=TPS/>\n\nAmong the most important finds from the site are portraits of Roman emperors made from the [[Egypt]]ian purple stone called [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and coins that help to accurately date the complex. A sculpture of Diana, the goddess of hunt, was unearthed in July 2010 by German and Serbian archeology teams, experts said that horse and a rider is missing which symbolizes victory over the Barbarians.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.blic.rs/In-Focus/6688/Archeologists-found-sculpture-of-Diana-Goddess-of-hunt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724015930/http://english.blic.rs/In-Focus/6688/Archeologists-found-sculpture-of-Diana-Goddess-of-hunt |archive-date=2010-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlongside the Latin inscriptions throughout the complex, several Greek inscriptions are found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/gis?region=14|title=Epigraphy of Upper Danube|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151310/http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/gis?region=14|archive-date=9 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe northwestern part was renovated; basilicas were built, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian]]<ref name=\"Gamzigrad\"/>\n\n===Northern part===\n====Northern Temple====\nThe temple is of the ''tetrastile prostilos'' type, similar to the Jupiter temple at [[Diocletian Palace]] in [[Split (city)|Split]], built in 305 AD. The remains include a high podium, cross-shaped crypt, stairway and sacrificial altar. It was dedicated to [[Libera (mythology)|goddess Libera]]\n\nThe architrave, doorposts, podium and pillars were made of green sandstone, frieze of white limestone while the figural capitals were made of marble.<ref name=\"Gamzigrad\"/>\n\n====Palace 1====\nThe palace consists of an octagonal core building, three [[Peristyle|peristiles]] and a smaller bathroom. The vestibulum (accessory hall) is preserved with marble plate and pillars of green serpent brecha and red granite. The floor of the vestibulum is completely covered by a mosaic carpet with a labyrinth in its center and geometric motifs.\n\nThe central hall (possible throne) is ornamented with geometrics and picturesque hunting scenes.\n\nThe triclinum is ornamented with precious colorful stone tiles (opus sectile) and the entrance is ornamented with a luxurious mosaic with the image of the Greek god [[Dionysus]]. Parts of a sculpture of Galerius depicted as [[Pantocrator]] (ruler of Universe) have been found throughout the buildings, a left hand holding a globe of red porphyry was found in the triclinum, the head was found in the south-east of the complex.\n\nThe Palace walls are covered with marble, green porphyry and frescoes. The marble sculptures depicting the Greek gods are made according to 5th and 4th century BC sculptural art.\n\nThe capitals of the pillars of the peristiles in the atrium with a fountain were made of white marble taken from the island of [[Marmara Island|Proconesos]]. The walls of a polygonal room had the plates made of green porphyry from [[Peloponnesus]].<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\n====Palace Two====\nThe second palace and a building with a corridor has only been partially researched.\n\nA rectangular peristile in the center is surrounded by premises of different sizes and functions.<ref name=Gamzigrad/>\n\n===Grand Temple===\nThe Grand Temple dominates the south of the compound.<ref name=\"Gamzigrad\"/> The podium in the temple and the basis of a large stairway are well preserved while the walls of the cella are only partly preserved. The remains of an altar with a narrow stairway were found in front of the temple. There is a double crypt in the podium of the temple: a wall directed towards east and west divides the crypt into two rooms with the rectangular basis. A very narrow stairway starting from the southeastern corner of the cella led to the crypt. The cella is rectangular with the antas forming a shallow vestibule.\n\nThe walls and floor of the cella have the layer of marble plates. According to the fragments of architectonic elements, we can assume that the temple had two colonnades of columns: a higher one with the Corinthian columns and a lower one with the Ionian columns. In the very vicinity of the temple a great number of fragments of sculptures was found \u2013 they were made of white marble, the most important of which were the heads of Jupiter and Hercules (Photos 20 & 21) according to which the purpose of the temple could be defined. The founder Tetrarchius, Diocletian identified himself with Jupiter while his adopted son and co-ruler Galerius on entering the divine Jupiter family took Hercules for his patron. That\u2019s how the tradition for the rulers to be named after Jupiter and Hercules was established as well as to celebrate the annual holiday in their honor (Ioni et Herculi) on the day when the augusti identified themselves with Jupiter and caesari with Hercules \u2013 the day which became their common and genuine birthday (geminus natalis). It is certain that the temple dominating Romuliana was dedicated to those Gods, i.e. to the cult of the rulers identified with them. It is, above all, Galerius himself who was honored as Divus Galerius after death and apotheosis.\n\n==Preservation and tourism==\nDuring the 31st Session of the [[Unesco World Heritage]] Committee in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] from the 23rd of June to the second of July 2007, The World Heritage Committee decided to place Gamzigrad-Romuliana, Palace of Galerius on the World Heritage List.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070701093650/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D38732%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html]\n\nFelix Romuliana is a popular tourist stop on the [[Roman Emperors Route|Roman Emperors' trail]] which links the birthplaces of over 17 Roman Emperors born on the territory of modern [[Serbia]].\n\n==Roman Emperors==\nThree Roman Emperors were born in this municipality (modern [[Zaje\u010dar]], [[Serbia]])\n\n*[[Galerius]] ruled 293-311\n*[[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] ruled 305-312\n*[[Licinius]] ruled 308-324\n\n==Spa resort==\nA modern-day spa resort, Gamzigradska Banja, is located nearby with a \"special rehabilitation hospital\".<ref>[http://www.visitserbia.org/english/english/destinations/by_regions/eastern_serbia/3083-gamzigrad_spa.html Gamzigrad Spa], VisitSerbia.org</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFelix Romuliana.jpg|The gate area\nGamzigrad.jpg|Mosaic of Greek god [[Dionysus]]\nGamzigrad - Felix Romuliana (by Pudelek) 5 - East Gate.JPG|Ruins of East Gate\nRomuliana Galerius head.jpg|Head of [[Galerius]], found on the site\nPlan Gamzigrad-Romuliana, palais de Gal\u00e8re.svg|Plan\nFile:Gamzigrad-Romuliana, Palace of Galerius-122721.jpg|ruins of palace with mosaic floor\nGamzigrad-Romuliana, Palace of Galerius-122720.jpg|Detail of mosaic\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Gamzigrad}}\n* [[Roman Serbia]]\n* [[Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gamzigrad.com Gamzigrad - Felix Romuliana portal]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHLoBCaaTE8 Felix Romuliana] on [[YouTube]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091214024022/http://zvezdan.hpage.com/felix_romuliana_45958097.html Zvezdan.hpage - Felix Romuliana]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=h&msa=0&msid=102024419633429989387.00044e3b00d5ed2e80084&ll=43.899265,22.185414&spn=0.00218,0.005048&z=18&iwloc=000494a2daa100ae2cecd Site of Felix Romuliana in Google Maps]\n\n{{Cultural Heritage of Exceptional Importance}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Serbia}}\n{{National symbols of Serbia}}\n{{Castles, fortresses and palaces in Serbia|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:298 establishments]]\n[[Category:290s establishments in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance]]\n[[Category:Galerius]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in the 3rd century]]\n[[Category:Populated places disestablished in the 7th century]]\n[[Category:Roman Dacia]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Serbia]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Serbia]]\n\n[[de:Galerius-Palast]]\n", "name_user": "The Emperor of Byzantium", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePalace 1", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamzigrad"}

Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\n\nThe parents of 12-year-old D.J. Walters go away for the weekend, leaving him in the care of his negligent babysitter Zee. D.J. has been spying on his elderly neighbor Mr. Horace Nebbercracker, who scares away children and confiscates their belongings that land in his front yard. After D.J.'s best friend Chowder loses his basketball on Nebbercracker's lawn, D.J. is caught attempting to retrieve it, but the enraged Nebbercracker suffers a heart attack and is taken away by ambulance. That night, D.J. gets phone calls from the house with no one there and eavesdrops on Zee's boyfriend Bones, who tells her about losing his kite on Nebbercracker's lawn when he was ten and that Nebbercracker supposedly ate his wife.\n\nLater, Bones sees his lost kite in the house's front door, but is suddenly devoured by the house while attempting to retrieve it. D.J. meets up with Chowder and the two investigate, but retreat when the house comes to life and attacks them. The next morning, schoolgirl Jenny Bennett sells Halloween candy and goes to the house; D.J. and Chowder rush out to save her before she gets eaten. Jenny promptly calls police officers Landers and Lister, who unfortunately do not believe the trio because the house is inactive when adults are present.\n\nThe trio then consult local video gamer Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski, supposedly an expert on the supernatural. They learn from him that the house is a rare monster created when a human soul merges with a man-made structure and that it can only be killed by destroying its heart. Concluding the heart must be the furnace, the trio create and bring a dummy containing cold medicine taken from Chowder's father's pharmacy to the house. Before the dummy reaches the house however, Landers and Lister return, thwart their plan and arrest them after Landers discovers the stolen medicine inside the dummy. The house eats the two officers and their police car where D.J., Chowder and Jenny have been shut.\n\nAfter the house falls asleep, the three begin exploring. In the basement, they find toys accumulated from Nebbercracker's lawn as well as a door opening to a shrine containing the encased-in-cement body of Nebbercracker's late wife, Constance the Giantess. The house becomes aware of their presence and attacks them, though they force it to vomit them outside by grabbing its uvula. Nebbercracker returns alive, revealing that Constance's spirit is within the house and that, instead of eating her, he had given her the happiest times in her life. As a young man, he met Constance, then an unwilling member of a circus freak show, and fell in love with her despite her obesity. One Halloween, as children tormented her due to her size, Constance tried chasing them away but lost her footing and fell to her death in the unfinished basement. Nebbercracker had finished building the house, knowing it was what she would have wanted. Aware that Constance's spirit made the house come alive, however, he pretended to hate children in order to protect them.\n\nD.J. convinces Nebbercracker to let Constance go, much to the house's anger. It breaks free from its foundation and chases the group to a construction site. Nebbercracker realizes the recent trouble Constance caused and attempts to blow the house up with dynamite, but it attacks him. As Chowder fights off the house with an excavator, D.J. and Jenny climb to the top of a crane and D.J. throws the dynamite given to him by Nebbercracker into the house's chimney, causing it to explode and release Constance's ghost. D.J. apologizes to Nebbercracker for his losses, but Nebbercracker thanks the trio for freeing him and his wife from being trapped for 45 years. Later that night, children in their Halloween costumes line up at the site of the house where Nebbercracker, D.J., Chowder and Jenny return their toys to them. After Jenny's mother picks her up and D.J.'s parents return, Chowder and D.J. go trick-or-treating, which they earlier felt they were too old for. Those who were eaten by the house emerge from the basement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Samlerner spencerlocke mitchelmusso.jpg|thumb|[[Sam Lerner]], [[Spencer Locke]] and [[Mitchel Musso]] at the [[34th Annie Awards]].]]\n* [[Mitchel Musso]] as Dustin Jay \"D.J.\" Walters\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as Charles \"Chowder\"\n* [[Spencer Locke]] as Jennifer \"Jenny\" Bennett\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Horace Nebbercracker\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Elizabeth \"Zee\" \n* [[Kevin James]] as Police Officer Landers\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Police Officer Lister\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Bones\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Mrs. Walters\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Walters\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Constance Nebbercracker, Horace's wife\n* [[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]] as Eliza, a six-year-old who trespasses on Nebbercracker's lawn\n\n==Production==\nThe film was initially set up at [[DreamWorks Animation]], based on a pitch by newcomer [[Gil Kenan]].

Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\n\nThe parents of 12-year-old D.J. Walters go away for the weekend, leaving him in the care of his negligent babysitter Zee. D.J. has been spying on his elderly neighbor Mr. Horace Nebbercracker, who scares away children and confiscates their belongings that land in his front yard. After D.J.'s best friend Chowder loses his basketball on Nebbercracker's lawn, D.J. is caught attempting to retrieve it, but the enraged Nebbercracker suffers a heart attack and is taken away by ambulance. That night, D.J. gets phone calls from the house with no one there and eavesdrops on Zee's boyfriend Bones, who tells her about losing his kite on Nebbercracker's lawn when he was ten and that Nebbercracker supposedly ate his wife.\n\nLater, Bones sees his lost kite in the house's front door, but is suddenly devoured by the house while attempting to retrieve it. D.J. meets up with Chowder and the two investigate, but retreat when the house comes to life and attacks them. The next morning, schoolgirl Jenny Bennett sells Halloween candy and goes to the house; D.J. and Chowder rush out to save her before she gets eaten. Jenny promptly calls police officers Landers and Lister, who unfortunately do not believe the trio because the house is inactive when adults are present.\n\nThe trio then consult local video gamer Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski, supposedly an expert on the supernatural. They learn from him that the house is a rare monster created when a human soul merges with a man-made structure and that it can only be killed by destroying its heart. Concluding the heart must be the furnace, the trio create and bring a dummy containing cold medicine taken from Chowder's father's pharmacy to the house. Before the dummy reaches the house however, Landers and Lister return, thwart their plan and arrest them after Landers discovers the stolen medicine inside the dummy. The house eats the two officers and their police car where D.J., Chowder and Jenny have been shut.\n\nAfter the house falls asleep, the three begin exploring. In the basement, they find toys accumulated from Nebbercracker's lawn as well as a door opening to a shrine containing the encased-in-cement body of Nebbercracker's late wife, Constance the Giantess. The house becomes aware of their presence and attacks them, though they force it to vomit them outside by grabbing its uvula. Nebbercracker returns alive, revealing that Constance's spirit is within the house and that, instead of eating her, he had given her the happiest times in her life. As a young man, he met Constance, then an unwilling member of a circus freak show, and fell in love with her despite her obesity. One Halloween, as children tormented her due to her size, Constance tried chasing them away but lost her footing and fell to her death in the unfinished basement. Nebbercracker had finished building the house, knowing it was what she would have wanted. Aware that Constance's spirit made the house come alive, however, he pretended to hate children in order to protect them.\n\nD.J. convinces Nebbercracker to let Constance go, much to the house's anger. It breaks free from its foundation and chases the group to a construction site. Nebbercracker realizes the recent trouble Constance caused and attempts to blow the house up with dynamite, but it attacks him. As Chowder fights off the house with an excavator, D.J. and Jenny climb to the top of a crane and D.J. throws the dynamite given to him by Nebbercracker into the house's chimney, causing it to explode and release Constance's ghost. D.J. apologizes to Nebbercracker for his losses, but Nebbercracker thanks the trio for freeing him and his wife from being trapped for 45 years. Later that night, children in their Halloween costumes line up at the site of the house where Nebbercracker, D.J., Chowder and Jenny return their toys to them. After Jenny's mother picks her up and D.J.'s parents return, Chowder and D.J. go trick-or-treating, which they earlier felt they were too old for. Those who were eaten by the house emerge from the basement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Samlerner spencerlocke mitchelmusso.jpg|thumb|[[Sam Lerner]], [[Spencer Locke]] and [[Mitchel Musso]] at the [[34th Annie Awards]].]]\n* [[Mitchel Musso]] as Dustin Jay \"D.J.\" Walters\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as Charles \"Chowder\"\n* [[Spencer Locke]] as Jennifer \"Jenny\" Bennett\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Horace Nebbercracker\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Elizabeth \"Zee\" \n* [[Kevin James]] as Police Officer Landers\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Police Officer Lister\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Bones\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Mrs. Walters\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Walters\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Constance Nebbercracker, Horace's wife\n* [[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]] as Eliza, a six-year-old who trespasses on Nebbercracker's lawn\n\n==Production==\nThe film was initially set up at [[DreamWorks Animation]], based on a pitch by newcomer [[Gil Kenan]].
