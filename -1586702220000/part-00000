However, it does [[Comparison of Standard Malay and Indonesian|differ]] from Malaysian Malay in several respects, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. These differences are due mainly to the Dutch and Javanese influences on Indonesian. Indonesian was also influenced by the {{lang|id|Melayu pasar}} (literally \"market Malay\"), which was the lingua franca of the archipelago in colonial times, and thus indirectly by other spoken languages of the islands.\n\nMalaysian Malay claims to be closer to the classical Malay of earlier centuries, even though modern Malaysian has been heavily influenced, in lexicon as well as in syntax, by English. The question of whether High Malay (Court Malay) or Low Malay (Bazaar Malay) was the true parent of the Indonesian language is still in debate. High Malay was the official language used in the court of the [[Johor Sultanate]] and continued by the Dutch-administered territory of [[Riau-Lingga]], while Low Malay was commonly used in marketplaces and ports of the archipelago. Some linguists have argued that it was the more common Low Malay that formed the base of the Indonesian language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1626/bahasa-indonesia-memasyarakatkan-kembali-bahasa-pasar |title=Bahasa Indonesia: Memasyarakatkan Kembali 'Bahasa Pasar'? |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=29 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630131527/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1626/bahasa-indonesia-memasyarakatkan-kembali-bahasa-pasar |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Dutch colonial era ===\nWhen the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) first arrived in the archipelago, the Malay language was a significant trading and political language due to the influence of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malaccan Sultanate]] and later the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. However, the language had never been dominant among the population of the Indonesian archipelago as it was limited to mercantile activity. The VOC adopted the Malay language as the administrative language of their trading outpost in the east. Following the [[bankruptcy]] of the VOC, the [[Batavian Republic]] took control of the colony in 1799, and it was only then that education in and promotion of Dutch began in the [[colony]]. Even then, Dutch administrators were remarkably reluctant to promote the use of Dutch compared to other colonial regimes. Dutch thus remained the language of a small elite: in 1940, only 2% of the total population could speak Dutch. Nevertheless, it did have a significant influence on the development of Malay in the colony: during the colonial era, the language that would be standardised as Indonesian absorbed a large amount of Dutch vocabulary in the form of [[loanwords]].\n\n=== Birth of the Indonesian language ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Opening van de Volksraad door gouverneur-generaal Van Limburg Stirum op 18 mei 1918 op Java TMnr 10001373.jpg|thumb|''[[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]]'' session held in July 1938 in Jakarta, where Indonesian was formally used for the first time by Jahja Datoek Kajo.]]\n\nThe [[Indonesian National Awakening|nationalist movement]] that ultimately brought Indonesian to its national language status rejected [[Dutch language|Dutch]] from the outset. However, the rapid disappearance of Dutch was a very unusual case compared with other colonised countries, where the colonial language generally has continued to function as the language of politics, [[bureaucracy]], education, [[technology]], and other fields of importance for a significant time after independence.<ref name=\"Swaan\"/> Soenjono Dardjowidjojo even goes so far as to say that \"Indonesian is perhaps the only language that has achieved the status of a national language in its true sense\"{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} since it truly dominates in all spheres of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian society]]. The ease with which Indonesia eliminated the language of its former colonial power can perhaps be explained as much by Dutch [[policy]] as by Indonesian nationalism. In marked contrast to the [[France|French]], [[Spain|Spanish]] and Portuguese, who pursued an [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] colonial policy, or even the [[British Empire|British]], the Dutch did not attempt to spread their language among the indigenous population. In fact, they consciously prevented the language from being spread by refusing to provide education, especially in Dutch, to the native Indonesians so they would not come to see themselves as equals.<ref name=\"Swaan\"/> Moreover, the Dutch wished to prevent the Indonesians from elevating their perceived social status by taking on elements of Dutch culture. Thus, until the 1930s, they maintained a minimalist regime and allowed Malay to spread quickly throughout the archipelago.\n\nDutch dominance at that time covered nearly all aspects, with official forums requiring the use of Dutch, although since the Second Youth Congress (1928) the use of Indonesian as the national language was agreed on as one of the tools in the independence struggle. As of it, [[Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin]] inveighed actions underestimating Indonesian. After some criticism and protests, the use of Indonesian was allowed since the ''Volksraad'' sessions held in July 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html|title=The Indonesian Language \u2013 Bahasa Indonesia|date=8 May 2005|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508115242/http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html|archivedate=8 May 2005}}</ref> By the time they tried to counter the spread of Malay by teaching Dutch to the natives, it was too late, and in 1942, the Japanese conquered Indonesia and outlawed the use of the Dutch language. Three years later, the Indonesians themselves formally abolished the language and established ''Bahasa Indonesia'' as the national language of the new nation.<ref name=\"Paauw\"/> The term ''Bahasa Indonesia'' itself had been proposed by [[Mohammad Tabrani]] in 1926,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Government of Jakarta |title=Mohammad Tabrani |url=https://jakarta.go.id/artikel/konten/2486/mohammad-tabrani |accessdate=27 November 2019 |language=id |date=2017|ref=harv}}</ref> and Tabrani had further proposed the term over calling the language [[Malay language]] during the First Youth Congress in 1926.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Leitner |first1=Gerhard |last2=Hashim |first2=Azirah |last3=Wolf |first3=Hans-Georg |title=Communicating with Asia: The Future of English as a Global Language |date=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-47296-5 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t7OnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA180 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Adoption as national language ===\n[[File:Youthpledge.jpg|thumb|''The Pledge'' was the result of second [[Youth Pledge]] held in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in October 1928. On the last pledge, there was an affirmation of Indonesian language as a ''unifying language'' throughout the archipelago.]]\n\nThe adoption of Indonesian as the country's national language was in contrast to most other post-colonial states. Neither the language with the most native speakers (Javanese) nor the language of the former European colonial power (Dutch) was to be adopted. Instead, a local language with far fewer native speakers than the most widely spoken local language was chosen (nevertheless, Malay was the second most widely spoken language in the colony after Javanese, and had many L2 speakers using it for trade, administration, and education).\n\nIn 1945, when Indonesia declared its independence, Indonesian was formally declared the national language,<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Indonesian Language |publisher=Language Translation, Inc. |url=http://www.languagetranslation.com/translation/languages/indonesian-translation4.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043125/http://www.languagetranslation.com/translation/languages/indonesian-translation4.html |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref> despite being the native language of only about 5% of the population.

It was the native language of nearly half the population, the primary language of politics and [[economics]], and the language of [[court]]ly, [[religion|religious]], and literary tradition.<ref name=\"Swaan\">{{cite book |last1=de Swaan |first1=Abram |title=Words of the World |date=2001 |publisher=Polity |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0745627489 |pages=81\u201395 }}</ref> What it lacked, however, was the ability to unite the diverse Indonesian population as a whole. With thousands of islands and hundreds of different languages, the newly independent country of Indonesia had to find a national language that could realistically be spoken by the majority of the population and that would not divide the nation by favouring one ethnic group, namely the Javanese, over the others. In 1945, Indonesian was already in widespread use;<ref name=Kratz/> in fact, it had been for roughly a thousand years. Over that long period, Malay, which would later become standardised as Indonesian, was the primary language of [[commerce]] and [[travel]]. It was also the language used for the propagation of [[Islam]] in the 13th to 17th centuries, as well as the language of instruction used by Portuguese and Dutch missionaries attempting to convert the indigenous people to [[Christianity]].<ref name=Swaan/> The combination of these factors meant that the language was already known to some degree by most of the population, and it could be more easily adopted as the national language than perhaps any other. Moreover, it was the language of the sultanate of [[Brunei]] and of future [[Malaysia]], on which [[Greater Indonesia|some Indonesian nationalists had claims]].\n\nOver the first 53 years of [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], the country's first two presidents, [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] constantly nurtured the sense of national unity embodied by Indonesian, and the language remains an essential component of Indonesian identity. Through a language planning program that made Indonesian the language of [[politics]], [[education]], and nation-building in general, Indonesian became one of the few success stories of an [[indigenous language]] effectively overtaking that of a country's colonisers to become the ''[[de jure]]'' and ''[[de facto]]'' official language.<ref name=\"Paauw\">{{cite journal|last1=Paauw|first1=Scott|title=One Land, One Nation, One Language: An Analysis of Indonesia's National Language Policy|journal=University of Rochester Working Papers in the Language Sciences|date=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=2\u201316|url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/cls/assets/pdf/working/Paauw.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218024007/http://www.rochester.edu/college/cls/assets/pdf/working/Paauw.pdf|archive-date=18 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, Indonesian continues to function as the language of [[national identity]] as the Congress of Indonesian Youth envisioned, and also serves as the language of education, [[literacy]], [[modernization theory|modernisation]], and [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"Paauw\" /> Despite still being a second language to most Indonesians, it is unquestionably the language of the Indonesian nation as a whole, as it has had unrivalled success as a factor in nation-building and the strengthening of Indonesian identity.\n\n=== Modern and colloquial Indonesian ===\n{{further|Indonesian slang}}\n[[File:Sukarno hatta airport - Terminal - Jakarta - Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|Road-signs in an airport terminal]]\n[[File:Kuta Bali Indonesia Tol-Station-Nusa-Dua-01.jpg|thumb|Toll gate in Indonesia]]\n[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Bus-stop-Monumen-Nasional-02.jpg|thumb|right|Indonesian language used on a bus advertisement]]\n\nWhile Indonesian is spoken as a [[mother tongue]] by only a small proportion of the population (i.e. mainly those who reside within the vicinity of [[Jakarta]] and other large predominantly Indonesian-speaking cities such as [[Medan]] and [[Balikpapan]]), over 200 million people regularly make use of the national language, with varying degrees of proficiency. In a nation that boasts more than 700 native languages and a vast array of ethnic groups, it plays an important unifying and cross-archipelagic role for the country. Use of the national language is abundant in the media, [[government]] bodies, [[school]]s, [[University|universities]], [[workplace]]s, among members of the upper-class or nobility and also in formal situations, despite the 2010 census showing only 19.94% of over-five-year-olds speak mainly Indonesian at home.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/kewarganegaraan%20penduduk%20indonesia/index.html | title=Publication Name | access-date=4 December 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710134114/http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/kewarganegaraan%20penduduk%20indonesia/index.html | archive-date=10 July 2017 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nStandard Indonesian is used in books and newspapers and on television/radio news broadcasts. The standard dialect, however, is rarely used in daily conversations, being confined mostly to formal settings. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to its written standards), the proximity of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) to its normative form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to Indonesians combining aspects of their own local languages (e.g., [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and  [[Balinese language|Balinese]]) with Indonesian. This results in various vernacular varieties of Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is amplified by the use of [[Indonesian slang]], particularly in the cities. Unlike the relatively uniform standard variety, Vernacular Indonesian exhibits a high degree of geographical variation, though Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian functions as the ''de facto'' norm of informal language and is a popular source of influence throughout the archipelago.<ref name=:0 />\n\nThe most common and widely used colloquial Indonesian is heavily influenced by the [[Betawi language]], a [[Malay trade and creole languages|Malay-based creole]] of [[Jakarta]], amplified by its popularity in Indonesian popular culture in mass media and Jakarta's status as the national capital. In informal spoken Indonesian, various words are replaced with those of a less formal nature. For example, {{lang|id|tidak}} (no) is often replaced with the Betawi form {{lang|id|nggak}} or the even simpler {{lang|id|gak}}, while {{lang|id|seperti}} (like, similar to) is often replaced with {{lang|jv|kayak}} {{IPA-ms|kaja\u0294|}}. {{lang|id|Sangat}} or {{lang|id|amat}} (very), the term to express intensity, is often being replaced with the Javanese-influenced {{lang|id|banget}}.\n\nAs for pronunciation, the diphthongs ''ai'' and ''au'' on the end of base words are typically pronounced as {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. In informal writing, the spelling of words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation in a way that can be produced with less effort. For example, {{lang|id|capai}} becomes {{lang|id|cape}} or {{lang|id|capek}}, {{lang|id|pakai}} becomes {{lang|id|pake}}, {{lang|id|kalau}} becomes {{lang|id|kalo}}.\n\nIn verbs, the prefix ''me-'' is often dropped, although an initial nasal consonant is often retained, as when {{lang|id|mengangkat}} becomes {{lang|id|ngangkat}} (the basic word is {{lang|id|angkat}}). The suffixes ''-kan'' and ''-i'' are often replaced by ''-in''. For example, {{lang|id|mencarikan}} becomes {{lang|id|nyariin}}, {{lang|id|menuruti}} becomes {{lang|id|nurutin}}. The latter grammatical aspect is one often closely related to the Indonesian spoken in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.\n\n== Classification and related languages ==\n{{See also|Austronesian languages#Cross-linguistic Comparison Chart}}\nIndonesian is one of the many varieties of [[Malay language|Malay]].

This status has made it relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnic languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group, and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as the previous coloniser. Compared to the indigenous dialects of [[Malay language|Malay]] spoken in Sumatra and Malay peninsula or the normative Malaysian standard, the Indonesian language differs profoundly by a large amount of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] loanwords incorporated into its already-rich vocabulary. As a result, Indonesian has more extensive sources of [[list of loan words in Indonesian|loanwords]], compared to Malaysian Malay.

This has been based more upon political nuance and the history of their standardisation than cultural reasons, and as a result, there are asymmetrical views regarding each other's variety among Malaysians and Indonesians. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different normative varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate, albeit closely related, languages.

If the penult has a schwa, then stress moves to the ante-penultimate syllable if there is one, even if that syllable has a schwa as well; if the word is disyllabic, the stress is final. In disyllabic stress with a closed penultimate syllable, such as ''tinggal'' ('stay') and ''rantai'' ('chain'), stress falls on the penult.\n\nHowever, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.<ref name=\"ClynesDet2011\" /><ref name=\"Zur2008\">{{cite journal |first1=Zuraidah |last1=Mohd Don |last2=Knowles |first2=G. |last3=Yong |first3=J. |year=2008 |title=How words can be misleading: A study of syllable timing and 'stress' in Malay |journal=The Linguistics Journal |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=https://www.linguistics-journal.com/2014/01/08/how-words-can-be-misleading-a-study-of-syllable-timing-and-stress-in-malay/ |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801235943/https://www.linguistics-journal.com/2014/01/08/how-words-can-be-misleading-a-study-of-syllable-timing-and-stress-in-malay/ |archive-date=1 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/11/abstracts/Gil.pdf |accessdate=25 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225063313/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/11/abstracts/Gil.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2012  |last=Gil |first=David |title=A Typology of Stress, And Where Malay/Indonesian Fits In}} (abstract only)</ref>\n\n=== Rhythm ===\nThe classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic.<ref>Roach, P. (1982). \"On the distinction between 'stress-timed' and 'syllable-timed' languages\".  In D. Crystal (ed.), ''Linguistic Controversies'' (pp.&nbsp;73\u201379).

(2011). \"Measurements of the rhythm of Malay\". In ''Proceedings of the 17th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, Hong Kong, 17\u201321 August 2011'', pp. 576\u2013579.

However considerable flexibility in word ordering exists, in contrast with languages such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Korean language|Korean]], for instance, which always end clauses with verbs. Indonesian, while allowing for relatively flexible word orderings, does not mark for [[grammatical case]], nor does it make use of [[grammatical gender]].\n\n=== Affixes ===\nIn Indonesian, affixes take on an important role because slightly different affixes may have very different meanings. There are four types of affixes: [[prefixes]] (''awalan''), [[suffixes]] (''akhiran''), [[circumfixes]] (''apitan'') and [[infixes]] (''sisipan''). Affixes are categorised into noun, verb, and adjective affixes. Root words are either nouns or verbs, which can take on affixes to generate new words, for example, ''masak'' (to cook) may become ''memasak'' (cooks), ''memasakkan'' (cooks for), ''dimasak'' (is cooked), ''pemasak'' (a cook), ''masakan'' (a meal, cookery), \u2018\u2019termasak\u2019\u2019 (accidentally cooked). Many initial consonants alternate in the presence of prefixes: ''sapu'' (to sweep) becomes ''menyapu'' (sweeps/sweeping); ''panggil'' (to call) becomes ''memanggil'' (calls/calling), ''tapis'' (to sieve) becomes ''menapis'' (sieves).\n\nOther examples of the use of [[affix]]es to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word ''ajar'' (teach):\n* ''ajar'' = teach\n* '' ajar'''an''''' = teachings\n* '' '''bel'''ajar'' = to learn\n* '' '''meng'''ajar'' = to teach ([[intransitive verb|intransitive]])\n* '' '''meng'''ajar'''kan''''' = to teach ([[transitive verb|transitive]])\n* '' '''di'''ajar'' = to be taught (intransitive)\n* '' '''di'''ajar'''kan''''' = to be taught (transitive)\n* '' '''mempel'''ajar'''i''''' = to study\n* '' '''dipel'''ajar'''i''''' = to be studied\n* '' '''pel'''ajar'' = student\n* '' '''peng'''ajar'' = teacher\n* '' '''pel'''ajar'''an''''' = subject, education\n* '' '''peng'''ajar'''an''''' = lesson\n* '' '''pembel'''ajar'''an''''' = learning\n* '' '''ter'''ajar'' = taught (accidentally)\n* '' '''terpel'''ajar'' = well-educated, literally \"been taught\"\n* '' '''berpel'''ajar'''an''''' = is educated, literally \"has education\"\n\n==== Noun affixes ====\nNoun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Type of noun affixes\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Affix\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of root word\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of derived word\n|-\n|Prefix\n|p\u0259(r)- ~ p\u0259ng-\n|''duduk'' (sit)\n|'''''pen'''duduk'' (population)\n|-\n|\n|k\u0259-\n|''hendak'' (want)\n|'''''ke'''hendak'' (desire)\n|-\n|Infix\n| {{angbr|\u0259l}}\n|''tunjuk'' (point)\n|''t'''el'''unjuk'' (index finger, command)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259m}}\n|''kelut'' (dishevelled)\n|''k'''em'''elut'' (chaos, crisis)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259r}}\n|''gigi'' (teeth)\n|''g'''er'''igi'' (toothed blade)\n|-\n|Suffix\n| -an\n|''bangun'' (wake up, raise)\n|''bangun'''an''''' (building)\n|-\n|Circumfix\n|k\u0259-...-an\n|''raja'' (king)\n|'''''ke'''raja'''an''''' (kingdom)\n|-\n|\n|p\u0259(r)-...-an<br />p\u0259ng-...-an\n|''kerja'' (work)\n|'''''pe'''kerja'''an''''' (occupation)\n|}\n\nThe prefix ''per-'' drops its ''r'' before ''r, l'' and frequently before ''p, t, k.'' In some words it is ''peng-''; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Indonesian grammar books.\n\n==== Verb affixes ====\nSimilarly, verb affixes in Indonesian are attached to root words to form verbs. In Indonesian, there are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Type of verb affixes\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Affix\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of root word\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of derived word\n|-\n|Prefix\n|b\u0259r-\n|''ajar'' (teach)\n|''belajar'' (to study)<ref>The root ''ajar'' retrieves a historic initial ''l'' after the suffixes ''ber-'' and ''pe(r)-''.</ref>\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259ng-\n|''tolong'' (help)\n|''menolong'' (to help)\n|-\n|\n|di-\n|''ambil'' (take)\n|''diambil'' (be taken)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259mp\u0259r-\n|''panjang'' (length)\n|''memperpanjang'' (to lengthen)\n|-\n|\n|dip\u0259r-\n|''dalam'' (deep)\n|''diperdalam'' (be deepened)\n|-\n|\n|t\u0259r-\n|''makan'' (eat)\n|''termakan'' (to have accidentally eaten)\n|-\n|Suffix\n| -kan\n|''letak'' (place, keep)\n|''letakkan'' (keep, put)\n|-\n|\n| -i\n|''jauh'' (far)\n|''jauhi'' (avoid)\n|-\n|Circumfix\n|b\u0259r-...-an\n|''pasang'' (pair)\n|''berpasangan'' (in pairs)\n|-\n|\n|b\u0259r-...-kan\n|''dasar'' (base)\n|''berdasarkan'' (based on)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259ng-...-kan\n|''pasti'' (sure)\n|''memastikan'' (to make sure)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259ng-...-i\n|''teman'' (company)\n|''menemani'' (to accompany)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259mp\u0259r-...-kan\n|''guna'' (use)\n|''mempergunakan'' (to utilise, to exploit)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259mp\u0259r-...-i\n|''ajar'' (teach)\n|''mempelajari'' (to study)\n|-\n|\n|k\u0259-...-an\n|''hilang'' (disappear)\n|''kehilangan'' (to lose)\n|-\n|\n|di-...-i\n|''sakit'' (pain)\n|''disakiti'' (to be hurt by)\n|-\n|\n|di-...-kan\n|''benar'' (right)\n|''dibenarkan'' (is allowed to)\n|-\n|\n|dip\u0259r-...-kan\n|''kenal'' (know, recognise)\n|''diperkenalkan'' (is being introduced)\n|}\n\n==== Adjective affixes ====\nAdjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Type of adjective affixes\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Affix\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of root word\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of derived word\n|-\n|Prefix\n|t\u0259r-\n|''kenal'' (know)\n|''terkenal'' (famous)\n|-\n|\n|s\u0259-\n|''lari'' (run)\n|''selari'' (parallel)\n|-\n|Infix\n| {{angbr|\u0259l}}\n|''serak'' (disperse)\n|''selerak'' (messy)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259m}}\n|''cerlang'' (radiant bright)\n|''cemerlang'' (bright, excellent)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259r}}\n|''sabut'' (husk)\n|''serabut'' (dishevelled)\n|-\n|Circumfix\n|k\u0259-...-an\n|''barat'' (west)\n|''kebaratan'' (westernised)\n|}\n\nIn addition to these affixes, Indonesian also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, ''maha-'', ''pasca-'', ''eka-'', ''bi-'', ''anti-'', ''pro-'' etc.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nCommon derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterised by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result).\n\n==== Gender ====\nIndonesian does not make use of [[grammatical gender]], and there are only selected words that use natural [[gender]]. For instance, the same word is used for ''he/him'' and ''she/her'' ({{lang|id|dia}} or {{lang|id|ia}}) or for ''his'' and ''her'' ({{lang|id|dia}}, {{lang|id|ia}} or {{lang|id|-nya}}). No real distinction is made between \"girlfriend\" and \"boyfriend\", both {{lang|id|pacar}} (although more colloquial terms as {{lang|id|cewek}} girl/girlfriend and {{lang|id|cowok}} boy/boyfriend can also be found). A majority of Indonesian words that refer to people generally have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. However, unlike English, distinction is made between older or younger.\n\nThere are some words that have gender, for instance {{lang|id|putri}} means \"daughter\", and {{lang|id|putra}} means \"son\" and also {{lang|id|pramugara}} means \"male flight attendant\" and {{lang|id|pramugari}} meaning \"female flight attendant\". Another example would be {{lang|id|olahragawan}}, which equates to \"sportsman\", and {{lang|id|olahragawati}}, meaning sportswoman. Often, words like these (or certain suffixes such as \"-a\" and \"-i\" or \"-wan\" and \"wati\") are absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from [[Sanskrit]] through the Old [[Javanese language]]).\nIn some regions of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Jakarta, {{lang|id|abang}} (a gender-specific term meaning \"older brother\") is commonly used as a form of address for older siblings/males, while {{lang|id|kakak}} (a non-gender specific term meaning \"older sibling\") is often used to mean \"older sister\". Similarly, more direct influences from other languages, such as Javanese and Chinese, have also seen further use of other gendered words in Indonesian. For example: {{lang|jv|Mas}} (\"older brother\"), {{lang|jv|Mbak}} (\"older sister\"), {{lang|jv|Koko}} (\"older brother\") and {{lang|jv|Cici}} (\"older sister\").\n\n==== Number ====\nIndonesian grammar does not regularly mark [[plural]]s. In Indonesian, to change a singular into a plural one either repeats the word or adds ''para'' before it (the latter for living things only); for example, \"students\" can be either {{lang|id|murid-murid}} or {{lang|id|para murid}}. Plurals are rarely used in Indonesian, especially in informal parlance. Reduplication is often mentioned as the formal way to express the plural form of nouns in Indonesian; however, in informal daily [[discourse]], speakers of Indonesian usually use other [[Methodology|methods]] to indicate the [[concept]] of something being \"more than one\". Reduplication may also indicate the conditions of variety and diversity as well, and not simply plurality.\n\n[[Reduplication]] is commonly used to emphasise plurality; however, reduplication has many other functions. For example, ''orang-orang'' means \"(all the) people\", but ''orang-orangan'' means \"scarecrow\". Similarly, while ''hati'' means \"heart\" or \"liver\", ''hati-hati'' is a verb meaning \"to be careful\". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as ''orang-orangan'' \"scarecrow/scarecrows\", ''biri-biri'' \"a/some sheep\" and ''kupu-kupu'' \"butterfly/butterflies\". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in ''sayur-mayur'' \"(all sorts of) vegetables\".\n\nDistributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: ''pohon'' \"tree\", ''pepohonan'' \"[[flora]], trees\"; ''rumah'' \"house\", ''perumahan'' \"housing, houses\"; ''gunung'' \"mountain\", ''pegunungan'' \"mountain range, mountains\".\n\nQuantity words come before the noun: ''seribu orang'' \"a thousand people\", ''beberapa pegunungan'' \"a series of mountain ranges\", ''beberapa kupu-kupu'' \"some butterflies\".\n\nPlural in Indonesian serves just to explicitly mention the number of objects in sentence. For example, ''Ani membeli satu kilo mangga'' (Ani buys one kilogram of mangoes). In this case, \"mangoes\", which is plural, is not said as ''mangga-mangga'' because the plurality is implicit: the [[amount]] '''a kilogram''' means more than one mango. So, as it is logically, one does not change the singular into the plural form, because it is not necessary and considered a [[pleonasm]] (in Indonesian often called ''pemborosan kata'').\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nPersonal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say \"you\". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (\"does Johnny want to go?\", \"would Madam like to go?\"); kin terms, including [[fictive kinship]], are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns ''ini'' \"this, the\" and ''itu'' \"that, the\".\n\n==== Personal pronouns ====\nFrom the perspective of a European language, Indonesian boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker.\n\nThis table shows an overview over the most commonly and widely used pronouns of the Indonesian language:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common pronouns\n|-\n! width=75 |person\n! width=75 |\n! width=75 |respect\n! width=75 |singular\n! width=100 |plural\n|-\n! rowspan=3|1st person\n! rowspan=2|<small>exclusive</small>\n!<small>informal, familiar</small>\n| align=center|''aku''\n| rowspan=2 align=center|''kami''<br /><small>(we: they and me, she/he and me)</small>\n|-\n!<small>standard, polite</small>\n| align=center|''saya''\n|-\n!<small>inclusive</small>\n|\n|\n| align=center|''kita''<br /><small>(we: you and me, you and us)</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 2nd person\n|\n!<small>familiar</small>\n| align=center|''kamu'', ''engkau'', or ''kau''\n| align=center|''kalian''<br /><small>(you all)</small>\n|-\n|\n!<small>polite</small>\n| align=center|''Anda''<br /><small>(you)</small>\n| align=center|''Anda sekalian''<br /><small>(you all)</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | 3rd person\n| \n!<small>familiar</small>\n| align=center|''dia'' or ''ia''\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |''mereka'' <br /><small>(they)</small>\n|-\n| \n!<small>polite</small>\n| align=center|''Beliau''<br /><small>(he/she)</small>\n|}\n* '''First person pronouns'''\nNotable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between [[inclusive and exclusive we|two forms of \"we\"]]: ''kita'' (you and me, you and us) and ''kami'' (us, but not you). The distinction is not always followed in colloquial Indonesian.\n\n''Saya'' and ''aku'' are the two major forms of \"I\". ''Saya'' is the more formal form, whereas ''aku'' is used with family, friends, and between lovers. ''Sahaya'' is an old or literary form of ''saya''. ''Sa(ha)ya'' may also be used for \"we\", but in such cases it is usually used with ''sekalian'' or ''semua'' \"all\"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive ''kami'' or exclusive ''kita''. Less common are ''hamba'' \"slave\", ''hamba tuan, hamba datuk'' (all extremely humble), ''beta'' (a royal addressing oneselves), ''patik'' (a commoner addressing a royal), ''kami'' (royal or editorial \"we\"), ''kita'', ''t\u0259man'', and ''kawan.''\n* '''Second person pronouns'''\nThere are three common forms of \"you\", ''Anda'' (polite), ''kamu'' (familiar), and ''kalian'' \"all\" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). ''Anda'' is used with strangers, recent acquaintances, in advertisements, in business, and when you wish to show respect (though terms like ''tuan'' \"sir\" and other titles also show respect), while ''kamu'' is used in situations where the speaker would use ''aku'' for \"I\". ''Anda sekalian'' is polite plural.\n\n''Engkau'' (''\u0259ngkau''), commonly shortened to ''kau'', and ''hang'' are used to social inferiors, ''awak'' to equals, and ''\u0259ncik'' (''cek'' before a name) is polite, traditionally used for people without title. The compounds ''makcik'' and ''pakcik'' are used with village elders one is well acquainted with or the guest of.\n* '''Third person pronouns'''\nThe common word for \"s/he\" and \"they\" is ''ia'', which has the object and emphatic/focused form ''dia''. ''B\u0259liau'' \"his/her Honour\" is respectful. As with \"you\", names and kin terms are extremely common. ''Mereka'' \"someone\", ''mereka itu'', or ''orang itu'' \"those people\" are used for \"they\".\n* '''Regional varieties'''\nThere are a large number of other words for \"I\" and \"you\", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. ''Saudara'' \"you\" (male) and ''saudari'' (female) (plural ''saudara-saudara'' or ''saudari-saudari'') show utmost respect. ''Daku'' \"I\" and ''dikau'' \"you\" are poetic or romantic. Indonesian ''[[Indonesian slang language|gua]]'' \"I\" (from [[Hokkien]] {{zh|t=\u6211|poj=g\u00f3a}}) and ''[[Indonesian slang language|lu]]'' \"you\" ({{zh|t=\u6c5d|poj=l\u00fa}}) are slang and extremely informal.\n\nThe pronouns ''aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,'' and ''kita'' are indigenous to Indonesian.\n\n==== Possessive pronouns ====\n''Aku, kamu, engkau'', and ''ia'' have short possessive [[enclitic]] forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic ''dia'': ''meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia'' \"my table, our table, your table, his/her table\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Possessed forms of ''meja'' \"table\"\n! Pronoun\n! Enclitic\n! Possessed form\n|-\n|aku\n| -ku\n|''mejaku'' (my table)\n|-\n|kamu\n| -mu\n|''mejamu'' (your table)\n|-\n|ia\n| -nya\n|''mejanya'' (his, her, their table)\n|}\n\nThere are also [[proclitic]] forms of ''aku'', ''ku-'' and ''kau-''. These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:\n\n:'''''Ku'''-dengar raja itu menderita penyakit kulit. '''Aku''' mengetahui ilmu kedokteran. '''Aku-lah''' yang akan mengobati dia.''\n:\"It has come to my attention that the King has a skin disease. I am skilled in medicine. ''I'' will cure him.\"\nHere ''ku-''verb is used for a general report, ''aku'' verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic ''aku-lah meng-''verb (\u2248 \"I am the one who...\") for focus on the pronoun.<ref>M.B. Lewis, 1947, ''Teach Yourself Indonesian'', p. 178, ASIN: B0007JGNQO</ref>\n\n==== Demonstrative pronouns ====\nThere are two [[demonstrative pronoun]]s in Indonesian. ''Ini'' \"this, these\" is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. ''Itu'' \"that, those\" is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English \"the\". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a ''ini'' or ''itu''. The word ''yang'' \"which\" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/ someone, like English \"this one\" or \"that one\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun\n! Indonesian\n! English\n|-\n! rowspan=2|ini\n| ''buku ini''\n| This book, these books, the book(s)\n|-\n| ''buku-buku ini''\n| These books, (all) the books\n|-\n! rowspan=2| itu\n| ''kucing itu''\n| That cat, those cats, the cat(s)\n|-\n| ''kucing-kucing itu''\n| Those cats, the (various) cats\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote [[voice (grammar)|voice]] or intentional and accidental [[grammatical mood|moods]]. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.\n\nExamples of these are the prefixes ''di-'' ([[Austronesian alignment|patient focus]], traditionally called \n\"passive voice\", with OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in the first or second persons), ''meng-'' ([[Austronesian alignment|agent focus]], traditionally called \n\"active voice\", with AVO word order), ''memper-'' and ''diper-'' ([[causative]], agent and patient focus), ''ber-'' ([[stative verb|stative]] or habitual; intransitive VS order), and ''ter-'' (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes ''-kan'' (causative or [[benefactive]]) and ''-i'' (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes ''ber-...-an'' ([[pluractionality|plural subject, diffuse action]]) and ''ke-...-an'' (unintentional or potential action or state).\n\n* ''duduk'' to sit down\n* ''mendudukkan'' to sit someone down, give someone a seat, to appoint\n* ''menduduki'' to sit on, to occupy\n* ''didudukkan'' to be given a seat, to be appointed\n* ''diduduki'' to be sat on, to be occupied\n* ''terduduk'' to sink down, to come to sit\n* ''kedudukan'' to be situated\n\nForms in ''ter-'' and ''ke-...-an'' are often equivalent to adjectives in English.\n\n==== Negation ====\nFour words are used for negation in Indonesian, namely ''tidak'', ''bukan'', ''jangan'', and ''belum''.\n\n* '''''Tidak''''' (not), often shortened to '''''tak''''', is used for the negation of verbs and \"adjectives\".\n* '''''Bukan''''' (be-not) is used in the negation of a noun.\nFor example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Indonesian\n!Gloss\n!English\n|-\n|''Saya '''tidak''' tahu'' (Saya '''tak''' tahu)\n|I '''not''' know\n|I do '''not''' know\n|-\n|''Ibu saya '''tidak''' senang'' (Ibu saya '''tak''' senang)\n|mother I '''not''' be-happy\n|My mother is '''not''' happy\n|-\n|''Itu '''bukan''' anjing saya''\n|that '''be-not''' dog I\n|That '''is not''' my dog\n|}\n\n==== Prohibition ====\nFor negating imperatives or advising against certain actions in Indonesian, the word ''jangan'' (do not) is used before the verb. For example,\n*  '''''Jangan''''' tinggalkan saya di sini!\n:'''Don't''' leave me here!\n*  '''''Jangan''''' lakukan itu!\n:'''Don't''' do that!\n*  '''''Jangan'''''! Itu tidak bagus untukmu.\n:'''Don't!''' That's not good for you.\n\n=== Adjectives ===\nThere are grammatical adjectives in Indonesian. [[Stative verb]]s are often used for this purpose as well. Adjectives are always placed after the noun that they modify. Hence, \"rumah saya\" means \"my house\", while \"saya rumah\" means \"I am a house\". \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Indonesian\n!Gloss\n!English\n|-\n|''Hutan hijau''\n|forest green\n|(The) green forest.\n|-\n|''Hutan itu hijau''\n|forest that green\n|That/the forest is green.\n|-\n|''K\u0259reta yang merah''\n|carriage which (is) red.\n|(The) carriage which is red = the red carriage.\n|-\n|''K\u0259reta merah''\n|carriage red.\n|Red carriage.\n|-\n|''Dia orang yang terkenal sekali''\n|he/she person which be-famous very\n|He/she is a very famous person\n|-\n|''Orang terkenal''\n|person famous.\n|Famous person.\n|-\n|''Orang ini terkenal sekali''\n|person this be-famous very\n|This person is very famous\n|}\n\nTo say that something \"is\" an adjective, the determiners \"itu\" and \"ini\" (\"that\" and \"this\") are often used. For example, in the sentence \"anjing itu galak\", the use of \"itu\" gives a meaning of \"the/that dog is ferocious\", while \"anjing ini galak\", gives a meaning of \"this dog is ferocious\". However, if \"itu\" or \"ini\" were not to be used, then \"anjing galak\" would meaning only \"ferocious dog\", a plain adjective without any stative implications. The all-purpose determiner, \"yang\", is also often used before adjectives, hence \"anjing yang galak\" also means \"ferocious dog\" or more literally \"dog which is ferocious\"; \"yang\" will often be used for clarity. Hence, in a sentence such as \"saya didekati oleh anjing galak\" which means \"I was approached by a ferocious dog\", the use of the adjective \"galak\" is not stative at all.\n\nOften the \"ber-\" intransitive verb prefix, or the \"ter-\" stative prefix is used to express the meaning of \"to be...\". For example, \"beda\" means \"different\", hence \"berbeda\" means \"to be different\"; \"awan\" means \"cloud\", hence \"berawan\" means \"cloudy\". Using the \"ter-\" prefix, implies a state of being. For example, \"buka\" means \"open\", hence \"terbuka\" means \"is opened\"; \"tutup\" means \"closed/shut\", hence \"tertutup\" means \"is closed/shut\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nAdjectives, [[demonstrative]] determiners, and [[possessive]] determiners follow the noun they modify.\n\nIndonesian does not have a [[grammatical subject]] in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and an [[object (grammar)|object]], these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.\n\nEither the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:\n\n;1) Adding a sense of politeness and respect to a statement or question\n\nFor example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ellipses of pronoun (agent & object)\n! Literal English\n! Idiomatic English\n|-\n| Bisa ''dibantu?''\n| Can + ''to be helped''?\n| Can (I) ''help'' (you)?\n|}\n\n;2) Agent or object is unknown, not important, or understood from context\n\nFor example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ellipses of pronoun (understood agent)\n! Literal English\n! Idiomatic English\n|-\n| ''Rumah ini '''dibeli''' lima tahun yang lalu''\n| House this + ''be purchased'' five-year(s) ago\n| The house 'was purchased' five years ago\n|}\n\nUltimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.\n\n==== Emphasis ====\nWord order is frequently modified for [[focus (grammar)|focus]] or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]):\n\n* ''Saya pergi ke pasar kemarin'' \"I went to the market yesterday\" \u2013 neutral, or with focus on the subject.\n* ''Kemarin saya pergi ke pasar'' \"Yesterday I went to the market\" \u2013 emphasis on yesterday.\n* ''Ke pasar saya pergi, kemarin'' \"To the market I went yesterday\" \u2013 emphasis on where I went yesterday.\n* ''Pergi ke pasar, saya, kemarin'' \"To the market went I yesterday\" \u2013 emphasis on the process of going to the market.\n\nThe last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.\n\n=== Measure words ===\nAnother distinguishing feature of Indonesian is its use of [[measure word]]s, also called [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] (''kata penggolong''). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]].\n\nMeasure words are also found in English such as ''two head of cattle'', ''a loaf of bread'', or ''this sheet of paper'', where ''*two cattle, a bread,'' and ''this paper'' (in the sense of ''this piece of paper'') would be ungrammatical. The word ''satu'' reduces to ''se-'' {{IPA|/s\u0259/}}, as it does in other compounds:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Measure word\n! Used for measuring\n! Literal translation\n!

It was originally based on the [[Dutch spelling]] and still bears some similarities to it. Consonants are represented in a way similar to [[Italian language#Writing system|Italian]], although {{angle bracket|c}} is always {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (like English {{angle bracket|ch}}), {{angle bracket|g}} is always {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (\"hard\") and {{angle bracket|j}} represents {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} as it does in English. In addition, {{angle bracket|ny}} represents the [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{angle bracket|ng}} is used for the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (which can occur word-initially), {{angle bracket|sy}} for {{IPA|/\u0283/}} (English {{angle bracket|sh}}) and {{angle bracket|kh}} for the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}. Both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}} are represented with {{angle bracket|e}}.\n\nSpelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Phoneme!!Obsolete<br />spelling!!Modern<br />spelling\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|u}}||oe||u\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|t\u0283}}||tj||c\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|d\u0292}}||dj||j\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|j}}||j||y\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|\u0272}}||nj||ny\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|\u0283}}||sj||sy\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|x}}||ch||kh\n|}\n\nIntroduced in 1901, the [[van Ophuijsen Spelling System|''van Ophuijsen'' system]], (named from the advisor of the system, Charles Adriaan van Ophuijsen) was the first standardisation of romanised spelling. It was most influenced by the then current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling system]]. In 1947, the spelling was changed into ''[[Republican Spelling System|Republican Spelling]]'' or ''Soewandi Spelling'' (named by at the time Minister of Education, Soewandi). This spelling changed formerly spelled ''oe'' into ''u'' (however, the spelling influenced other aspects in orthography, for example writing reduplicated words). All of the other changes were a part of the [[Perfected Spelling System]], an officially mandated [[spelling reform]] in 1972. Some of the old spellings (which were derived from [[Dutch orthography]]) do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of Indonesia is still sometimes written ''[[Suharto|Soeharto]]'', and the central Java city of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] is sometimes written ''Jogjakarta''. In time, the spelling system is further updated and the latest update of Indonesian spelling system issued on 26 November 2015 by Minister of Education and Culture decree No 50/2015.\n\n=== Letter names and pronunciations ===\nThe [[Malay alphabet|Indonesian alphabet]] is exactly the same as in ISO basic Latin alphabet.\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- \t \n|bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"26\" | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule Forms]]'''\n|-\n|width=3% align=\"center\"|[[A]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[B]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[C]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[D]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[E]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[F]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[G]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[H]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[I]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[J]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[K]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[L]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[M]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[N]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[O]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[P]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[Q]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[R]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[S]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[T]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[U]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[V]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[W]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[X]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[Y]]||width=3% align=\"center\"|[[Z]]\n|- \t\n|bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"26\" | '''[[Lower case|Minuscule Forms]]'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|a||align=\"center\"|b||align=\"center\"|c||align=\"center\"|d||align=\"center\"|e||align=\"center\"|f||align=\"center\"|g||align=\"center\"|h||align=\"center\"|i||align=\"center\"|j||align=\"center\"|k||align=\"center\"|l||align=\"center\"|m||align=\"center\"|n||align=\"center\"|o||align=\"center\"|p||align=\"center\"|q||align=\"center\"|r||align=\"center\"|s||align=\"center\"|t||align=\"center\"|u||align=\"center\"|v||align=\"center\"|w||align=\"center\"|x||align=\"center\"|y||align=\"center\"|z\n|}\n</center>\n\nIndonesian follows the letter names of the [[Dutch alphabet]].

The words were either borrowed directly from India or with the intermediary of the [[Old Javanese language]]. Although [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, [[Sanskrit]], which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of [[Latin]] in [[English language|English]] and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for [[neologism]]s, these are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of [[religion]], [[art]] and everyday life.\n\nFrom [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] came such words as \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917 ''surga'' (heaven), \u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e ''bahasa'' (language), \u0915\u093e\u091a ''kaca'' (glass, mirror), \u0930\u093e\u091c- ''raja'' (king), \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f ''manusia'' (mankind), \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e ''cinta'' (love), \u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f ''bumi'' (earth), \u092d\u0941\u0935\u0928 ''buana'' (world), \u0906\u0917\u092e ''agama'' (religion), \u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 ''Istri'' (wife/woman), \u091c\u092f ''Jaya'' (victory/victorious), \u092a\u0941\u0930 ''Pura'' (city/temple/place) \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938 ''[[Raksasa]]'' (giant/monster), \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e ''[[Dharma]]'' (rule/regulations), \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 ''[[Mantra]]'' (words/poet/spiritual prayers), \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f ''Satria'' (warrior/brave/soldier), \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f ''Wijaya'' (greatly victorious/great victory), etc. [[Sanskrit]] words and sentences are also used in names, titles, and mottos of the Indonesian National Police and Indonesian Armed Forces such as: ''[[Indonesian National Police|Bhayangkara]]'', ''[[Laksamana]]'', ''[[Jatayu]]'', ''[[Garuda]]'', ''Dharmakerta Marga Reksyaka'', ''[[Indonesian Navy|Jalesveva Jayamahe]]'', ''[[Indonesian Army|Kartika Eka Paksi]]'', ''[[Indonesian Air Force|Swa Bhuwana Paksa]]'', ''[[Indonesian National Police|Rastra Sewakottama]]'', ''Yudha Siaga'', etc.\n\nBecause [[Sanskrit]] has long been known in the [[Indonesian archipelago]], Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign. Therefore, one could write a short story using only Sanskrit words.

At the kingdom of Srivijaya appeared and flourished, China opened diplomatic relations with the kingdom in order to secure trade and seafaring. In 922, Chinese travelers visited [[Kahuripan]] in [[East Java]]. Since the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants left [[Mainland China]] and settled in many parts of Nusantara (now called Indonesia).\n\nThe [[Chinese language|Chinese]] loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just things exclusively Chinese. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying [[Hokkien]]/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as [[Traditional characters|traditional]] and [[simplified characters]]) include ''pisau'' (\u5315\u9996 b\u01d0sh\u01d2u &nbsp;\u2013 knife), ''loteng'', (\u6a13/\u5c64 = l\u00f3u/c\u00e9ng&nbsp;\u2013 [upper] floor/ level), ''mie'' (\u9eb5 > \u9762 Hokkien m\u012b&nbsp;\u2013 noodles), ''[[lumpia]]'' (\u6f64\u9905 (Hokkien = l\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f)&nbsp;\u2013 springroll), ''cawan'' (\u8336\u7897 ch\u00e1w\u01cen&nbsp;\u2013 teacup), ''teko'' (\u8336\u58fa > \u8336\u58f6 = ch\u00e1h\u00fa [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), \u82e6\u529b kuli = \u82e6 khu (hard) and \u529b li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms ''gua'' and ''lu'' (from the Hokkien 'goa' \u6211 and 'lu/li' \u6c5d&nbsp;\u2013 meaning 'I/ me' and 'you').\n\n=== Loan words of Arabic origin ===\n[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Istiqlal-Mosque-03.jpg|thumb|The word ''masjid'' (mosque) in Indonesian derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|masjid}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f|rtl=yes}}).]]\nMany Arabic words were brought and spread by merchants from [[Arab Peninsula]] like [[Arabian people|Arabian]], [[Persian people|Persian]], and from the western part of India, [[Gujarat]] where many Muslims lived.<ref name=\"catdir.loc.gov\">{{Cite book |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98020577.pdf |title=Shifting Languages: Interaction and Identity in Javanese Indonesia |chapter=Introduction |first=J.

This century is known as ''The Golden Age of Indonesian Literature''.<ref name=\"catdir.loc.gov\"/>\n\nMany loanwords from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with [[Islam]], and by extension, with greetings such as the word, \"selamat\" (from {{lang-ar|\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|sal\u0101ma}}'' = health, soundness)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://asalkata.com/?q=selamat |title=Etymology of \"selamat\" in ''Asalkata.com'' |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024205854/http://asalkata.com/?q=selamat |archive-date=24 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> means \"safe\" or \"lucky\". Words of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin include ''dunia'' (from {{lang-ar|\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|duny\u0101}}'' = the present world), names of days (except ''Minggu''), such as ''Sabtu'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0633\u0628\u062a}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sabt-u}}'' = Saturday), ''iklan'' ({{lang|ar|\u0622\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i\u02bblan}}'' = advertisement), ''kabar'' ({{lang|ar|\u062e\u0628\u0631|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|khabar}}'' = news), ''Kursi'' ({{lang|ar|\u0643\u0631\u0633\u064a|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kurs\u012b}}'' = a chair), ''jumat'' ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jum\u02bba}}'' = Friday), ''ijazah'' ({{lang|ar|\u0625\u062c\u0627\u0632\u0629|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|ij\u0101za}}'' = 'permission', certificate of authority, e.g. a school diploma certificate), ''kitab'' ({{lang|ar|\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|kit\u0101b}}'' = book), ''tertib'' ({{lang|ar|\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|tart\u012bb}}'' = order/arrangement) and ''kamus'' ({{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633|rtl=yes}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|q\u0101m\u016bs}}'' = dictionary). [[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}}), as it is mostly the case for [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]] speakers, is the word for [[God]] even in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to [[Greek language|Greek]] names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name [[Jesus]] was initially translated as ''<nowiki/>'Isa'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u064a\u0633\u0649}}), but is now spelt as ''Yesus''. Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language. Indonesian word for ''[[bishop]]'' is ''uskup'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0623\u0633\u0642\u0641}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|usquf}}'' = bishop). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for [[archbishop]] ''uskup agung'' (literally ''great bishop''), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term ''imam'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|im\u0101m}}'' = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic [[priest]], beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation ''jemaat'' (from {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jam\u0101\u02bba}}'' = group, a community). Even the name of the [[Bible]] in Indonesian translation is ''Alkitab'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|al-kit\u0101b}}'' = the book), which literally means \"the Book\".\n\n=== Loan words of Portuguese origin ===\n[[File:Front gate Ganjuran.jpg|thumb|Indonesian word \"''[[wikt:gereja|Gereja]]''\" (Church) is derived from Portuguese \"''[[wikt:igreja|Igreja]]''\". The sign reads: [[Ganjuran Church|\"''Gereja & Candi Hati Kudus Tuhan Yesus Ganjuran Keuskupan Agung Semarang''\"]] (The Church and [[Temple]] of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] Ganjuran [[Archdiocese of Semarang]]).]]\nAlongside [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail eastwards to the \"[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]\". Loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian words derived from Portuguese include ''meja'' (from mesa = table), ''bangku'' (from banco = bench), ''lemari/almari'' (from arm\u00e1rio = closet), ''boneka'' (from boneca = doll), ''jendela'' (from janela = window), ''Gereja'' (from Igreja = Church), ''Misa'' (from Missa = Mass), ''Natal'' (from Natal = Christmas), ''Paskah'' (from P\u00e1scoa = Easter), ''pesta'' (from festa = party), ''dansa'' (from dan\u00e7a = dance), ''pesiar'' (from passear = cruise), ''bendera'' (from bandeira = flag), ''sepatu'' (from sapato = shoes), ''garpu'' (from garfo = fork), ''kemeja'' (from camisa = shirt), ''kereta'' (from carreta = chariot), ''pompa'' (from bomba hidr\u00e1ulica = pump), ''pigura'' (from figura = picture), ''roda'' (from roda = wheel), ''nona'' (from dona = young woman), ''sekolah'' (from escola = school), ''lentera'' (from lanterna = lantern), ''paderi'' (from padre = priest), ''Santo, Santa'' (from Santo, Santa = Saint), ''puisi'' (from poesia = poetry), ''keju'' (from queijo = cheese), ''mentega'' (from manteiga = butter), ''serdadu'' (from soldado = soldier), ''meski'' (from mas que = although), ''kamar'' (from c\u00e2mara = room), ''laguna'' (from laguna = lagoon), ''lelang'' (from leil\u00e3o = auction), ''persero'' (from parceiro = company), ''markisa'' (from maracuj\u00e1 = passion fruit), ''limau'' (from lim\u00e3o = lemon), ''kartu'' (from cart\u00e3o = card), ''Inggris'' (from ingl\u00eas = English), ''Sabtu'' (from s\u00e1bado = Saturday), ''Minggu'' (from domingo = Sunday), etc.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp24\">{{Cite book | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300 |edition=2nd | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | pages =26  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-333-57689-2 }}</ref>\n\n=== Loan words of Dutch origin ===\n{{see also|List of Dutch loanwords in Indonesian}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Glodok wijk te Djakarta TMnr 10014951.jpg|thumb|alt=Crowd at a busy street intersection.

These [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanwords, and many other non-Italo-Iberian, European language loanwords that came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the [[schwa]]. For example, Dutch ''schroef'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sxruf]}} > ''sekrup'' {{IPA|[s\u0259\u02c8krup]}} (screw (n.)). One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words are inspired by the [[Dutch language]].<ref name=\"mai\">{{Cite journal|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/|title=A Hidden Language \u2013 Dutch in Indonesia|author=Hendrik M.

As a result, Malay words are written with that orthography such as: {{lang|ms|passer}} for the word {{lang|id|Pasar}} or {{lang|ms|djalan}} for the word {{lang|id|jalan}}, older Indonesian generation tend to have their name written in such order as well.\n\n=== Loan words of English origin ===\nMany English words were incorporated into Indonesian through [[globalisation]]. Many Indonesians, however, mistake words already adopted from Dutch as words borrowed from English. This is due to the Germanic traces that exist in the two languages. Indonesian adopts English words with standardisation. For example: {{lang|id|ima'''j'''ina'''si'''}} from {{lang|en|ima'''g'''ina'''tion'''}}, {{lang|id|universi'''tas'''}} from {{lang|en|universi'''ty'''}}, {{lang|id|a'''ks'''esor'''i'''}} from {{lang|en|a'''cc'''essor'''y'''}}, {{lang|id|geogra'''fi'''}} from {{lang|en|geogra'''phy'''}}, {{lang|id|'''k'''onserva'''tif'''}} from {{lang|en|'''c'''onserva'''tive'''}}, {{lang|id|r'''u'''ti'''n'''}} from {{lang|en|r'''ou'''ti'''ne'''}}, and so other.<ref name=\"lib.ui.ac.id\">{{Cite web |url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital%2F20316254-S42391-Kata%20serapan.pdf |title=Kata Serapan dan Kata Non-Serapan dalam Orang Asing dan Sang Pemberontak: Sebuah Kajian Semantis |trans-title=The Loanword and Non-Loanword in Orang Asing and Sang Pemberontak: A Semantic Study |publisher=University of Indonesia |date=2011 |author=Katarina Mellyna |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011113426/http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital%2F20316254-S42391-Kata%20serapan.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, there are several words that directly borrowed without standardisation that have same meanings in English such as: ''bus'', ''data'', ''domain'', ''detail'', ''internet'', ''film'', ''golf'', ''lift'', ''monitor'', ''radio'', ''radar'', ''unit'', ''safari'', ''sonar'', and ''video'', ''riil as real''.<ref name=\"lib.ui.ac.id\"/>\n\n=== Other loan words ===\nModern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources, there are many [[synonym]]s. For example, Indonesian has three words for \"book\", i.e. {{lang|id|pustaka}} (from Sanskrit), {{lang|id|kitab}} (from Arabic) and {{lang|id|buku}} (from Dutch {{lang|nl|boek}}); however, each has a slightly different meaning. A {{lang|id|pustaka}} is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, {{lang|id|perpustakaan}} means a library. A {{lang|id|kitab}} is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidance. The Indonesian words for the [[Bible]] and [[Gospel]] are {{lang|id|Alkitab}} and {{lang|id|Injil}}, both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the {{lang|id|kitab}}. {{lang|id|Buku}} is the most common word for books.\n\nThere are direct borrowings from various other languages of the world, such as ''karaoke'' (from {{lang|ja|\u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1}}) from [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and ''ebi'' (from {{lang|ja|\u3048\u3073}}) which means dried shrimp. Many words that originally are adopted through the Dutch language today however often are mistaken as English due to the similarity in the Germanic nature of both languages. In some cases the words are replaced by English language through globalisation: although the word {{lang|id|arbei}} (Dutch: {{lang|nl|aardbei}}) still literally means strawberry in Indonesian, today the usage of the word {{lang|id|stroberi}} is more common. [[Greek language|Greek]] words such as ''demokrasi'' (from \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ''d\u0113mokrat\u00eda''), ''filosofi'' (from \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 ''philasophia''), ''mitos'' (from \u03bc\u1fe6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ''mythos'') came through Dutch, Arabic and Portuguese respectively.\n\nIt is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilises words that reflect the [[English language|English]] usage (as used by its former colonial power, the [[United Kingdom|British]]), while Indonesian uses a [[Latin]]ate form reflected in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] usage (e.g. ''aktiviti'' (Malaysian) vs. ''aktivitas'' (Indonesian), ''universiti'' (Malaysian) vs. ''universitas'' (Indonesian)).\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Indonesian literature}}\n\nIndonesia hosts a variety of traditional verbal arts such as [[poetry]], [[Narrative history|historical narratives]], [[romance film|romances]], and [[drama]]; which are expressed in local languages, but modern genres are expressed mainly through Indonesian.<ref name=\"hawaii.edu\"/> Some of classic Indonesian stories include [[Sitti Nurbaya]] by [[Marah Rusli]], [[Azab dan Sengsara]] by [[Merari Siregar]], and [[Sengsara Membawa Nikmat]] by [[Tulis Sutan Sati]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resourcefulindonesian.com/indonesian-literature.html|title=Indonesian Literature|website=Resourceful Indonesian|access-date=13 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618175250/https://www.resourcefulindonesian.com/indonesian-literature.html|archive-date=18 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/09/pdf32-1/32-1p.03-4.pdf |title=Recent Writers in Indonesia  |last=Sumardjo |first=Jakob |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011113425/http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/09/pdf32-1/32-1p.03-4.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2017 |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref> Modern literature like [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], stage plays, and [[Free verse|free-form poetry]] has developed since the late years of the 19th century and has produced such internationally recognised figures as [[novelist]] [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]], [[dramatist]] [[Willibrordus S.

However, it does [[Comparison of Standard Malay and Indonesian|differ]] from Malaysian Malay in several respects, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. These differences are due mainly to the Dutch and Javanese influences on Indonesian. Indonesian was also influenced by the {{lang|id|Melayu pasar}} (literally \"market Malay\"), which was the lingua franca of the archipelago in colonial times, and thus indirectly by other spoken languages of the islands.\n\nMalaysian Malay claims to be closer to the classical Malay of earlier centuries, even though modern Malaysian has been heavily influenced, in lexicon as well as in syntax, by English. The question of whether High Malay (Court Malay) or Low Malay (Bazaar Malay) was the true parent of the Indonesian language is still in debate. High Malay was the official language used in the court of the [[Johor Sultanate]] and continued by the Dutch-administered territory of [[Riau-Lingga]], while Low Malay was commonly used in marketplaces and ports of the archipelago. Some linguists have argued that it was the more common Low Malay that formed the base of the Indonesian language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1626/bahasa-indonesia-memasyarakatkan-kembali-bahasa-pasar |title=Bahasa Indonesia: Memasyarakatkan Kembali 'Bahasa Pasar'? |publisher=Melayu Online |accessdate=29 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630131527/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1626/bahasa-indonesia-memasyarakatkan-kembali-bahasa-pasar |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Dutch colonial era ===\nWhen the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) first arrived in the archipelago, the Malay language was a significant trading and political language due to the influence of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malaccan Sultanate]] and later the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. However, the language had never been dominant among the population of the Indonesian archipelago as it was limited to mercantile activity. The VOC adopted the Malay language as the administrative language of their trading outpost in the east. Following the [[bankruptcy]] of the VOC, the [[Batavian Republic]] took control of the colony in 1799, and it was only then that education in and promotion of Dutch began in the [[colony]]. Even then, Dutch administrators were remarkably reluctant to promote the use of Dutch compared to other colonial regimes. Dutch thus remained the language of a small elite: in 1940, only 2% of the total population could speak Dutch. Nevertheless, it did have a significant influence on the development of Malay in the colony: during the colonial era, the language that would be standardised as Indonesian absorbed a large amount of Dutch vocabulary in the form of [[loanwords]].\n\n=== Birth of the Indonesian language ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Opening van de Volksraad door gouverneur-generaal Van Limburg Stirum op 18 mei 1918 op Java TMnr 10001373.jpg|thumb|''[[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]]'' session held in July 1938 in Jakarta, where Indonesian was formally used for the first time by Jahja Datoek Kajo.]]\n\nThe [[Indonesian National Awakening|nationalist movement]] that ultimately brought Indonesian to its national language status rejected [[Dutch language|Dutch]] from the outset. However, the rapid disappearance of Dutch was a very unusual case compared with other colonised countries, where the colonial language generally has continued to function as the language of politics, [[bureaucracy]], education, [[technology]], and other fields of importance for a significant time after independence.<ref name=\"Swaan\"/> Soenjono Dardjowidjojo even goes so far as to say that \"Indonesian is perhaps the only language that has achieved the status of a national language in its true sense\"{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} since it truly dominates in all spheres of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian society]]. The ease with which Indonesia eliminated the language of its former colonial power can perhaps be explained as much by Dutch [[policy]] as by Indonesian nationalism. In marked contrast to the [[France|French]], [[Spain|Spanish]] and Portuguese, who pursued an [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] colonial policy, or even the [[British Empire|British]], the Dutch did not attempt to spread their language among the indigenous population. In fact, they consciously prevented the language from being spread by refusing to provide education, especially in Dutch, to the native Indonesians so they would not come to see themselves as equals.<ref name=\"Swaan\"/> Moreover, the Dutch wished to prevent the Indonesians from elevating their perceived social status by taking on elements of Dutch culture. Thus, until the 1930s, they maintained a minimalist regime and allowed Malay to spread quickly throughout the archipelago.\n\nDutch dominance at that time covered nearly all aspects, with official forums requiring the use of Dutch, although since the Second Youth Congress (1928) the use of Indonesian as the national language was agreed on as one of the tools in the independence struggle. As of it, [[Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin]] inveighed actions underestimating Indonesian. After some criticism and protests, the use of Indonesian was allowed since the ''Volksraad'' sessions held in July 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html|title=The Indonesian Language \u2013 Bahasa Indonesia|date=8 May 2005|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508115242/http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html|archivedate=8 May 2005}}</ref> By the time they tried to counter the spread of Malay by teaching Dutch to the natives, it was too late, and in 1942, the Japanese conquered Indonesia and outlawed the use of the Dutch language.

On the last pledge, there was an affirmation of Indonesian language as a ''unifying language'' throughout the archipelago.]]\n\nThe adoption of Indonesian as the country's national language was in contrast to most other post-colonial states. Neither the language with the most native speakers (Javanese) nor the language of the former European colonial power (Dutch) was to be adopted. Instead, a local language with far fewer native speakers than the most widely spoken local language was chosen (nevertheless, Malay was the second most widely spoken language in the colony after Javanese, and had many L2 speakers using it for trade, administration, and education).\n\nIn 1945, when Indonesia declared its independence, Indonesian was formally declared the national language,<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Indonesian Language |publisher=Language Translation, Inc. |url=http://www.languagetranslation.com/translation/languages/indonesian-translation4.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043125/http://www.languagetranslation.com/translation/languages/indonesian-translation4.html |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref> despite being the native language of only about 5% of the population.

With thousands of islands and hundreds of different languages, the newly independent country of Indonesia had to find a national language that could realistically be spoken by the majority of the population and that would not divide the nation by favouring one ethnic group, namely the Javanese, over the others. In 1945, Indonesian was already in widespread use;<ref name=Kratz/> in fact, it had been for roughly a thousand years. Over that long period, Malay, which would later become standardised as Indonesian, was the primary language of [[commerce]] and [[travel]]. It was also the language used for the propagation of [[Islam]] in the 13th to 17th centuries, as well as the language of instruction used by Portuguese and Dutch missionaries attempting to convert the indigenous people to [[Christianity]].<ref name=Swaan/> The combination of these factors meant that the language was already known to some degree by most of the population, and it could be more easily adopted as the national language than perhaps any other. Moreover, it was the language of the sultanate of [[Brunei]] and of future [[Malaysia]], on which [[Greater Indonesia|some Indonesian nationalists had claims]].\n\nOver the first 53 years of [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], the country's first two presidents, [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] constantly nurtured the sense of national unity embodied by Indonesian, and the language remains an essential component of Indonesian identity. Through a language planning program that made Indonesian the language of [[politics]], [[education]], and nation-building in general, Indonesian became one of the few success stories of an [[indigenous language]] effectively overtaking that of a country's colonisers to become the ''[[de jure]]'' and ''[[de facto]]'' official language.<ref name=\"Paauw\">{{cite journal|last1=Paauw|first1=Scott|title=One Land, One Nation, One Language: An Analysis of Indonesia's National Language Policy|journal=University of Rochester Working Papers in the Language Sciences|date=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=2\u201316|url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/cls/assets/pdf/working/Paauw.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218024007/http://www.rochester.edu/college/cls/assets/pdf/working/Paauw.pdf|archive-date=18 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, Indonesian continues to function as the language of [[national identity]] as the Congress of Indonesian Youth envisioned, and also serves as the language of education, [[literacy]], [[modernization theory|modernisation]], and [[social mobility]].<ref name=\"Paauw\" /> Despite still being a second language to most Indonesians, it is unquestionably the language of the Indonesian nation as a whole, as it has had unrivalled success as a factor in nation-building and the strengthening of Indonesian identity.\n\n=== Modern and colloquial Indonesian ===\n{{further|Indonesian slang}}\n[[File:Sukarno hatta airport - Terminal - Jakarta - Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|Road-signs in an airport terminal]]\n[[File:Kuta Bali Indonesia Tol-Station-Nusa-Dua-01.jpg|thumb|Toll gate in Indonesia]]\n[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Bus-stop-Monumen-Nasional-02.jpg|thumb|right|Indonesian language used on a bus advertisement]]\n\nWhile Indonesian is spoken as a [[mother tongue]] by only a small proportion of the population (i.e. mainly those who reside within the vicinity of [[Jakarta]] and other large predominantly Indonesian-speaking cities such as [[Medan]] and [[Balikpapan]]), over 200 million people regularly make use of the national language, with varying degrees of proficiency. In a nation that boasts more than 700 native languages and a vast array of ethnic groups, it plays an important unifying and cross-archipelagic role for the country. Use of the national language is abundant in the media, [[government]] bodies, [[school]]s, [[University|universities]], [[workplace]]s, among members of the upper-class or nobility and also in formal situations, despite the 2010 census showing only 19.94% of over-five-year-olds speak mainly Indonesian at home.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/kewarganegaraan%20penduduk%20indonesia/index.html | title=Publication Name | access-date=4 December 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710134114/http://sp2010.bps.go.id/files/ebook/kewarganegaraan%20penduduk%20indonesia/index.html | archive-date=10 July 2017 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nStandard Indonesian is used in books and newspapers and on television/radio news broadcasts. The standard dialect, however, is rarely used in daily conversations, being confined mostly to formal settings. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to its written standards), the proximity of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) to its normative form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to Indonesians combining aspects of their own local languages (e.g., [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and  [[Balinese language|Balinese]]) with Indonesian. This results in various vernacular varieties of Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is amplified by the use of [[Indonesian slang]], particularly in the cities. Unlike the relatively uniform standard variety, Vernacular Indonesian exhibits a high degree of geographical variation, though Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian functions as the ''de facto'' norm of informal language and is a popular source of influence throughout the archipelago.<ref name=:0 />\n\nThe most common and widely used colloquial Indonesian is heavily influenced by the [[Betawi language]], a [[Malay trade and creole languages|Malay-based creole]] of [[Jakarta]], amplified by its popularity in Indonesian popular culture in mass media and Jakarta's status as the national capital. In informal spoken Indonesian, various words are replaced with those of a less formal nature. For example, {{lang|id|tidak}} (no) is often replaced with the Betawi form {{lang|id|nggak}} or the even simpler {{lang|id|gak}}, while {{lang|id|seperti}} (like, similar to) is often replaced with {{lang|jv|kayak}} {{IPA-ms|kaja\u0294|}}. {{lang|id|Sangat}} or {{lang|id|amat}} (very), the term to express intensity, is often being replaced with the Javanese-influenced {{lang|id|banget}}.\n\nAs for pronunciation, the diphthongs ''ai'' and ''au'' on the end of base words are typically pronounced as {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. In informal writing, the spelling of words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation in a way that can be produced with less effort. For example, {{lang|id|capai}} becomes {{lang|id|cape}} or {{lang|id|capek}}, {{lang|id|pakai}} becomes {{lang|id|pake}}, {{lang|id|kalau}} becomes {{lang|id|kalo}}.\n\nIn verbs, the prefix ''me-'' is often dropped, although an initial nasal consonant is often retained, as when {{lang|id|mengangkat}} becomes {{lang|id|ngangkat}} (the basic word is {{lang|id|angkat}}). The suffixes ''-kan'' and ''-i'' are often replaced by ''-in''. For example, {{lang|id|mencarikan}} becomes {{lang|id|nyariin}}, {{lang|id|menuruti}} becomes {{lang|id|nurutin}}. The latter grammatical aspect is one often closely related to the Indonesian spoken in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.\n\n== Classification and related languages ==\n{{See also|Austronesian languages#Cross-linguistic Comparison Chart}}\nIndonesian is one of the many varieties of [[Malay language|Malay]].

This status has made it relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnic languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group, and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as the previous coloniser. Compared to the indigenous dialects of [[Malay language|Malay]] spoken in Sumatra and Malay peninsula or the normative Malaysian standard, the Indonesian language differs profoundly by a large amount of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] loanwords incorporated into its already-rich vocabulary. As a result, Indonesian has more extensive sources of [[list of loan words in Indonesian|loanwords]], compared to Malaysian Malay. It is sometimes said that the Indonesian language is an artificial language, meaning that it was designed by academics rather than evolving naturally as most common languages have,<ref name=\"Interesting Thing of the Day\">{{cite web |url=http://itotd.com/articles/310/bahasa-indonesia/ |title=Bahasa Indonesia, The complex story of a simple language |date=17 September 2004 |publisher=Interesting Thing of the Day |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522155906/http://itotd.com/articles/310/bahasa-indonesia/ |archive-date=22 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> in order to accommodate the political purpose of establishing an official and unifying language of Indonesia.

This has been based more upon political nuance and the history of their standardisation than cultural reasons, and as a result, there are asymmetrical views regarding each other's variety among Malaysians and Indonesians. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different normative varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate, albeit closely related, languages. Consequently, Indonesians feel little need to harmonise their language with Malaysia and Brunei, whereas Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with Indonesians,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-455.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060400/http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-455.htm|archive-date=4 March 2016|title=Who is Malay?|date=July 2005}}</ref> although the 1972 [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|Indonesian alphabet reform]] was seen mainly as a concession of Dutch-based Indonesian to the English-based spelling of Malaysian.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{main|Malay phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nIt is usually said that there are six vowels in Indonesian.<ref name=\"SodOlson2008\" /> These six vowels are shown in the table below.

It is generally the penultimate syllable that is stressed, unless its vowel is a schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}}. If the penult has a schwa, then stress moves to the ante-penultimate syllable if there is one, even if that syllable has a schwa as well; if the word is disyllabic, the stress is final. In disyllabic stress with a closed penultimate syllable, such as ''tinggal'' ('stay') and ''rantai'' ('chain'), stress falls on the penult.\n\nHowever, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.<ref name=\"ClynesDet2011\" /><ref name=\"Zur2008\">{{cite journal |first1=Zuraidah |last1=Mohd Don |last2=Knowles |first2=G. |last3=Yong |first3=J. |year=2008 |title=How words can be misleading: A study of syllable timing and 'stress' in Malay |journal=The Linguistics Journal |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=https://www.linguistics-journal.com/2014/01/08/how-words-can-be-misleading-a-study-of-syllable-timing-and-stress-in-malay/ |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801235943/https://www.linguistics-journal.com/2014/01/08/how-words-can-be-misleading-a-study-of-syllable-timing-and-stress-in-malay/ |archive-date=1 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/11/abstracts/Gil.pdf |accessdate=25 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225063313/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/11/abstracts/Gil.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2012  |last=Gil |first=David |title=A Typology of Stress, And Where Malay/Indonesian Fits In}} (abstract only)</ref>\n\n=== Rhythm ===\nThe classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic.<ref>Roach, P. (1982). \"On the distinction between 'stress-timed' and 'syllable-timed' languages\".  In D. Crystal (ed.), ''Linguistic Controversies'' (pp.&nbsp;73\u201379). London: Edward Arnold.</ref> Nevertheless, acoustic measurements suggest that Indonesian has more syllable-based rhythm than British English,<ref>Deterding, D. (2011). \"Measurements of the rhythm of Malay\". In ''Proceedings of the 17th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, Hong Kong, 17\u201321 August 2011'', pp. 576\u2013579.

However considerable flexibility in word ordering exists, in contrast with languages such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Korean language|Korean]], for instance, which always end clauses with verbs. Indonesian, while allowing for relatively flexible word orderings, does not mark for [[grammatical case]], nor does it make use of [[grammatical gender]].\n\n=== Affixes ===\nIn Indonesian, affixes take on an important role because slightly different affixes may have very different meanings. There are four types of affixes: [[prefixes]] (''awalan''), [[suffixes]] (''akhiran''), [[circumfixes]] (''apitan'') and [[infixes]] (''sisipan''). Affixes are categorised into noun, verb, and adjective affixes. Root words are either nouns or verbs, which can take on affixes to generate new words, for example, ''masak'' (to cook) may become ''memasak'' (cooks), ''memasakkan'' (cooks for), ''dimasak'' (is cooked), ''pemasak'' (a cook), ''masakan'' (a meal, cookery), \u2018\u2019termasak\u2019\u2019 (accidentally cooked). Many initial consonants alternate in the presence of prefixes: ''sapu'' (to sweep) becomes ''menyapu'' (sweeps/sweeping); ''panggil'' (to call) becomes ''memanggil'' (calls/calling), ''tapis'' (to sieve) becomes ''menapis'' (sieves).\n\nOther examples of the use of [[affix]]es to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word ''ajar'' (teach):\n* ''ajar'' = teach\n* '' ajar'''an''''' = teachings\n* '' '''bel'''ajar'' = to learn\n* '' '''meng'''ajar'' = to teach ([[intransitive verb|intransitive]])\n* '' '''meng'''ajar'''kan''''' = to teach ([[transitive verb|transitive]])\n* '' '''di'''ajar'' = to be taught (intransitive)\n* '' '''di'''ajar'''kan''''' = to be taught (transitive)\n* '' '''mempel'''ajar'''i''''' = to study\n* '' '''dipel'''ajar'''i''''' = to be studied\n* '' '''pel'''ajar'' = student\n* '' '''peng'''ajar'' = teacher\n* '' '''pel'''ajar'''an''''' = subject, education\n* '' '''peng'''ajar'''an''''' = lesson\n* '' '''pembel'''ajar'''an''''' = learning\n* '' '''ter'''ajar'' = taught (accidentally)\n* '' '''terpel'''ajar'' = well-educated, literally \"been taught\"\n* '' '''berpel'''ajar'''an''''' = is educated, literally \"has education\"\n\n==== Noun affixes ====\nNoun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Type of noun affixes\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Affix\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of root word\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of derived word\n|-\n|Prefix\n|p\u0259(r)- ~ p\u0259ng-\n|''duduk'' (sit)\n|'''''pen'''duduk'' (population)\n|-\n|\n|k\u0259-\n|''hendak'' (want)\n|'''''ke'''hendak'' (desire)\n|-\n|Infix\n| {{angbr|\u0259l}}\n|''tunjuk'' (point)\n|''t'''el'''unjuk'' (index finger, command)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259m}}\n|''kelut'' (dishevelled)\n|''k'''em'''elut'' (chaos, crisis)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259r}}\n|''gigi'' (teeth)\n|''g'''er'''igi'' (toothed blade)\n|-\n|Suffix\n| -an\n|''bangun'' (wake up, raise)\n|''bangun'''an''''' (building)\n|-\n|Circumfix\n|k\u0259-...-an\n|''raja'' (king)\n|'''''ke'''raja'''an''''' (kingdom)\n|-\n|\n|p\u0259(r)-...-an<br />p\u0259ng-...-an\n|''kerja'' (work)\n|'''''pe'''kerja'''an''''' (occupation)\n|}\n\nThe prefix ''per-'' drops its ''r'' before ''r, l'' and frequently before ''p, t, k.'' In some words it is ''peng-''; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Indonesian grammar books.\n\n==== Verb affixes ====\nSimilarly, verb affixes in Indonesian are attached to root words to form verbs. In Indonesian, there are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Type of verb affixes\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Affix\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of root word\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of derived word\n|-\n|Prefix\n|b\u0259r-\n|''ajar'' (teach)\n|''belajar'' (to study)<ref>The root ''ajar'' retrieves a historic initial ''l'' after the suffixes ''ber-'' and ''pe(r)-''.</ref>\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259ng-\n|''tolong'' (help)\n|''menolong'' (to help)\n|-\n|\n|di-\n|''ambil'' (take)\n|''diambil'' (be taken)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259mp\u0259r-\n|''panjang'' (length)\n|''memperpanjang'' (to lengthen)\n|-\n|\n|dip\u0259r-\n|''dalam'' (deep)\n|''diperdalam'' (be deepened)\n|-\n|\n|t\u0259r-\n|''makan'' (eat)\n|''termakan'' (to have accidentally eaten)\n|-\n|Suffix\n| -kan\n|''letak'' (place, keep)\n|''letakkan'' (keep, put)\n|-\n|\n| -i\n|''jauh'' (far)\n|''jauhi'' (avoid)\n|-\n|Circumfix\n|b\u0259r-...-an\n|''pasang'' (pair)\n|''berpasangan'' (in pairs)\n|-\n|\n|b\u0259r-...-kan\n|''dasar'' (base)\n|''berdasarkan'' (based on)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259ng-...-kan\n|''pasti'' (sure)\n|''memastikan'' (to make sure)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259ng-...-i\n|''teman'' (company)\n|''menemani'' (to accompany)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259mp\u0259r-...-kan\n|''guna'' (use)\n|''mempergunakan'' (to utilise, to exploit)\n|-\n|\n|m\u0259mp\u0259r-...-i\n|''ajar'' (teach)\n|''mempelajari'' (to study)\n|-\n|\n|k\u0259-...-an\n|''hilang'' (disappear)\n|''kehilangan'' (to lose)\n|-\n|\n|di-...-i\n|''sakit'' (pain)\n|''disakiti'' (to be hurt by)\n|-\n|\n|di-...-kan\n|''benar'' (right)\n|''dibenarkan'' (is allowed to)\n|-\n|\n|dip\u0259r-...-kan\n|''kenal'' (know, recognise)\n|''diperkenalkan'' (is being introduced)\n|}\n\n==== Adjective affixes ====\nAdjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Type of adjective affixes\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Affix\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of root word\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Example of derived word\n|-\n|Prefix\n|t\u0259r-\n|''kenal'' (know)\n|''terkenal'' (famous)\n|-\n|\n|s\u0259-\n|''lari'' (run)\n|''selari'' (parallel)\n|-\n|Infix\n| {{angbr|\u0259l}}\n|''serak'' (disperse)\n|''selerak'' (messy)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259m}}\n|''cerlang'' (radiant bright)\n|''cemerlang'' (bright, excellent)\n|-\n|\n| {{angbr|\u0259r}}\n|''sabut'' (husk)\n|''serabut'' (dishevelled)\n|-\n|Circumfix\n|k\u0259-...-an\n|''barat'' (west)\n|''kebaratan'' (westernised)\n|}\n\nIn addition to these affixes, Indonesian also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, ''maha-'', ''pasca-'', ''eka-'', ''bi-'', ''anti-'', ''pro-'' etc.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nCommon derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterised by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result).\n\n==== Gender ====\nIndonesian does not make use of [[grammatical gender]], and there are only selected words that use natural [[gender]]. For instance, the same word is used for ''he/him'' and ''she/her'' ({{lang|id|dia}} or {{lang|id|ia}}) or for ''his'' and ''her'' ({{lang|id|dia}}, {{lang|id|ia}} or {{lang|id|-nya}}). No real distinction is made between \"girlfriend\" and \"boyfriend\", both {{lang|id|pacar}} (although more colloquial terms as {{lang|id|cewek}} girl/girlfriend and {{lang|id|cowok}} boy/boyfriend can also be found). A majority of Indonesian words that refer to people generally have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. However, unlike English, distinction is made between older or younger.\n\nThere are some words that have gender, for instance {{lang|id|putri}} means \"daughter\", and {{lang|id|putra}} means \"son\" and also {{lang|id|pramugara}} means \"male flight attendant\" and {{lang|id|pramugari}} meaning \"female flight attendant\". Another example would be {{lang|id|olahragawan}}, which equates to \"sportsman\", and {{lang|id|olahragawati}}, meaning sportswoman. Often, words like these (or certain suffixes such as \"-a\" and \"-i\" or \"-wan\" and \"wati\") are absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from [[Sanskrit]] through the Old [[Javanese language]]).\nIn some regions of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Jakarta, {{lang|id|abang}} (a gender-specific term meaning \"older brother\") is commonly used as a form of address for older siblings/males, while {{lang|id|kakak}} (a non-gender specific term meaning \"older sibling\") is often used to mean \"older sister\". Similarly, more direct influences from other languages, such as Javanese and Chinese, have also seen further use of other gendered words in Indonesian. For example: {{lang|jv|Mas}} (\"older brother\"), {{lang|jv|Mbak}} (\"older sister\"), {{lang|jv|Koko}} (\"older brother\") and {{lang|jv|Cici}} (\"older sister\").\n\n==== Number ====\nIndonesian grammar does not regularly mark [[plural]]s. In Indonesian, to change a singular into a plural one either repeats the word or adds ''para'' before it (the latter for living things only); for example, \"students\" can be either {{lang|id|murid-murid}} or {{lang|id|para murid}}. Plurals are rarely used in Indonesian, especially in informal parlance. Reduplication is often mentioned as the formal way to express the plural form of nouns in Indonesian; however, in informal daily [[discourse]], speakers of Indonesian usually use other [[Methodology|methods]] to indicate the [[concept]] of something being \"more than one\". Reduplication may also indicate the conditions of variety and diversity as well, and not simply plurality.\n\n[[Reduplication]] is commonly used to emphasise plurality; however, reduplication has many other functions. For example, ''orang-orang'' means \"(all the) people\", but ''orang-orangan'' means \"scarecrow\". Similarly, while ''hati'' means \"heart\" or \"liver\", ''hati-hati'' is a verb meaning \"to be careful\". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as ''orang-orangan'' \"scarecrow/scarecrows\", ''biri-biri'' \"a/some sheep\" and ''kupu-kupu'' \"butterfly/butterflies\". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in ''sayur-mayur'' \"(all sorts of) vegetables\".\n\nDistributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: ''pohon'' \"tree\", ''pepohonan'' \"[[flora]], trees\"; ''rumah'' \"house\", ''perumahan'' \"housing, houses\"; ''gunung'' \"mountain\", ''pegunungan'' \"mountain range, mountains\".\n\nQuantity words come before the noun: ''seribu orang'' \"a thousand people\", ''beberapa pegunungan'' \"a series of mountain ranges\", ''beberapa kupu-kupu'' \"some butterflies\".\n\nPlural in Indonesian serves just to explicitly mention the number of objects in sentence. For example, ''Ani membeli satu kilo mangga'' (Ani buys one kilogram of mangoes). In this case, \"mangoes\", which is plural, is not said as ''mangga-mangga'' because the plurality is implicit: the [[amount]] '''a kilogram''' means more than one mango. So, as it is logically, one does not change the singular into the plural form, because it is not necessary and considered a [[pleonasm]] (in Indonesian often called ''pemborosan kata'').\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nPersonal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say \"you\". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (\"does Johnny want to go?\", \"would Madam like to go?\"); kin terms, including [[fictive kinship]], are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns ''ini'' \"this, the\" and ''itu'' \"that, the\".\n\n==== Personal pronouns ====\nFrom the perspective of a European language, Indonesian boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker.\n\nThis table shows an overview over the most commonly and widely used pronouns of the Indonesian language:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common pronouns\n|-\n! width=75 |person\n! width=75 |\n! width=75 |respect\n! width=75 |singular\n! width=100 |plural\n|-\n! rowspan=3|1st person\n! rowspan=2|<small>exclusive</small>\n!<small>informal, familiar</small>\n| align=center|''aku''\n| rowspan=2 align=center|''kami''<br /><small>(we: they and me, she/he and me)</small>\n|-\n!<small>standard, polite</small>\n| align=center|''saya''\n|-\n!<small>inclusive</small>\n|\n|\n| align=center|''kita''<br /><small>(we: you and me, you and us)</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 2nd person\n|\n!<small>familiar</small>\n| align=center|''kamu'', ''engkau'', or ''kau''\n| align=center|''kalian''<br /><small>(you all)</small>\n|-\n|\n!<small>polite</small>\n| align=center|''Anda''<br /><small>(you)</small>\n| align=center|''Anda sekalian''<br /><small>(you all)</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | 3rd person\n| \n!<small>familiar</small>\n| align=center|''dia'' or ''ia''\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |''mereka'' <br /><small>(they)</small>\n|-\n| \n!<small>polite</small>\n| align=center|''Beliau''<br /><small>(he/she)</small>\n|}\n* '''First person pronouns'''\nNotable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between [[inclusive and exclusive we|two forms of \"we\"]]: ''kita'' (you and me, you and us) and ''kami'' (us, but not you). The distinction is not always followed in colloquial Indonesian.\n\n''Saya'' and ''aku'' are the two major forms of \"I\". ''Saya'' is the more formal form, whereas ''aku'' is used with family, friends, and between lovers. ''Sahaya'' is an old or literary form of ''saya''. ''Sa(ha)ya'' may also be used for \"we\", but in such cases it is usually used with ''sekalian'' or ''semua'' \"all\"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive ''kami'' or exclusive ''kita''. Less common are ''hamba'' \"slave\", ''hamba tuan, hamba datuk'' (all extremely humble), ''beta'' (a royal addressing oneselves), ''patik'' (a commoner addressing a royal), ''kami'' (royal or editorial \"we\"), ''kita'', ''t\u0259man'', and ''kawan.''\n* '''Second person pronouns'''\nThere are three common forms of \"you\", ''Anda'' (polite), ''kamu'' (familiar), and ''kalian'' \"all\" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). ''Anda'' is used with strangers, recent acquaintances, in advertisements, in business, and when you wish to show respect (though terms like ''tuan'' \"sir\" and other titles also show respect), while ''kamu'' is used in situations where the speaker would use ''aku'' for \"I\". ''Anda sekalian'' is polite plural.\n\n''Engkau'' (''\u0259ngkau''), commonly shortened to ''kau'', and ''hang'' are used to social inferiors, ''awak'' to equals, and ''\u0259ncik'' (''cek'' before a name) is polite, traditionally used for people without title. The compounds ''makcik'' and ''pakcik'' are used with village elders one is well acquainted with or the guest of.\n* '''Third person pronouns'''\nThe common word for \"s/he\" and \"they\" is ''ia'', which has the object and emphatic/focused form ''dia''. ''B\u0259liau'' \"his/her Honour\" is respectful. As with \"you\", names and kin terms are extremely common. ''Mereka'' \"someone\", ''mereka itu'', or ''orang itu'' \"those people\" are used for \"they\".\n* '''Regional varieties'''\nThere are a large number of other words for \"I\" and \"you\", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. ''Saudara'' \"you\" (male) and ''saudari'' (female) (plural ''saudara-saudara'' or ''saudari-saudari'') show utmost respect. ''Daku'' \"I\" and ''dikau'' \"you\" are poetic or romantic. Indonesian ''[[Indonesian slang language|gua]]'' \"I\" (from [[Hokkien]] {{zh|t=\u6211|poj=g\u00f3a}}) and ''[[Indonesian slang language|lu]]'' \"you\" ({{zh|t=\u6c5d|poj=l\u00fa}}) are slang and extremely informal.\n\nThe pronouns ''aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,'' and ''kita'' are indigenous to Indonesian.\n\n==== Possessive pronouns ====\n''Aku, kamu, engkau'', and ''ia'' have short possessive [[enclitic]] forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic ''dia'': ''meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia'' \"my table, our table, your table, his/her table\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Possessed forms of ''meja'' \"table\"\n! Pronoun\n! Enclitic\n! Possessed form\n|-\n|aku\n| -ku\n|''mejaku'' (my table)\n|-\n|kamu\n| -mu\n|''mejamu'' (your table)\n|-\n|ia\n| -nya\n|''mejanya'' (his, her, their table)\n|}\n\nThere are also [[proclitic]] forms of ''aku'', ''ku-'' and ''kau-''. These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:\n\n:'''''Ku'''-dengar raja itu menderita penyakit kulit. '''Aku''' mengetahui ilmu kedokteran. '''Aku-lah''' yang akan mengobati dia.''\n:\"It has come to my attention that the King has a skin disease. I am skilled in medicine. ''I'' will cure him.\"\nHere ''ku-''verb is used for a general report, ''aku'' verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic ''aku-lah meng-''verb (\u2248 \"I am the one who...\") for focus on the pronoun.<ref>M.B. Lewis, 1947, ''Teach Yourself Indonesian'', p. 178, ASIN: B0007JGNQO</ref>\n\n==== Demonstrative pronouns ====\nThere are two [[demonstrative pronoun]]s in Indonesian. ''Ini'' \"this, these\" is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. ''Itu'' \"that, those\" is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English \"the\". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a ''ini'' or ''itu''. The word ''yang'' \"which\" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/ someone, like English \"this one\" or \"that one\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun\n! Indonesian\n! English\n|-\n! rowspan=2|ini\n| ''buku ini''\n| This book, these books, the book(s)\n|-\n| ''buku-buku ini''\n| These books, (all) the books\n|-\n! rowspan=2| itu\n| ''kucing itu''\n| That cat, those cats, the cat(s)\n|-\n| ''kucing-kucing itu''\n| Those cats, the (various) cats\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote [[voice (grammar)|voice]] or intentional and accidental [[grammatical mood|moods]]. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.\n\nExamples of these are the prefixes ''di-'' ([[Austronesian alignment|patient focus]], traditionally called \n\"passive voice\", with OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in the first or second persons), ''meng-'' ([[Austronesian alignment|agent focus]], traditionally called \n\"active voice\", with AVO word order), ''memper-'' and ''diper-'' ([[causative]], agent and patient focus), ''ber-'' ([[stative verb|stative]] or habitual; intransitive VS order), and ''ter-'' (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes ''-kan'' (causative or [[benefactive]]) and ''-i'' (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes ''ber-...-an'' ([[pluractionality|plural subject, diffuse action]]) and ''ke-...-an'' (unintentional or potential action or state).\n\n* ''duduk'' to sit down\n* ''mendudukkan'' to sit someone down, give someone a seat, to appoint\n* ''menduduki'' to sit on, to occupy\n* ''didudukkan'' to be given a seat, to be appointed\n* ''diduduki'' to be sat on, to be occupied\n* ''terduduk'' to sink down, to come to sit\n* ''kedudukan'' to be situated\n\nForms in ''ter-'' and ''ke-...-an'' are often equivalent to adjectives in English.\n\n==== Negation ====\nFour words are used for negation in Indonesian, namely ''tidak'', ''bukan'', ''jangan'', and ''belum''.\n\n* '''''Tidak''''' (not), often shortened to '''''tak''''', is used for the negation of verbs and \"adjectives\".\n* '''''Bukan''''' (be-not) is used in the negation of a noun.\nFor example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Indonesian\n!Gloss\n!English\n|-\n|''Saya '''tidak''' tahu'' (Saya '''tak''' tahu)\n|I '''not''' know\n|I do '''not''' know\n|-\n|''Ibu saya '''tidak''' senang'' (Ibu saya '''tak''' senang)\n|mother I '''not''' be-happy\n|My mother is '''not''' happy\n|-\n|''Itu '''bukan''' anjing saya''\n|that '''be-not''' dog I\n|That '''is not''' my dog\n|}\n\n==== Prohibition ====\nFor negating imperatives or advising against certain actions in Indonesian, the word ''jangan'' (do not) is used before the verb. For example,\n*  '''''Jangan''''' tinggalkan saya di sini!\n:'''Don't''' leave me here!\n*  '''''Jangan''''' lakukan itu!\n:'''Don't''' do that!\n*  '''''Jangan'''''! Itu tidak bagus untukmu.\n:'''Don't!''' That's not good for you.\n\n=== Adjectives ===\nThere are grammatical adjectives in Indonesian. [[Stative verb]]s are often used for this purpose as well. Adjectives are always placed after the noun that they modify. Hence, \"rumah saya\" means \"my house\", while \"saya rumah\" means \"I am a house\". \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Indonesian\n!Gloss\n!English\n|-\n|''Hutan hijau''\n|forest green\n|(The) green forest.\n|-\n|''Hutan itu hijau''\n|forest that green\n|That/the forest is green.\n|-\n|''K\u0259reta yang merah''\n|carriage which (is) red.\n|(The) carriage which is red = the red carriage.\n|-\n|''K\u0259reta merah''\n|carriage red.\n|Red carriage.\n|-\n|''Dia orang yang terkenal sekali''\n|he/she person which be-famous very\n|He/she is a very famous person\n|-\n|''Orang terkenal''\n|person famous.\n|Famous person.\n|-\n|''Orang ini terkenal sekali''\n|person this be-famous very\n|This person is very famous\n|}\n\nTo say that something \"is\" an adjective, the determiners \"itu\" and \"ini\" (\"that\" and \"this\") are often used. For example, in the sentence \"anjing itu galak\", the use of \"itu\" gives a meaning of \"the/that dog is ferocious\", while \"anjing ini galak\", gives a meaning of \"this dog is ferocious\". However, if \"itu\" or \"ini\" were not to be used, then \"anjing galak\" would meaning only \"ferocious dog\", a plain adjective without any stative implications. The all-purpose determiner, \"yang\", is also often used before adjectives, hence \"anjing yang galak\" also means \"ferocious dog\" or more literally \"dog which is ferocious\"; \"yang\" will often be used for clarity. Hence, in a sentence such as \"saya didekati oleh anjing galak\" which means \"I was approached by a ferocious dog\", the use of the adjective \"galak\" is not stative at all.\n\nOften the \"ber-\" intransitive verb prefix, or the \"ter-\" stative prefix is used to express the meaning of \"to be...\". For example, \"beda\" means \"different\", hence \"berbeda\" means \"to be different\"; \"awan\" means \"cloud\", hence \"berawan\" means \"cloudy\". Using the \"ter-\" prefix, implies a state of being. For example, \"buka\" means \"open\", hence \"terbuka\" means \"is opened\"; \"tutup\" means \"closed/shut\", hence \"tertutup\" means \"is closed/shut\".\n\n=== Word order ===\nAdjectives, [[demonstrative]] determiners, and [[possessive]] determiners follow the noun they modify.\n\nIndonesian does not have a [[grammatical subject]] in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and an [[object (grammar)|object]], these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.\n\nEither the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:\n\n;1) Adding a sense of politeness and respect to a statement or question\n\nFor example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ellipses of pronoun (agent & object)\n! Literal English\n! Idiomatic English\n|-\n| Bisa ''dibantu?''\n| Can + ''to be helped''?\n| Can (I) ''help'' (you)?\n|}\n\n;2) Agent or object is unknown, not important, or understood from context\n\nFor example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ellipses of pronoun (understood agent)\n! Literal English\n! Idiomatic English\n|-\n| ''Rumah ini '''dibeli''' lima tahun yang lalu''\n| House this + ''be purchased'' five-year(s) ago\n| The house 'was purchased' five years ago\n|}\n\nUltimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.\n\n==== Emphasis ====\nWord order is frequently modified for [[focus (grammar)|focus]] or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]):\n\n* ''Saya pergi ke pasar kemarin'' \"I went to the market yesterday\" \u2013 neutral, or with focus on the subject.\n* ''Kemarin saya pergi ke pasar'' \"Yesterday I went to the market\" \u2013 emphasis on yesterday.\n* ''Ke pasar saya pergi, kemarin'' \"To the market I went yesterday\" \u2013 emphasis on where I went yesterday.\n* ''Pergi ke pasar, saya, kemarin'' \"To the market went I yesterday\" \u2013 emphasis on the process of going to the market.\n\nThe last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.\n\n=== Measure words ===\nAnother distinguishing feature of Indonesian is its use of [[measure word]]s, also called [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] (''kata penggolong''). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]].\n\nMeasure words are also found in English such as ''two head of cattle'', ''a loaf of bread'', or ''this sheet of paper'', where ''*two cattle, a bread,'' and ''this paper'' (in the sense of ''this piece of paper'') would be ungrammatical. The word ''satu'' reduces to ''se-'' {{IPA|/s\u0259/}}, as it does in other compounds:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Measure word\n! Used for measuring\n! Literal translation\n! Example\n|-\n| buah\n| things (in general), large things, abstract nouns<br />houses, cars, ships, mountains; books, rivers, chairs, some fruits, thoughts, etc.\n| 'fruit'\n| dua buah meja (two tables), lima buah rumah (five houses)\n|-\n| ekor \n| animals\n| 'tail'\n| seekor ayam (a chicken), tiga ekor kambing (three goats)\n|-\n| orang\n| human beings\n| 'person'\n| seorang laki-laki (a man), enam orang petani (six farmers), seratus orang murid (a hundred students)\n|-\n| biji\n| smaller rounded objects<br />most fruits, cups, nuts\n| 'grain'\n| sebiji/ sebutir telur (an egg), sebutir/ butiran-butiran beras (rice or rices)\n|-\n| batang\n| long stiff things<br />trees, walking sticks, pencils\n| 'trunk, rod'\n| sebatang tongkat (a stick)\n|-\n| h\u0259lai\n| things in thin layers or sheets<br />paper, cloth, feathers, hair\n| 'leaf'\n| sepuluh helai pakaian (ten cloths)\n|-\n| k\u0259ping keping\n| flat fragments slabs of stone, pieces of wood, pieces of bread, land, coins, paper \n| 'chip'\n|sekeping uang logam (a coin)\n|-\n| pucuk\n| letters, firearms, needles\n| 'sprout'\n| sepucuk senjata (a weapon)\n|-\n| bilah\n| things which cut lengthwise and thicker\n| 'blade'\n| sebilah kayu (a piece of wood)\n|-\n| bidan\u0261 \n| things which can be measured with number \n| 'field'\n| sebidang tanah/lahan (an area)  \n|-\n| potong \n|bread\n|'cut'\n|sepotong roti (slices of bread)\n|-\n| utas \n|nets, cords, ribbons\n| 'thread'\n|seutas tali (a rope)\n|-\n| carik \n|things easily torn, like paper \n|'shred'\n|secarik kertas (a piece of paper)\n|}\n\n''Example'':\nMeasure words are not necessary just to say \"a\": ''burung'' \"a bird, birds\". Using ''se-'' plus a measure word is closer to English \"one\" or \"a certain\":\n:''Ada seekor burung yang bisa berbicara''\n:\"There was a (certain) bird that could talk\"\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Indonesian alphabet|Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System}}\n\nIndonesian is written with the [[Latin script]]. It was originally based on the [[Dutch spelling]] and still bears some similarities to it. Consonants are represented in a way similar to [[Italian language#Writing system|Italian]], although {{angle bracket|c}} is always {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (like English {{angle bracket|ch}}), {{angle bracket|g}} is always {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (\"hard\") and {{angle bracket|j}} represents {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} as it does in English. In addition, {{angle bracket|ny}} represents the [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{angle bracket|ng}} is used for the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (which can occur word-initially), {{angle bracket|sy}} for {{IPA|/\u0283/}} (English {{angle bracket|sh}}) and {{angle bracket|kh}} for the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}. Both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}} are represented with {{angle bracket|e}}.\n\nSpelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Phoneme!!Obsolete<br />spelling!!Modern<br />spelling\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|u}}||oe||u\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|t\u0283}}||tj||c\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|d\u0292}}||dj||j\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|j}}||j||y\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|\u0272}}||nj||ny\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|\u0283}}||sj||sy\n|-align=\"center\"\n|{{IPAslink|x}}||ch||kh\n|}\n\nIntroduced in 1901, the [[van Ophuijsen Spelling System|''van Ophuijsen'' system]], (named from the advisor of the system, Charles Adriaan van Ophuijsen) was the first standardisation of romanised spelling. It was most influenced by the then current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling system]]. In 1947, the spelling was changed into ''[[Republican Spelling System|Republican Spelling]]'' or ''Soewandi Spelling'' (named by at the time Minister of Education, Soewandi). This spelling changed formerly spelled ''oe'' into ''u'' (however, the spelling influenced other aspects in orthography, for example writing reduplicated words). All of the other changes were a part of the [[Perfected Spelling System]], an officially mandated [[spelling reform]] in 1972. Some of the old spellings (which were derived from [[Dutch orthography]]) do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of Indonesia is still sometimes written ''[[Suharto|Soeharto]]'', and the central Java city of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] is sometimes written ''Jogjakarta''.

It is estimated that there are some 750 Sanskrit loanwords in modern Indonesian, 1,000 Arabic loans, some of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] origin, some 125 words of Portuguese, some of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] origin, and 10,000 loanwords from Dutch.<ref>This is research led by Prof. Dr. J.

The words were either borrowed directly from India or with the intermediary of the [[Old Javanese language]]. Although [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, [[Sanskrit]], which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of [[Latin]] in [[English language|English]] and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for [[neologism]]s, these are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of [[religion]], [[art]] and everyday life.\n\nFrom [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] came such words as \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917 ''surga'' (heaven), \u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e ''bahasa'' (language), \u0915\u093e\u091a ''kaca'' (glass, mirror), \u0930\u093e\u091c- ''raja'' (king), \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f ''manusia'' (mankind), \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e ''cinta'' (love), \u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f ''bumi'' (earth), \u092d\u0941\u0935\u0928 ''buana'' (world), \u0906\u0917\u092e ''agama'' (religion), \u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 ''Istri'' (wife/woman), \u091c\u092f ''Jaya'' (victory/victorious), \u092a\u0941\u0930 ''Pura'' (city/temple/place) \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938 ''[[Raksasa]]'' (giant/monster), \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e ''[[Dharma]]'' (rule/regulations), \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 ''[[Mantra]]'' (words/poet/spiritual prayers), \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f ''Satria'' (warrior/brave/soldier), \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f ''Wijaya'' (greatly victorious/great victory), etc. [[Sanskrit]] words and sentences are also used in names, titles, and mottos of the Indonesian National Police and Indonesian Armed Forces such as: ''[[Indonesian National Police|Bhayangkara]]'', ''[[Laksamana]]'', ''[[Jatayu]]'', ''[[Garuda]]'', ''Dharmakerta Marga Reksyaka'', ''[[Indonesian Navy|Jalesveva Jayamahe]]'', ''[[Indonesian Army|Kartika Eka Paksi]]'', ''[[Indonesian Air Force|Swa Bhuwana Paksa]]'', ''[[Indonesian National Police|Rastra Sewakottama]]'', ''Yudha Siaga'', etc.\n\nBecause [[Sanskrit]] has long been known in the [[Indonesian archipelago]], Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign. Therefore, one could write a short story using only Sanskrit words. The short story below consists of approximately 80 words in Indonesian that are written using Sanskrit words alone, except for a few particles.\n\n:'''''[[wikt:karena|Karena]]''' '''[[wikt:semua|semua]]''' di'''[[wikt:biaya|biaya]]'''i '''[[wikt:dana|dana]]''' '''[[wikt:negara|negara]]''' '''[[wikt:juta|juta]]'''an '''[[wikt:rupiah|rupiah]]''', sang '''[[wikt:mahaguru|mahaguru]]''' '''[[wikt:sastra|sastra]] [[wikt:bahasa|bahasa]] [[wikt:Kawi|Kawi]]''' dan '''[[wikt:mahasiswa|mahasiswa]]-[[wikt:mahasiswi|mahasiswi]]'''nya, '''[[wikt:duta|duta]]-[[wikt:duta|duta]] [[wikt:negeri|negeri]] [[wikt:mitra|mitra]], [[wikt:Menteri|Menteri]]''' Ke'''[[wikt:budaya|budaya]]'''an dan '''[[wikt:Pariwisata|Pariwisata]] [[wikt:suami|suami]]-[[wikt:istri|istri]]''', be'''[[wikt:serta|serta]] [[wikt:karyawan|karyawan]]-[[wikt:karyawati|karyawati]] [[wikt:lembaga|lembaga]] [[wikt:nirlaba|nirlaba]] [[wikt:segera|segera]]''' ber'''[[wikt:dharmawisata|dharmawisata]]''' ke pe'''[[wikt:desa|desa]]'''an di '''[[wikt:utara|utara]] [[wikt:kota|kota]]''' ka'''[[wikt:bupati|bupate]]'''n '''[[wikt:Probolinggo|Probolinggo]] [[wikt:antara|antara]] [[wikt:candi|candi]]-[[wikt:candi|candi]] [[wikt:purba|purba]]''', ber'''[[wikt:wahana|wahana]] [[wikt:keledai|keledai]]''' di '''[[wikt:kala|kala]] [[wikt:senja|senja]]''' dan ber'''[[wikt:sama|sama]] [[wikt:kepala|kepala]] [[wikt:desa|desa]]''' me'''[[wikt:saksi|nyaksi]]'''kan '''[[wikt:para|para]] [[wikt:tani|tani]]''' yang ber'''[[wikt:jiwa|jiwa]]''' ber'''[[wikt:sahaja|sahaja]] [[wikt:serta|serta]]''' ber'''[[wikt:budi|budi]] [[wikt:nirmala|nirmala]]''' se'''[[wikt:cara|cara]]''' ber'''[[wikt:bahagia|bahagia]]''' ber'''[[wikt:upacara|upacara]], [[wikt:seraya|seraya]] [[wikt:merdu|merdu]]''' me'''[[wikt:suara|nyuara]]'''kan '''[[wikt:gita|gita]]-[[wikt:gita|gita]] [[wikt:mantra|mantra]]''', yang me'''[[wikt:rupa|rupa]]'''kan '''[[wikt:sarana|sarana]] [[wikt:puji|puji]]'''an mereka me'''[[wikt:puja|muja]] [[wikt:nama|nama]] [[wikt:suci|suci]] [[wikt:Pertiwi|Pertiwi]], [[wikt:Dewi|Dewi]] [[wikt:Bumi|Bumi]]''' yang ber'''[[wikt:sedia|sedia]]''' meng'''[[wikt:anugerah|anugerah]]'''i mereka '''[[wikt:karunia|karunia]]''' dan '''[[wikt:restu|restu]]''', me'''[[wikt:raksa|raksa]]''' dari '''[[wikt:bahaya|bahaya]], [[wikt:mala|mala]] [[wikt:petaka|petaka]]''' dan '''[[wikt:bencana|bencana]]'''.''\n\n=== Loan words of Chinese origin ===\n{{see also|List of Chinese loanwords in Indonesian}}\nThe relationship with China has been going since the 7th century when Chinese merchants traded in some areas of the archipelago such as [[Riau]], [[West Borneo]], [[East Kalimantan]], and [[North Maluku]]. At the kingdom of Srivijaya appeared and flourished, China opened diplomatic relations with the kingdom in order to secure trade and seafaring. In 922, Chinese travelers visited [[Kahuripan]] in [[East Java]]. Since the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants left [[Mainland China]] and settled in many parts of Nusantara (now called Indonesia).\n\nThe [[Chinese language|Chinese]] loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just things exclusively Chinese. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying [[Hokkien]]/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as [[Traditional characters|traditional]] and [[simplified characters]]) include ''pisau'' (\u5315\u9996 b\u01d0sh\u01d2u &nbsp;\u2013 knife), ''loteng'', (\u6a13/\u5c64 = l\u00f3u/c\u00e9ng&nbsp;\u2013 [upper] floor/ level), ''mie'' (\u9eb5 > \u9762 Hokkien m\u012b&nbsp;\u2013 noodles), ''[[lumpia]]'' (\u6f64\u9905 (Hokkien = l\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f)&nbsp;\u2013 springroll), ''cawan'' (\u8336\u7897 ch\u00e1w\u01cen&nbsp;\u2013 teacup), ''teko'' (\u8336\u58fa > \u8336\u58f6 = ch\u00e1h\u00fa [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), \u82e6\u529b kuli = \u82e6 khu (hard) and \u529b li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms ''gua'' and ''lu'' (from the Hokkien 'goa' \u6211 and 'lu/li' \u6c5d&nbsp;\u2013 meaning 'I/ me' and 'you').\n\n=== Loan words of Arabic origin ===\n[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Istiqlal-Mosque-03.jpg|thumb|The word ''masjid'' (mosque) in Indonesian derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|masjid}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f|rtl=yes}}).]]\nMany Arabic words were brought and spread by merchants from [[Arab Peninsula]] like [[Arabian people|Arabian]], [[Persian people|Persian]], and from the western part of India, [[Gujarat]] where many Muslims lived.<ref name=\"catdir.loc.gov\">{{Cite book |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98020577.pdf |title=Shifting Languages: Interaction and Identity in Javanese Indonesia |chapter=Introduction |first=J.

[[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}}), as it is mostly the case for [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]] speakers, is the word for [[God]] even in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to [[Greek language|Greek]] names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name [[Jesus]] was initially translated as ''<nowiki/>'Isa'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u064a\u0633\u0649}}), but is now spelt as ''Yesus''. Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language. Indonesian word for ''[[bishop]]'' is ''uskup'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0623\u0633\u0642\u0641}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|usquf}}'' = bishop). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for [[archbishop]] ''uskup agung'' (literally ''great bishop''), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term ''imam'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|im\u0101m}}'' = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic [[priest]], beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation ''jemaat'' (from {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|jam\u0101\u02bba}}'' = group, a community). Even the name of the [[Bible]] in Indonesian translation is ''Alkitab'' (from {{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|al-kit\u0101b}}'' = the book), which literally means \"the Book\".\n\n=== Loan words of Portuguese origin ===\n[[File:Front gate Ganjuran.jpg|thumb|Indonesian word \"''[[wikt:gereja|Gereja]]''\" (Church) is derived from Portuguese \"''[[wikt:igreja|Igreja]]''\". The sign reads: [[Ganjuran Church|\"''Gereja & Candi Hati Kudus Tuhan Yesus Ganjuran Keuskupan Agung Semarang''\"]] (The Church and [[Temple]] of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] Ganjuran [[Archdiocese of Semarang]]).]]\nAlongside [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail eastwards to the \"[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]\". Loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian words derived from Portuguese include ''meja'' (from mesa = table), ''bangku'' (from banco = bench), ''lemari/almari'' (from arm\u00e1rio = closet), ''boneka'' (from boneca = doll), ''jendela'' (from janela = window), ''Gereja'' (from Igreja = Church), ''Misa'' (from Missa = Mass), ''Natal'' (from Natal = Christmas), ''Paskah'' (from P\u00e1scoa = Easter), ''pesta'' (from festa = party), ''dansa'' (from dan\u00e7a = dance), ''pesiar'' (from passear = cruise), ''bendera'' (from bandeira = flag), ''sepatu'' (from sapato = shoes), ''garpu'' (from garfo = fork), ''kemeja'' (from camisa = shirt), ''kereta'' (from carreta = chariot), ''pompa'' (from bomba hidr\u00e1ulica = pump), ''pigura'' (from figura = picture), ''roda'' (from roda = wheel), ''nona'' (from dona = young woman), ''sekolah'' (from escola = school), ''lentera'' (from lanterna = lantern), ''paderi'' (from padre = priest), ''Santo, Santa'' (from Santo, Santa = Saint), ''puisi'' (from poesia = poetry), ''keju'' (from queijo = cheese), ''mentega'' (from manteiga = butter), ''serdadu'' (from soldado = soldier), ''meski'' (from mas que = although), ''kamar'' (from c\u00e2mara = room), ''laguna'' (from laguna = lagoon), ''lelang'' (from leil\u00e3o = auction), ''persero'' (from parceiro = company), ''markisa'' (from maracuj\u00e1 = passion fruit), ''limau'' (from lim\u00e3o = lemon), ''kartu'' (from cart\u00e3o = card), ''Inggris'' (from ingl\u00eas = English), ''Sabtu'' (from s\u00e1bado = Saturday), ''Minggu'' (from domingo = Sunday), etc.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp24\">{{Cite book | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300 |edition=2nd | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | pages =26  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-333-57689-2 }}</ref>\n\n=== Loan words of Dutch origin ===\n{{see also|List of Dutch loanwords in Indonesian}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Glodok wijk te Djakarta TMnr 10014951.jpg|thumb|alt=Crowd at a busy street intersection.

These [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanwords, and many other non-Italo-Iberian, European language loanwords that came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the [[schwa]]. For example, Dutch ''schroef'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sxruf]}} > ''sekrup'' {{IPA|[s\u0259\u02c8krup]}} (screw (n.)). One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words are inspired by the [[Dutch language]].<ref name=\"mai\">{{Cite journal|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/|title=A Hidden Language \u2013 Dutch in Indonesia|author=Hendrik M.

As a result, Malay words are written with that orthography such as: {{lang|ms|passer}} for the word {{lang|id|Pasar}} or {{lang|ms|djalan}} for the word {{lang|id|jalan}}, older Indonesian generation tend to have their name written in such order as well.\n\n=== Loan words of English origin ===\nMany English words were incorporated into Indonesian through [[globalisation]]. Many Indonesians, however, mistake words already adopted from Dutch as words borrowed from English. This is due to the Germanic traces that exist in the two languages. Indonesian adopts English words with standardisation. For example: {{lang|id|ima'''j'''ina'''si'''}} from {{lang|en|ima'''g'''ina'''tion'''}}, {{lang|id|universi'''tas'''}} from {{lang|en|universi'''ty'''}}, {{lang|id|a'''ks'''esor'''i'''}} from {{lang|en|a'''cc'''essor'''y'''}}, {{lang|id|geogra'''fi'''}} from {{lang|en|geogra'''phy'''}}, {{lang|id|'''k'''onserva'''tif'''}} from {{lang|en|'''c'''onserva'''tive'''}}, {{lang|id|r'''u'''ti'''n'''}} from {{lang|en|r'''ou'''ti'''ne'''}}, and so other.<ref name=\"lib.ui.ac.id\">{{Cite web |url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital%2F20316254-S42391-Kata%20serapan.pdf |title=Kata Serapan dan Kata Non-Serapan dalam Orang Asing dan Sang Pemberontak: Sebuah Kajian Semantis |trans-title=The Loanword and Non-Loanword in Orang Asing and Sang Pemberontak: A Semantic Study |publisher=University of Indonesia |date=2011 |author=Katarina Mellyna |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011113426/http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital%2F20316254-S42391-Kata%20serapan.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, there are several words that directly borrowed without standardisation that have same meanings in English such as: ''bus'', ''data'', ''domain'', ''detail'', ''internet'', ''film'', ''golf'', ''lift'', ''monitor'', ''radio'', ''radar'', ''unit'', ''safari'', ''sonar'', and ''video'', ''riil as real''.<ref name=\"lib.ui.ac.id\"/>\n\n=== Other loan words ===\nModern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources, there are many [[synonym]]s. For example, Indonesian has three words for \"book\", i.e. {{lang|id|pustaka}} (from Sanskrit), {{lang|id|kitab}} (from Arabic) and {{lang|id|buku}} (from Dutch {{lang|nl|boek}}); however, each has a slightly different meaning. A {{lang|id|pustaka}} is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, {{lang|id|perpustakaan}} means a library. A {{lang|id|kitab}} is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidance. The Indonesian words for the [[Bible]] and [[Gospel]] are {{lang|id|Alkitab}} and {{lang|id|Injil}}, both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the {{lang|id|kitab}}. {{lang|id|Buku}} is the most common word for books.\n\nThere are direct borrowings from various other languages of the world, such as ''karaoke'' (from {{lang|ja|\u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1}}) from [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and ''ebi'' (from {{lang|ja|\u3048\u3073}}) which means dried shrimp. Many words that originally are adopted through the Dutch language today however often are mistaken as English due to the similarity in the Germanic nature of both languages. In some cases the words are replaced by English language through globalisation: although the word {{lang|id|arbei}} (Dutch: {{lang|nl|aardbei}}) still literally means strawberry in Indonesian, today the usage of the word {{lang|id|stroberi}} is more common. [[Greek language|Greek]] words such as ''demokrasi'' (from \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 ''d\u0113mokrat\u00eda''), ''filosofi'' (from \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 ''philasophia''), ''mitos'' (from \u03bc\u1fe6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ''mythos'') came through Dutch, Arabic and Portuguese respectively.\n\nIt is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilises words that reflect the [[English language|English]] usage (as used by its former colonial power, the [[United Kingdom|British]]), while Indonesian uses a [[Latin]]ate form reflected in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] usage (e.g. ''aktiviti'' (Malaysian) vs. ''aktivitas'' (Indonesian), ''universiti'' (Malaysian) vs. ''universitas'' (Indonesian)).\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Indonesian literature}}\n\nIndonesia hosts a variety of traditional verbal arts such as [[poetry]], [[Narrative history|historical narratives]], [[romance film|romances]], and [[drama]]; which are expressed in local languages, but modern genres are expressed mainly through Indonesian.<ref name=\"hawaii.edu\"/> Some of classic Indonesian stories include [[Sitti Nurbaya]] by [[Marah Rusli]], [[Azab dan Sengsara]] by [[Merari Siregar]], and [[Sengsara Membawa Nikmat]] by [[Tulis Sutan Sati]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resourcefulindonesian.com/indonesian-literature.html|title=Indonesian Literature|website=Resourceful Indonesian|access-date=13 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618175250/https://www.resourcefulindonesian.com/indonesian-literature.html|archive-date=18 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/09/pdf32-1/32-1p.03-4.pdf |title=Recent Writers in Indonesia  |last=Sumardjo |first=Jakob |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011113425/http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/09/pdf32-1/32-1p.03-4.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2017 |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref> Modern literature like [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], stage plays, and [[Free verse|free-form poetry]] has developed since the late years of the 19th century and has produced such internationally recognised figures as [[novelist]] [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]], [[dramatist]] [[Willibrordus S.

It is an ancient [[asana]] in [[yoga]], predating [[hatha yoga]], and is widely used for [[meditation]] in [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Tantra]], [[Jainism|Jain]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions.\n\nVariations include half lotus, bound lotus, and psychic union pose. Advanced variations of several other asanas including yoga headstand have the legs in lotus or half lotus. The pose can be uncomfortable for people unused to sitting on the floor, and attempts to force the legs into position can injure the knees. \n\n[[Shiva]], the meditating ascetic God of [[Hinduism]], [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], and the [[Tirthankara]]s in [[Jainism]] have been depicted in the lotus position, especially in statues. The pose is used as an image of both Buddhist meditation and of yoga, and as such has found a place in Western culture as a symbol of healthy living and well-being.\n\n== Etymology and history==\n[[File:Sacred lotus Nelumbo nucifera.jpg|thumb|The flower of the sacred lotus, ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', grows out of mud, thus symbolising [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]].<!--{{sfn|Temple|2007|loc=Chapter 1, The Symbolism of the Lotus Flower}}--><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baillie |first1=Allan |last2=Ostro |first2=Suzanne |title=The Lotus |journal=Tricycle, The Buddhist Review |date=1999 |volume=8 |issue=3, Spring 1999 |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/the-lotus/ |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>]]\n\nThe name Padmasana is from the [[Sanskrit]] \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e ''Padma'', \"lotus\" and \u0906\u0938\u0928, \u0100sana, \"posture\" or \"seat\".{{sfn|Iyengar|1991|pages=129-133}}<ref>{{cite book |author=Zimmer, Heinrich Robert |authorlink=Heinrich Zimmer |title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IYVBgAAQBAJ |year=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-6684-7 |pages=100, 220 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906092006/https://books.google.com/books?id=5IYVBgAAQBAJ |archive-date=6 September 2017 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Nelumbo nucifera|sacred lotus]] is sometimes used as a symbol of growth towards perfection and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] as it is rooted in the mud at the bottom of the pond, but rises and blooms above the water.{{sfn|Temple|2007|p=Chapter 1, The Symbolism of the Lotus Flower}} In [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the pose is also called the \"[[vajra]] position\" (Skt.

He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices.

The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating [[magnetic field]].

Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=167\u2013173}}\n\n===The Nikola Tesla Company===\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=205\u2013206}} It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out.

It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I am in too much grief to talk.

He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.

The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating [[magnetic field]].

Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=167\u2013173}}\n\n===The Nikola Tesla Company===\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=205\u2013206}} It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out.

It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I am in too much grief to talk.

The cathedral, dedicated to the [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary]],  is the seat of the [[bishop of Padua]]. The church building, first erected as seat of a bishop of the diocese in the 4th century, has undergone major reconstructions over the centuries.\n\n==History==\nThe present church is the third structure built on the same site. The first cathedra was erected after the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and destroyed by an earthquake on 3 January 1117. It was rebuilt in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style: the appearance of that medieval church can be seen in the frescoes by [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]] in the adjoining [[baptistery]]. The current building dates from a reconstruction during the sixteenth century. While in the past the design was attributed to [[Michelangelo]], it was performed rather by [[Andrea della Valle]] and [[Agostino Righetto]], and has much in common with earlier Paduan churches. Construction began on the new [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] building in 1551 and went on for two centuries, being completed in 1754, yet leaving the fa\u00e7ade unfinished.\n\nThe Cathedral Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, and has the dignity of [[minor basilica]].<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/churches/italy/0091.htm Basilica Cattedrale di S. Maria, Cathedral-Basilica of St. Mary, Padova, Padova, Veneto, Italy</ref> It is also a parish center and allows for veneration of the bodies of San Daniele, San Leonino and San Gregorio Barbarigo.<ref name=wiki-it>[[:it:Duomo di Padova]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Paleochristian Age===\nTradition says that the first cathedral, dedicated to [[Santa Giustina]], was built after the [[Edict of Constantine]]. A pillar of stone surmounted by a cross marks its location in the current churchyard. During a restoration (ca 462 or 602) the [[Episcopal see]] of Patavium was joined to that of Santa Maria. Bishop Tricidio restored the cathedral in 620 and it was again rebuilt between 899-900 due to a fire. In 1075 the Bishop Olderico consecrated the new cathedral on the ruins of the previous church. For this last step construction, later historians suppose that the facade was located to the east, with a confession and a crypt under the apse where bishop Tricidio is buried.  His tombstone was discovered during the excavation of the foundations. This basilica collapsed during the January 3, 1117 earthquake.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\nExcavation and research by the Chair of Medieval Archeology at the University of Padua between 2011 and 2012 has expanded knowledge of the entire area around the Episcopal Palace, the Cathedral, and the Baptistery. In the north-east corner of the churchyard, they found the base of a tower with a square plan ({{convert|10|by|10|m|ft}} in the Romanesque style from between the 10th and 12th century.  The excavations found the foundations of buildings from between the Ninth and Eleventh century.  North of the Baptistery are a series of mosaic pavement from the Fourth and the Fifth Centuries.  Among the finds, a sarcophagus in stone for relics, a Lacerta altar dating from the Fifth or Sixth century, fragments of liturgical furnishings from various eras, graves (56 individuals) and traces of home workshops from the [[Longobard]] age.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n===The Cathedral of Macillo===\n[[File:Padova duomo presbiterio.jpg|thumb|Presbytery of Padua Cathedral]]As a result of the earthquake of 1117, a new cathedral was erected by architect Macillo, it is not clear whether on the ruins of the cathedral of Olderico or to a new location; opening a piazza and churchyard. It was consecrated the April 24, 1180.<ref name=wiki-it/> The new church stood in area of the current cathedral, with the identical orientation (facade to the east and presbytery to the west) divided into three naves and the transept. The side aisle to the south, overlooking a road that skirted the Episcopal Palace and the bell tower, the side aisle to the north was contiguous to the cloister of the canons and the Baptistery. Inside the nave and the aisles were divided by columns and pillars, alternative in the [[Ottonian]] tradition. In 1227 the campanile was rebuilt.  Bishop Stephen from Carrara promoted some restoration and embellishment of the vaults and (1399 and 1400).<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n===The new Cathedral===\nThe Bishop Peter Barozzi wanted to modernize the church with the construction of a new great presbytery second way et structure romanae ecclesiae Saint Peter, the project by [[Bernardo Rossellino]] for the choir of St. Peter's Basilica. The first stone of start the work was blessed and placed in the foundation the May 6, 1522 by Cardinal Francis Pisani who with the Canons and the prebendati funded the reconstruction. The project continued over two centuries. The January 2, 1551 the chapter of canons approved the model for the presbytery by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] to replace that of [[Jacopo Sansovino]]. The design of Michelangelo was completed within the next few decades. The presbytery was inaugurated by Bishop Federico Cornaro the April 14, 1582. Cornaro had to remove the old medieval bell tower initiated by Cardinal Pisani. The old facade was extended and adorned.  Toward 1635 the construction of the right arm of the transept was begun and in 1693 the left side.  The remains of the old cathedral were gradually removed and the new nave, designed by [[Gerolamo Frigimelica]] and [[Francesco Maria Preti]], as well as Giambattista Novello built on the same site. The Casthedral was consecrated on August 25, 1754 by [[Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico]]. It was then designated a [[minor basilica]]. Construction of the dome began in 1756 under the direction of John Glory and Giorgio Massari.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n==Exterior==\n[[File:Abside Cattedrale Padova.jpg|thumb|Apse, dome and bell tower of the Cathedral of Padua.]] The Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta stands between the Episcopal palace and the Baptistery. It is a [[Latin cross]] with three bays and an octagonal dome. The dome of the Glory covered in lead. Two [[sacristies]] adjoin the presbytery, one for the Canons and the other for the Prebendati. Between the Prebendati sacristy and the transept is the bell tower. The side doors open a small courtyard for the presbytery and on the Via Duomo, by the carriage entrance to the Episcopal palace. On the bell tower is a plaque from the Roman era that mentions the Gens Fabia of Veio, a title in the history of Padua from 49 B.C.<ref name=wiki-it/>\nThe unfinished facade\nThe facade onto which open the three portals and incomplete. According to the plans of Gerolamo Frigimelica and Preti would have had to open an airy atrium of access and on the upper floor, a solemn loggia, in the style of the Roman basilicas; in facade a great classic pediment supported by six mighty semi columns of the Corinthian order. Second architect to connect atrium, the loggia and the episcopal palace, would open a ramp covered, on the right, which was left unfinished. During the [[First World War]] a bomb hit the upper part of the facade. A small rose opening was created during the restoration.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n==Interior==\n[[File:Duomo (Padua) - View of the nave.jpg|thumb|General View of the inside of the Cathedral of Padua]]The [[nave]] is flanked by an [[aisle]] on each side.

The cathedral, dedicated to the [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary]],  is the seat of the [[bishop of Padua]]. The church building, first erected as seat of a bishop of the diocese in the 4th century, has undergone major reconstructions over the centuries.\n\n==History==\nThe present church is the third structure built on the same site. The first cathedra was erected after the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and destroyed by an earthquake on 3 January 1117. It was rebuilt in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style: the appearance of that medieval church can be seen in the frescoes by [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]] in the adjoining [[baptistery]]. The current building dates from a reconstruction during the sixteenth century, while in the past the design was attributed to [[Michelangelo]], the design was performed by [[Andrea della Valle]] and [[Agostino Righetto]], and has much in common with earlier Paduan churches. Construction began on the new [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] building in 1551, but lasted for centuries, completed in 1754, yet leaving the fa\u00e7ade unfinished.\n\nThe Cathedral Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, has the dignity of [[minor basilica]].<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/churches/italy/0091.htm Basilica Cattedrale di S. Maria, Cathedral-Basilica of St. Mary, Padova, Padova, Veneto, Italy</ref> It is also a parish center and allows for veneration of the bodies of San Daniele, San Leonino and San Gregorio Barbarigo.<ref name=wiki-it>[[:it:Duomo di Padova]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Paleochristian Age===\nTradition says that the first cathedral, dedicated to [[Santa Giustina]], was built after the [[Edict of Constantine]]. A pillar of stone surmounted by a cross marks its location in the current churchyard. During a restoration (ca 462 or 602) the [[Episcopal see]] of Patavium was joined to that of Santa Maria. Bishop Tricidio restored the cathedral in 620 and it was again rebuilt between 899-900 due to a fire. In 1075 the Bishop Olderico consecrated the new cathedral on the ruins of the previous church. For this last step construction, later historians suppose that the facade was located to the east, with a confession and a crypt under the apse where bishop Tricidio is buried.  His tombstone was discovered during the excavation of the foundations. This basilica collapsed during the January 3, 1117 earthquake.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\nExcavation and research by the Chair of Medieval Archeology at the University of Padua between 2011 and 2012 has expanded knowledge of the entire area around the Episcopal Palace, the Cathedral, and the Baptistery. In the north-east corner of the churchyard, they found the base of a tower with a square plan ({{convert|10|by|10|m|ft}} in the Romanesque style from between the 10th and 12th century.  The excavations found the foundations of buildings from between the Ninth and Eleventh century.  North of the Baptistery are a series of mosaic pavement from the Fourth and the Fifth Centuries.  Among the finds, a sarcophagus in stone for relics, a Lacerta altar dating from the Fifth or Sixth century, fragments of liturgical furnishings from various eras, graves (56 individuals) and traces of home workshops from the [[Longobard]] age.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n===The Cathedral of Macillo===\n[[File:Padova duomo presbiterio.jpg|thumb|Presbytery of Padua Cathedral]]As a result of the earthquake of 1117, a new cathedral was erected by architect Macillo, it is not clear whether on the ruins of the cathedral of Olderico or to a new location; opening a piazza and churchyard. It was consecrated the April 24, 1180.<ref name=wiki-it/> The new church stood in area of the current cathedral, with the identical orientation (facade to the east and presbytery to the west) divided into three naves and the transept. The side aisle to the south, overlooking a road that skirted the Episcopal Palace and the bell tower, the side aisle to the north was contiguous to the cloister of the canons and the Baptistery. Inside the nave and the aisles were divided by columns and pillars, alternative in the [[Ottonian]] tradition. In 1227 the campanile was rebuilt.  Bishop Stephen from Carrara promoted some restoration and embellishment of the vaults and (1399 and 1400).<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n===The new Cathedral===\nThe Bishop Peter Barozzi wanted to modernize the church with the construction of a new great presbytery second way et structure romanae ecclesiae Saint Peter, the project by [[Bernardo Rossellino]] for the choir of St. Peter's Basilica. The first stone of start the work was blessed and placed in the foundation the May 6, 1522 by Cardinal Francis Pisani who with the Canons and the prebendati funded the reconstruction. The project continued over two centuries. The January 2, 1551 the chapter of canons approved the model for the presbytery by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] to replace that of [[Jacopo Sansovino]]. The design of Michelangelo was completed within the next few decades. The presbytery was inaugurated by Bishop Federico Cornaro the April 14, 1582. Cornaro had to remove the old medieval bell tower initiated by Cardinal Pisani. The old facade was extended and adorned.  Toward 1635 the construction of the right arm of the transept was begun and in 1693 the left side.  The remains of the old cathedral were gradually removed and the new nave, designed by [[Gerolamo Frigimelica]] and [[Francesco Maria Preti]], as well as Giambattista Novello built on the same site. The Casthedral was consecrated on August 25, 1754 by [[Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico]]. It was then designated a [[minor basilica]]. Construction of the dome began in 1756 under the direction of John Glory and Giorgio Massari.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n==Exterior==\n[[File:Abside Cattedrale Padova.jpg|thumb|Apse, dome and bell tower of the Cathedral of Padua.]] The Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta stands between the Episcopal palace and the Baptistery.

Between the Prebendati sacristy and the transept is the bell tower. The side doors open a small courtyard for the presbytery and on the Via Duomo, by the carriage entrance to the Episcopal palace. On the bell tower is a plaque from the Roman era that mentions the Gens Fabia of Veio, a title in the history of Padua from 49 B.C.<ref name=wiki-it/>\nThe unfinished facade\nThe facade onto which open the three portals and incomplete. According to the plans of Gerolamo Frigimelica and Preti would have had to open an airy atrium of access and on the upper floor, a solemn loggia, in the style of the Roman basilicas; in facade a great classic pediment supported by six mighty semi columns of the Corinthian order. Second architect to connect atrium, the loggia and the episcopal palace, would open a ramp covered, on the right, which was left unfinished.

[[Muhammad Shah]], known as 'Rangila' (the Colourful) for his interest in art, took over the Red Fort in 1719. In 1739, Persian emperor [[Nadir Shah]] easily defeated the Mughal army, plundering the Red Fort, including the [[Peacock Throne]]. Nadir Shah returned to Persia after three months, leaving a destroyed city and a weakened Mughal empire to Muhammad Shah.<ref name=\"ASI3\" />{{rp|09}} The internal weakness of the Mughal Empire made the Mughals titular heads of Delhi, and a 1752 treaty made the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] protectors of the throne at Delhi.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=J.

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|title=Second-Generation Su-27s & Derivatives|author=Greg Goebel/chapter 2 of 2/ public domain|accessdate=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140354/http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport less than 1 metre off the ground.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at [[Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport]] extremely close to the ground piloted by [[Anatoly Kvochur]] ]]\n\nThe Su-30 is a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter.]] It has a two-seat cockpit with an [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrake]] behind the canopy.\n\n===Flight characteristics===\nThe integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the [[thrust vectoring]] control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital [[fly-by-wire]] system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and the [[tailslide]]. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[Radar lock-on|radar-lock]], as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |title=Discovering Novel Fighter Combat Maneuvers. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Powerplant===\nThe aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn [[AL-31]]F [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[low-bypass turbofan]] engines, fed through [[intake ramp]]s.

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes.

Created by prominent game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller brother of Nintendo's mascot [[Mario]], and appears in many games throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], often as a [[sidekick]] to his older brother.\n\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Mario Bros.|Mario Bros.]]'' as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the ''[[Mario Party]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game ''[[Nelsonic Industries|Luigi's Hammer Toss]]'', in ''[[Mario is Missing]]'', in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for the [[GameCube]] in 2001, in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013, in ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for the [[Wii U]] in 2013, in [[Luigi's Mansion Arcade|''Luigi's Mansion Arcade'']] in 2015 for arcades and [[Luigi's Mansion 3|''Luigi's Mansion 3'']] for [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three [[DiC]] TV series based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games.\n\nOriginally developed as a [[palette swap]] of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the ''Mario'' series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \"The Year of Luigi\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'', and the level pack ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for ''[[New Super Mario Bros U]]''. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' titled ''Luigi Bros.'' was also included with ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Luigi emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Luigi's hat and as a symbol for him in many game interfaces.]]\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \"[[Mario#Conception and creation|Jumpman]]\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.<ref name=\"hiscore\">Demaria, R: \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games\", page 238. McGraw Hill-Osbourne, 2002</ref> Miyamoto had been inspired by the game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\"/> Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]], called \"Mario & Luigi's\".<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\">{{cite web|publisher=International Arcade Museum|title=Mario Bros.

The later Japan-only version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in 1986 (later released in the west as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'') marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.<ref name=\"LL1up\">Hayward, Andrew.

In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]'' and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' depicts Luigi with this new look, but the actual games did not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]''-inspired version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\n\n===Actor portrayal===\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]], whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, [[falsetto]] voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of ''[[Mario Party]]'' feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from ''Mario Kart 64''. Luigi retained this higher voice in ''[[Mario Party 2]]''. In ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Party 3]]'', his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese ''Mario Kart 64''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', with raised pitches. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and subsequent instalments in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!-- Note that any content in this section, as with everywhere on Wikipedia, must be RELIABLY SOURCED.

Luigi always seems nervous and timid but is good-natured and not as quick to anger as his more famous brother. A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', who is held captive by Kamek. He also appeared in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], just like his adult self. Being the younger twin of Mario, Luigi is presumed to be also 24\u201325 years old.<ref>Mendelsohn, Tom (September 30, 2016).

''Super Mario Bros. 2'' introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', and ''Super Mario World'' returned to featuring Luigi as a reskinned Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''. Luigi was conspicuously absent in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. However, the [[Super Mario 64 DS|Nintendo DS remake]] of ''Super Mario 64'' features him as a playable character alongside Mario, [[Yoshi]], and [[Wario]]. He received his own starring role in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from [[King Boo]]. ''Luigi's Mansion'' has cultivated such a cult following that [[Nintendo]] made a sequel to the game nearly a decade after the original game's release date. The sequel is called ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' and is playable on the [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Nintendo World Report |title=Luigi's Mansion 2 to Haunt Nintendo 3DS |date = June 7, 2011 |author=Brown, Andrew |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/26596}}</ref> He reprised his role in the third game, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', on [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\nLuigi has been associated with the more difficult second acts of multiple ''Super Mario'' games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/new-super-luigi-u-review|title=New Super Luigi U Review|author=Jeremy Parish|work=[[USGamer]]|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> These include ''The Lost Levels'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' and the [[new game plus]] in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', which offer more challenging elaborations on their respective predecessors and allow the player to use Luigi as the main character, in whom reduced friction and higher jumping is consistent in all of these games.

He also appears in ''Super Mario 3D Land'' as a playable character as well as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called ''New Super Luigi U''. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\n\nLuigi appears in many of the ''Mario'' spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', and all of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]]. He also appears in all five instalments of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series; in the first three instalments, he is an unlockable character.\n\nLuigi has appeared in every [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing game]]. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he appears more prominently in the ''Paper Mario'' series. He is a non-playable character in the original ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In the sequel ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \"Mr. L.\" The ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all five ''Mario & Luigi'' games.\n\n===Other media===\n{{see also|Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros. (TV series)}}\n\nLuigi made his animated debut in the 1986 film ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach!]]''. In the film, he was voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]] and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach, although he was not as brave as Mario.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'' released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of [[Snow White]]. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]].\n\nLuigi regularly appeared in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast [[Danny Wells]] as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to [[Tony Rosato]]. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three [[DiC]] Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\"Life's Ruff\" from ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').\n\nLuigi played a different role in the [[Super Mario Bros.

Created by prominent game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller brother of Nintendo's mascot [[Mario]], and appears in many games throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], often as a [[sidekick]] to his older brother.\n\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Mario Bros.|Mario Bros.]]'' as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the ''[[Mario Party]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game ''[[Nelsonic Industries|Luigi's Hammer Toss]]'', in ''[[Mario is Missing]]'', in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for the [[GameCube]] in 2001, in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013, in ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for the [[Wii U]] in 2013, in [[Luigi's Mansion Arcade|''Luigi's Mansion Arcade'']] in 2015 for arcades and [[Luigi's Mansion 3|''Luigi's Mansion 3'']] for [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three [[DiC]] TV series based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games.\n\nOriginally developed as a [[palette swap]] of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the ''Mario'' series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \"The Year of Luigi\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'', and the level pack ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for ''[[New Super Mario Bros U]]''. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' titled ''Luigi Bros.'' was also included with ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Luigi emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Luigi's hat and as a symbol for him in many game interfaces.]]\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \"[[Mario#Conception and creation|Jumpman]]\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.<ref name=\"hiscore\">Demaria, R: \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games\", page 238. McGraw Hill-Osbourne, 2002</ref> Miyamoto had been inspired by the game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\"/> Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]], called \"Mario & Luigi's\".<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\">{{cite web|publisher=International Arcade Museum|title=Mario Bros.

The later Japan-only version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in 1986 (later released in the west as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'') marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.<ref name=\"LL1up\">Hayward, Andrew.

[[1up.com]]. Retrieved 2008-04-14.</ref>\n\nWhile this version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' was released in Japan, it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> In 1988, consequently, an alternative release was developed to serve as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for western players (and later released in Japan as ''Super Mario USA''); this version played a key role in shaping Luigi's current appearance.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> The game was a conversion of ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]'', with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the ''Mario'' franchise. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]'' and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' depicts Luigi with this new look, but the actual games did not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]''-inspired version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\n\n===Actor portrayal===\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]], whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, [[falsetto]] voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of ''[[Mario Party]]'' feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from ''Mario Kart 64''. Luigi retained this higher voice in ''[[Mario Party 2]]''. In ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Party 3]]'', his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese ''Mario Kart 64''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', with raised pitches. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and subsequent instalments in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!-- Note that any content in this section, as with everywhere on Wikipedia, must be RELIABLY SOURCED.

Luigi always seems nervous and timid but is good-natured and not as quick to anger as his more famous brother. A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', who is held captive by Kamek. He also appeared in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], just like his adult self. Being the younger twin of Mario, Luigi is presumed to be also 24\u201325 years old.<ref>Mendelsohn, Tom (September 30, 2016).

''Super Mario Bros. 2'' introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', and ''Super Mario World'' returned to featuring Luigi as a reskinned Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''. Luigi was conspicuously absent in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. However, the [[Super Mario 64 DS|Nintendo DS remake]] of ''Super Mario 64'' features him as a playable character alongside Mario, [[Yoshi]], and [[Wario]]. He received his own starring role in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from [[King Boo]]. ''Luigi's Mansion'' has cultivated such a cult following that [[Nintendo]] made a sequel to the game nearly a decade after the original game's release date.

He also appears in ''Super Mario 3D Land'' as a playable character as well as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called ''New Super Luigi U''. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\n\nLuigi appears in many of the ''Mario'' spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', and all of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]]. He also appears in all five instalments of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series; in the first three instalments, he is an unlockable character.\n\nLuigi has appeared in every [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing game]]. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he appears more prominently in the ''Paper Mario'' series. He is a non-playable character in the original ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In the sequel ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \"Mr. L.\" The ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all five ''Mario & Luigi'' games.\n\n===Other media===\n{{see also|Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros. (TV series)}}\n\nLuigi made his animated debut in the 1986 film ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach!]]''. In the film, he was voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]] and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach, although he was not as brave as Mario.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'' released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of [[Snow White]]. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]].\n\nLuigi regularly appeared in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast [[Danny Wells]] as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to [[Tony Rosato]]. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three [[DiC]] Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\"Life's Ruff\" from ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').\n\nLuigi played a different role in the [[Super Mario Bros.

He also worked on an undergraduate major his senior year.\n\nIn [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997]], as a freshman, Colombo red-shirted so that he could adjust to college football. In [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]], as a red-shirt freshman, he played in six games, including the final two.
