Preferred terms vary primarily by region and age. As indigenous people and communities are diverse, there is no consensus on naming, aside from the fact that most people prefer to be referred to by their specific [[Tribe (Native American)|nation]].\n\nWhen discussing broad groups of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship, such as \"[[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]-speaking peoples\", \"[[Pueblo]]-dwelling peoples\", \"[[Plains Indians]]\" or \"[[Sioux|LDN]] peoples\" ([[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Assiniboine|Nakota]] peoples).\n\nMany English [[exonym]]s have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the [[Americas]] (also known as the [[New World]]), who were resident within their own countries when [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Some of these names were based on [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or other European language terminology used by earlier explorers and colonists; some resulted from the colonists' attempt to translate [[endonym]]s from the native language into their own; and some were pejorative terms arising out of prejudice and fear, during periods of conflict (such as the [[American Indian Wars]]) between the cultures involved.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about the ways they wish to be referred to, pressing for the elimination of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term \"Native American\", to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. The term has been met with only partial acceptance. Other naming conventions have been proposed and used, but none are accepted by all indigenous groups. Typically, each name has a particular audience and political or cultural connotation, and regional usage varies.\n\nIn Canada, while [[Status Indian]] remains a legal designation due to the [[Indian Act]], the term \"Indian\" is generally considered offensive when used by non-Natives. The term [[First Nations]] is preferred for peoples covered by the Indian Act, and Indigenous peoples preferred for Native peoples generally or when talking about [[Inuit]] and [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] who do not fall under the \"First Nations\" category.\n\n== Issues affecting the debate ==\n* Historical, traditional use of a term (example: \"Indian\" is a name which many [[American Indian elder|elders]] have known all their lives, and their families may continue to use the familiar term)\n* Rejection of a word perceived as [[wikt:quaint|quaint]] or [[pejorative]] (example: \"[[Eskimo#Nomenclature|Eskimo]]\")\n* Rejection of names used by outsiders and not chosen by the tribe itself, or indigenous people at large (example: \"[[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]]\" is a French phrase; \"Native American\" was coined by the US government)\n* Perception that a name is inherently racist, or has over time acquired racist overtones (example: \"Redskin\")\n* Rejection of names assigned by an occupying and oppressive colonial government or expedition\n* Belief that a name is too inclusive or not inclusive enough of all indigenous people, so does not effectively represent the intended group. Examples: \"Aboriginal\", still used in Canada, has become associated with [[Aboriginal Australians]], given its wide use on that continent; the United Nations uses \"Indigenous\" to refer to all tribal peoples around the world (as their representatives chose to be identified); \"Native American\" in general use has not applied to indigenous peoples within Canada or Mexico\n* Reluctance to be referred to by a collective, racial name, rather than simply their traditional name for themselves\n* Belief that a universal or collective name suggests, inaccurately, that the indigenous cultures referred to are homogeneous, monolithic bodies, rather than the widely varied separate nations that they actually are\n* Understanding that \"Indians\" cannot be used to describe global indigenous cultures when it already is used for [[Indian people|people from India]]\n\n== United States ==\n{{see also|M\u00e9tis in the United States}}\n\n=== \"Indian\" and \"American Indian\" (since 1492) ===\n[[File:1683 Mortier Map of North America, the West Indies, and the Atlantic Ocean - Geographicus - Atlantique-mortier-1693.jpg|250px|right|thumb|1693 nautical chart of the Atlantic Ocean marked with \"''Route d'Europe aux Indes Occidentales''\" or \"West Indies\"]]\n\nEuropeans at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyage]] often referred to all of South and East Asia as \"India\" or \"the Indias/[[Indies]]\", sometimes dividing the area into \"[[Greater India]]\", \"Middle India\", and \"Lesser India\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Biggest Misnomer of All Time? |url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2015/ |date=2009-10-12 |last=Zimmer |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Zimmer |publisher=VisualThesaurus}}</ref> The [[Erdapfel|oldest surviving terrestrial globe]], by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492 (before Columbus' voyage), labels the entire Asian subcontinent region as \"India\".<ref name=Encarta>''Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia,'' 2003{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

Early historical accounts show that some colonists attempted to learn and record the [[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]] of these individual groups, but the use of the general term \"Indian\" persisted.\n\nIn 1968, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded. In 1977, a delegation from the [[International Indian Treaty Council]], an arm of AIM, elected to collectively identify as \"American Indian\", at the United Nations [[Conference on Indians in the Americas]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.

Additionally, \"American Indian\" is often understood to mean only the peoples of the mainland body of the United States, which excludes other [[Native Americans in the United States]] who are considered [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]; including the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]], [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] ([[Siberian Yupik people|Yuits]]/[[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]]/[[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Cup'ik]]), [[Inupiat people|I\u00f1upiat]], [[Aleut people|Aleut]] (i.e., the groups whose traditional languages are [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages]]), [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]], and [[Samoan people|Samoan]]; who are referred to collectively as either [[Alaskan Native]]s, [[First Nations]], [[Native Hawaiians]] or [[Siberian]]s.\n\nSupporters of the terms \"Indian\" and \"American Indian\" argue that they have been in use for such a long period of time that many people have become accustomed to them and no longer consider them [[exonym]]s. Both terms are still widely used today. \"American Indian\" appears often in treaties between the United States and the indigenous peoples with whom they have been negotiating since the colonial period, and many federal, state and local laws also use it.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Indian vs. Native American: A note on terminology |url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526 |accessdate=31 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Native American\" (since the 1960s) ===\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites usage of the uncapitalized term ''native American'' in several publications reaching as far back as 1737,<ref name=\"Oxford English Dictionary\">{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> but it is unclear whether these texts refer to indigenous peoples or simply to [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|persons born on American soil]].

I\u20135) Canadian [[Constitution Act, 1982]], [[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 25]] and [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|35]].</ref> The singular commonly used is \"First Nations person\" (when gender-specific, \"First Nations man\" or \"First Nations woman\").\n\nSome tribal governments of Canada also use the term \"First Nations\" to refer to any indigenous, tribal or nomadic society, using the term for such diverse groups as the [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Sami people|Saami]], [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], and the Australian Aborigines.<ref name=\"Rights\" />\n\nAlthough the Canadian government has formally adopted use of the term \"First Nations\" and \"Aboriginal peoples\", the federal ministerial portfolio in charge of their affairs is named the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and under the [[Federal Identity Program]] is referred to as [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] (AANDC), and the historical term \"[[Indian Reserve]]\" is still a legal land description. Some First Nations peoples also use \"Indian Band\" in their official names.\n\n==== \"First Peoples\" ====\n\"First Peoples\" is a broad term that includes First Nations, Inuit, [[Inuvialuit]], and M\u00e9tis (equivalent to \"Aboriginal\" or \"indigenous\" peoples)\u2014and could be extended outside the Canadian context to comprise all descendants of pre-Columbian ethnic groups in the Americas, including (self-identified) ethnic groups whose ancestry is only partially of pre-Columbian groups (e.g., [[Mestizo]]). Due to its similarity with the term \"First Nations\", the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\n=== \"Native Canadians\" ===\n\"Native\" or \"Native Canadian\" is an ambiguous term, but people frequently use it in conversation or informal writing. A great majority use this term for describing aboriginal peoples, including aboriginal people themselves.\n\n=== Canadian French nomenclature ===\nIn [[Canadian French]], the terms are ''premi\u00e8re(s) nation(s)'' for \"First Nations\" and ''autochtone'' for \"Aboriginal\" (used both as a noun and adjective).\n\nThe term ''indien'' or ''indienne'' is used in the legislation, although the preferred term is now ''am\u00e9rindien''. The term ''indig\u00e8ne'' is not used as it is seen as having negative connotations because of its similarity to the French equivalent of ''indigent'' (\"poor\"). It has also acquired further negative associations in French, due to the ''[[indig\u00e9nat]]'' code enforced in French colonial Africa, 1887\u20131947. The old French term ''{{Not a typo|sauvage}}'' (\"wild\") is no longer used either, as it is considered racist.\n\n=== \"Inuit\" (since 1977) ===\n{{See also|Inuit#Nomenclature}}\nAs a result of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference meeting in [[Barrow, Alaska]], in 1977, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with ''Inuit'' (''Inuk'' in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is ''Inuinnaq'',<ref name=translate>{{cite book |last=Ohokak |first=G. |last2=Kadlun |first2=M. |last3=Harnum |first3=B. |title=Inuinnaqtun-English Dictionary |publisher=Kitikmeot Heritage Society}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> and in the eastern Canadian Arctic ''[[Inuit]]''. The language is often called ''[[Inuktitut]]'', though other local designations are also used.\n\n=== Regional ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n==== \"Anishinaabe\" ====\nThe [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] [[Ethnonym|autonym]] ''[[Anishinaabe]]'', or ''Anishinabe'', is used as a cross-tribal term in Algonquian-majority areas, such as Anishnabe Health, Anishnabe Education, and Training Circle. The term is also used among historically Anishinaabe peoples in the [[Upper Midwest]] region of the United States.\n\n==== Chinook Jargon nomenclature ====\nThe [[Chinook Jargon]], the old trade language of the Pacific Northwest, uses ''siwash'' (an adaptation of the French ''{{Not a typo|sauvage}}'') for \"Indian\", \"Native American\", or \"First Nations\", either as adjective or noun. While normally meaning a male native, it is used in certain combinations, such as ''siwash cosho'' (\"a seal\", literally \"Indian pig\" or \"Indian pork\").\n\nMany native communities perceive the terms ''{{Not a typo|sauvage}}'' and ''siwash'' negatively, but others use it freely. They consider use by non-natives to be derogatory. In the creolized form of Chinook Jargon spoken at the [[Grand Ronde Community|Grand Ronde]] Agency in Oregon, a distinction is made between ''siwash'' and ''sawash''. The accent in the latter is on the second syllable, resembling the French original, and is used in Grand Ronde Jargon meaning \"anything native or Indian\"; by contrast, they consider ''siwash'' to be defamatory.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe Chinook Jargon term for a native woman is ''klootchman'', an originally [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nootka]] word adopted in regional English to mean a native woman or, as in the Jargon, all women and also anything female. It originated as a compound of Nootka ''\u0142\u016bts'' 'female' with the English suffix ''-man''. ''Hyas klootchman tyee'' means \"queen\", ''klootchman cosho'', \"sow\"; and ''klootchman tenas'' or ''tenas klootchman'' means \"girl\" or \"little girl\". Generally ''klootchman'' in regional English simply means a native woman and has not acquired the derisive sense of ''siwash'' or ''[[squaw]]''. The short form ''klootch''\u2014encountered only in English-Chinook hybrid phrasings\u2014is always derisive, especially in forms such as ''blue-eyed klootch''.\n\n== Latin America ==\nIn [[Mexico]], the preferred expression used by both the Government and the media is \"Indigenous peoples\" ({{lang|es|pueblos ind\u00edgenas}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).\n\nIn [[South America]], the preferred expression for the population is also Indigenous peoples ({{lang|es|pueblos ind\u00edgenas}} and {{lang|es|pueblos originarios}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and {{lang|pt|povos ind\u00edgenas}} in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). In Spanish Latin America, \"Indians\" ({{lang|es|indios}}) is increasingly no longer used \u2013 today, to refer to indigenous people from a rural area, one would most likely say {{lang|es|campesino originario}} or {{lang|es|ind\u00edgena campesino}}.\n\nIn Brazil the most usual expression is by far {{lang|pt|\u00edndio}}, with {{lang|pt|ind\u00edgena}} sounding a little more formal; the Portuguese demonym for the country of India is {{lang|pt|indiano}}. {{lang|es|Indios}} is still in common use, including among people of Indigenous identity. In Mexico, [[Brazil]], and several other countries, these names are normally applied only to the ethnic groups that have maintained their identity and, to a some extent, their original way of life.\n\nLess common terms for Indigenous peoples of the Americas include {{lang|es|amerindio}} (in Spanish) and {{lang|pt|amer\u00edndio}} (in Portuguese).\n\nIn most of Latin America there are also large segments of the population with mixed Indigenous and non-Indigenous ancestry, who are largely integrated into mainstream society, and by and large no longer identify themselves with their Indigenous ancestral groups unless they coexist with their ancestral Indigenous nation. Names for such groups include {{lang|es|mestizo}}, {{lang|es|zambo}} and {{lang|es|pardo}} in Spanish, for people with European/Middle Eastern, Native and European/Middle Eastern and African admixed ancestry, respectively, besides {{lang|es|castizo}} for people who are over three quarters European with some Native assimilation, and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (current) or {{lang|pt|mameluco}} (dated), {{lang|pt|cafuzo}}, {{lang|pt|ju\u00e7ara}}, {{lang|pt|[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ainoko ainoko]}}/{{lang|pt|ainoco}}and {{lang|pt|sarar\u00e1}} in Portuguese, for people of European and Native, Native and African, European/Middle Eastern, Native and African, East Asian (most particularly [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]]), and European and the latter being mostly European/Middle Eastern and African (with fair hair and skin, but black facial features and/or hair texture) admixed ancestry, respectively, with the first three necessarily involving a degree of Indigenous ancestry. {{lang|pt|Ainokos}} and {{lang|pt|sarar\u00e1s}} might have some level of Native DNA assimilation. {{lang|pt|Ainoko}} is sometimes replaced by another Japanese term known as {{lang|pt|hafu}} or {{lang|pt|eurasiano}}, involving all Asians.\n\nIn some Spanish-speaking countries, there are also [[Ladino people|Ladinos]] who do not have significant European ancestry, but have adopted the culture of the dominant non-Indigenous population. In Brazil, however, assimilated Indigenous people are called {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (itself a subset of [[pardo]]s, or brown people), the same term used for people of European and Amerindian mix who do not have at the same time a white-passing phenotype and a mainstream Brazilian cultural identity \u2013 which also means that {{lang|pt|caboclos}} are not necessarily {{lang|pt|[[mesti\u00e7o]]s}} (Portuguese for \"mixed-race\" in general).\n\n== International ==\n\n=== \"Indigenous peoples\" ===\nDuring the late 20th century the term \"Indigenous peoples\" evolved into a political term that refers to ethnic groups with historical ties to groups that existed in a territory prior to [[colonization]] or formation of a [[nation state]]. In the Americas, the term \"Indigenous peoples of the Americas\" was adopted, and the term is tailored to specific geographic or political regions, such as \"[[Indigenous peoples of Panama]]\". \"'Indigenous peoples' ... is a term that internationalizes the experiences, the issues and the struggles of some of the world's colonized peoples\", writes [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] educator [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith]]. \"The final 's' in 'indigenous peoples' ... [is] a way of recognizing that there are real differences between different indigenous peoples.\"<ref>Smith, p. 7</ref>\n\n===Turtle Islander===\nAnother, less commonly used term is in reference to the continent: [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. Though officially named [[North America]], a number of histories from various Turtle Island countries make reference to the continent existing atop a turtle's back. Though not present across all nations and countries, this symbolism and icon has spread to become nearly pan-Indigenous. As Europeans, Asians and Africans have terms that allude to their home continents, \"Turtle Islander\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=McLaren |first1=David |title=Encountering the Other |date=26 February 2007 |publisher=Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation Report to the Ipperwash Inquiry |location=Nawash Unceded First Nation |pages=1, 58 |url=https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/inquiries/ipperwash/policy_part/projects/pdf/Chippewas_of_Nawash-Encountering_the_Other.pdf |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> is an attempt to do just that.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dragland |first1=Stan |title=Floating Voice: Duncan Campbell Scott and the Literature of Treaty 9 |date=1994 |publisher=House of Anansi |isbn=9780887845512 |page=34 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=@plantweaver |title=\"All Nations Rise\" ~ the powerful heart of indigenous Turtle Islander, Din\u00e9 peacewalker Lyla June Johnston |url=https://steemit.com/lylajunejohnston/@planetweaver/all-nations-rise-the-powerful-heart-of-navajo-lyla-june-johnston |website=steemit |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Controversial terminology ==\n=== Indian/Injun ===\nIn some situations, the term \"[[Indian princess (Native American)|Indian princess]]\" is considered demeaning to Native American women as the concept of a \"princess\" is not a part of Native culture; dressing up with fake Native regalia as in a [[Halloween]] \"Indian Princess\" costume is considered particularly offensive.<ref>[http://thoughtcatalog.com/jill-marie-gavin/2013/08/native-america-what-youre-doing-wrong/ Gavin, Jill-Marie. \"Native America: What You\u2019re Doing Wrong\"]</ref> However, this should not be confused with the more recent practice of tribes, [[powwow]] organizations, colleges, and other indigenous groups choosing young women with leadership and talent to represent their groups as tribal \"princesses.\"<ref>[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/ok/es_ok_parade_1.html \"The American Indian Exposition in Anadarko, Oklahoma.\"] ''America's Story.''.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, representatives of the relatively new United States government often used the term in official records when referring to Indian nations (e.g., Justice Baldwin's concurring opinion in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Cherokee Nation v. Georgia |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=30&invol=1 |publisher=United States Supreme Court |year=1831}}</ref>). This was related to their association of non-Christian people as savages. Early anthropologist [[Lewis H.

Preferred terms vary primarily by region and age. As indigenous people and communities are diverse, there is no consensus on naming, aside from the fact that most people prefer to be referred to by their specific [[Tribe (Native American)|nation]].\n\nWhen discussing broad groups of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship, such as \"[[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]-speaking peoples\", \"[[Pueblo]]-dwelling peoples\", \"[[Plains Indians]]\" or \"[[Sioux|LDN]] peoples\" ([[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Assiniboine|Nakota]] peoples).\n\nMany English [[exonym]]s have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the [[Americas]] (also known as the [[New World]]), who were resident within their own countries when [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Some of these names were based on [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or other European language terminology used by earlier explorers and colonists; some resulted from the colonists' attempt to translate [[endonym]]s from the native language into their own; and some were pejorative terms arising out of prejudice and fear, during periods of conflict (such as the [[American Indian Wars]]) between the cultures involved.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about the ways they wish to be referred to, pressing for the elimination of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term \"Native American\", to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. The term has been met with only partial acceptance. Other naming conventions have been proposed and used, but none are accepted by all indigenous groups. Typically, each name has a particular audience and political or cultural connotation, and regional usage varies.\n\nIn Canada, while [[Status Indian]] remains a legal designation due to the [[Indian Act]], the term \"Indian\" is generally considered offensive when used by non-Natives. The term [[First Nations]] is preferred for peoples covered by the Indian Act, and Indigenous peoples preferred for Native peoples generally or when talking about [[Inuit]] and [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] who do not fall under the \"First Nations\" category.\n\n== Issues affecting the debate ==\n* Historical, traditional use of a term (example: \"Indian\" is a name which many [[American Indian elder|elders]] have known all their lives, and their families may continue to use the familiar term)\n* Rejection of a word perceived as [[wikt:quaint|quaint]] or [[pejorative]] (example: \"[[Eskimo#Nomenclature|Eskimo]]\")\n* Rejection of names used by outsiders and not chosen by the tribe itself, or indigenous people at large (example: \"[[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]]\" is a French phrase; \"Native American\" was coined by the US government)\n* Perception that a name is inherently racist, or has over time acquired racist overtones (example: \"Redskin\")\n* Rejection of names assigned by an occupying and oppressive colonial government or expedition\n* Belief that a name is too inclusive or not inclusive enough of all indigenous people, so does not effectively represent the intended group. Examples: \"Aboriginal\", still used in Canada, has become associated with [[Aboriginal Australians]], given its wide use on that continent; the United Nations uses \"Indigenous\" to refer to all tribal peoples around the world (as their representatives chose to be identified); \"Native American\" in general use has not applied to indigenous peoples within Canada or Mexico\n* Reluctance to be referred to by a collective, racial name, rather than simply their traditional name for themselves\n* Belief that a universal or collective name suggests, inaccurately, that the indigenous cultures referred to are homogeneous, monolithic bodies, rather than the widely varied separate nations that they actually are\n* Understanding that \"Indians\" cannot be used to describe global indigenous cultures when it already is used for [[Indian people|people from India]]\n\n== United States ==\n{{see also|M\u00e9tis in the United States}}\n\n=== \"Indian\" and \"American Indian\" (since 1492) ===\n[[File:1683 Mortier Map of North America, the West Indies, and the Atlantic Ocean - Geographicus - Atlantique-mortier-1693.jpg|250px|right|thumb|1693 nautical chart of the Atlantic Ocean marked with \"''Route d'Europe aux Indes Occidentales''\" or \"West Indies\"]]\n\nEuropeans at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyage]] often referred to all of South and East Asia as \"India\" or \"the Indias/[[Indies]]\", sometimes dividing the area into \"[[Greater India]]\", \"Middle India\", and \"Lesser India\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Biggest Misnomer of All Time? |url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/2015/ |date=2009-10-12 |last=Zimmer |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Zimmer |publisher=VisualThesaurus}}</ref> The [[Erdapfel|oldest surviving terrestrial globe]], by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492 (before Columbus' voyage), labels the entire Asian subcontinent region as \"India\".<ref name=Encarta>''Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia,'' 2003{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

This misnomer was perpetuated in place naming; the islands of the [[Caribbean]] were named, and are still known as, the [[West Indies]].\n\nAs European colonists began to move into the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries, and have more sustained contact with the resident peoples, it became clear to them that the residents were not a homogeneous group sharing a unified culture and government, but discrete societies with their own distinct languages and social systems. Early historical accounts show that some colonists attempted to learn and record the [[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]] of these individual groups, but the use of the general term \"Indian\" persisted.\n\nIn 1968, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded. In 1977, a delegation from the [[International Indian Treaty Council]], an arm of AIM, elected to collectively identify as \"American Indian\", at the United Nations [[Conference on Indians in the Americas]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. Some activists and public figures of indigenous descent, such as [[Russell Means]], prefer \"American Indian\" to the more recently adopted \"Native American\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://oser.state.wi.us/pgsub_detail.asp?linksubcat2id=639&linksubcatid=1023&linkcatid=352&linkid= |title=Indian Eristic |date=January 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=Wisconsin Office of State Employment Relations }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"McClinton-TempleVelie2010\">{{cite book|author1=Jennifer McClinton-Temple|author2=Alan Velie|title=Encyclopedia of American Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HeSvlkGFl4C&pg=PR12|date=12 May 2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2087-4|page=12}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative etymology====\nIn the late 20th century, some American public figures suggested that the origin of the term was not from a confusion with India, but from the Spanish expression ''En Dios'', meaning \"in God\", or a similar one in Italian.

Wilton also says that many European languages since Greek and Roman times used variations of the term \"Indian\" to describe the peoples of the Indian subcontinent, more than a millennium before the voyages of Columbus.<ref name=WORDMYTHS/>\n\n==== Objections (since the 1970s) ====\nObjections to the usage of \"Indian\" and \"American Indian\" include the fact that \"Indian\" arose from a historical error, and thus does not accurately reflect the derivation of the people to whom it refers; and some feel that the term has absorbed negative and demeaning connotations through its historical usage that render it objectionable in context. Additionally, \"American Indian\" is often understood to mean only the peoples of the mainland body of the United States, which excludes other [[Native Americans in the United States]] who are considered [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]; including the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]], [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] ([[Siberian Yupik people|Yuits]]/[[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]]/[[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Cup'ik]]), [[Inupiat people|I\u00f1upiat]], [[Aleut people|Aleut]] (i.e., the groups whose traditional languages are [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages]]), [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]], and [[Samoan people|Samoan]]; who are referred to collectively as either [[Alaskan Native]]s, [[First Nations]], [[Native Hawaiians]] or [[Siberian]]s.\n\nSupporters of the terms \"Indian\" and \"American Indian\" argue that they have been in use for such a long period of time that many people have become accustomed to them and no longer consider them [[exonym]]s. Both terms are still widely used today. \"American Indian\" appears often in treaties between the United States and the indigenous peoples with whom they have been negotiating since the colonial period, and many federal, state and local laws also use it.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Indian vs. Native American: A note on terminology |url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526 |accessdate=31 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Native American\" (since the 1960s) ===\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites usage of the uncapitalized term ''native American'' in several publications reaching as far back as 1737,<ref name=\"Oxford English Dictionary\">{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> but it is unclear whether these texts refer to indigenous peoples or simply to [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|persons born on American soil]].

The group later formed the \"[[Know-Nothings]]\", a 19th-century political party that [[Opposition to immigration#United States|opposed immigration to the United States]], a policy known as [[Nativism (politics)#United States|nativism]]. The Know-Nothings also called themselves the \"Native American Party\" and were referred to in the press with the capitalized term.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary}}{{Clarify|date=December 2013|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

This term was considered to represent historical fact more accurately (i.e., \"Native\" cultures predated European colonization), while activists also believed it was free of negative historical connotations that had come to be associated with previous terms.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1993, most American [[manual of style|manuals of style]] came to agree that \"color terms\" referring to ethnic groups should be capitalized as proper names, as well as ''Native American''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wachal |first=Robert S. |title=The Capitalization of Black and Native American |journal=American Speech |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=364\u201365 |date=Winter 2000 |doi=10.1215/00031283-75-4-364 |url=http://americanspeech.dukejournals.org/content/75/4/364.full.pdf+html}} {{subscription required}}</ref> \n\nOther objections to ''Native American''\u2014whether capitalized or not\u2014include a concern that it is often understood to exclude American groups outside the continental US (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico), and indigenous groups in South America, Mexico and Canada. The word ''American'' is sometimes questioned because the peoples referred to resided in the Americas before they were so named.\n\nAs of 1995, according to the [[US Census Bureau]], 50% of people who identified as Indigenous preferred the term ''American Indian'', 37% preferred ''Native American'', and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tucker |first=Clyde |last2=Kojetin |first2=Brian |last3=Harrison |first3=Roderick |title=A statistical analysis of the CPS supplement on race and ethnic origin |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of the Census |work=Census.gov |date=May 1995 |accessdate=2013-12-13 |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Indigenous\" (1980s) ===\nAccording to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary]]'', \"''indigenous'' specifies that something or someone is native rather than coming or being brought in from elsewhere: an indigenous crop; the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], a people indigenous to the northernmost islands of Japan.\"<ref>{{cite dictionary |dictionary=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=2004 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/native |accessdate=November 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe United Nations [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] used the term \"indigenous peoples\" for the first time in its official political declaration in 2002.

Until about 1910, these terms were used in English to refer to various indigenous peoples. Today throughout most of the English-speaking world, it is most commonly understood to refer to the [[Indigenous Australians]], with the notable exception of Canada, where the term \"aboriginal\" refers to [[Aboriginal Canadians]] (but usually \"aborigine\" does not) (see below).\n\n=== \"Alaska Native\" ===\n\"[[Alaska Native]]\" refers to the indigenous peoples in [[Alaska]], including the [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]], [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]], [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Cup'ik]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Inuit]], [[Inupiat people|I\u00f1upiat]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] and [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]] peoples.

Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. Retrieved 12 April 2012.</ref>\n\n\"First Nations\" (most often used in the plural) has come into general use for the [[Indigenous peoples]] of [[North America]] located in what is now Canada, and their descendants, excluding the [[Inuit]] and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], who have distinct identities.<ref name=\"Rights\">(R.S., 1985, c. I\u20135) Canadian [[Constitution Act, 1982]], [[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 25]] and [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|35]].</ref> The singular commonly used is \"First Nations person\" (when gender-specific, \"First Nations man\" or \"First Nations woman\").\n\nSome tribal governments of Canada also use the term \"First Nations\" to refer to any indigenous, tribal or nomadic society, using the term for such diverse groups as the [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Sami people|Saami]], [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], and the Australian Aborigines.<ref name=\"Rights\" />\n\nAlthough the Canadian government has formally adopted use of the term \"First Nations\" and \"Aboriginal peoples\", the federal ministerial portfolio in charge of their affairs is named the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and under the [[Federal Identity Program]] is referred to as [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] (AANDC), and the historical term \"[[Indian Reserve]]\" is still a legal land description. Some First Nations peoples also use \"Indian Band\" in their official names.\n\n==== \"First Peoples\" ====\n\"First Peoples\" is a broad term that includes First Nations, Inuit, [[Inuvialuit]], and M\u00e9tis (equivalent to \"Aboriginal\" or \"indigenous\" peoples)\u2014and could be extended outside the Canadian context to comprise all descendants of pre-Columbian ethnic groups in the Americas, including (self-identified) ethnic groups whose ancestry is only partially of pre-Columbian groups (e.g., [[Mestizo]]). Due to its similarity with the term \"First Nations\", the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\n=== \"Native Canadians\" ===\n\"Native\" or \"Native Canadian\" is an ambiguous term, but people frequently use it in conversation or informal writing. A great majority use this term for describing aboriginal peoples, including aboriginal people themselves.\n\n=== Canadian French nomenclature ===\nIn [[Canadian French]], the terms are ''premi\u00e8re(s) nation(s)'' for \"First Nations\" and ''autochtone'' for \"Aboriginal\" (used both as a noun and adjective).\n\nThe term ''indien'' or ''indienne'' is used in the legislation, although the preferred term is now ''am\u00e9rindien''. The term ''indig\u00e8ne'' is not used as it is seen as having negative connotations because of its similarity to the French equivalent of ''indigent'' (\"poor\"). It has also acquired further negative associations in French, due to the ''[[indig\u00e9nat]]'' code enforced in French colonial Africa, 1887\u20131947. The old French term ''{{Not a typo|sauvage}}'' (\"wild\") is no longer used either, as it is considered racist.\n\n=== \"Inuit\" (since 1977) ===\n{{See also|Inuit#Nomenclature}}\nAs a result of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference meeting in [[Barrow, Alaska]], in 1977, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with ''Inuit'' (''Inuk'' in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is ''Inuinnaq'',<ref name=translate>{{cite book |last=Ohokak |first=G. |last2=Kadlun |first2=M. |last3=Harnum |first3=B. |title=Inuinnaqtun-English Dictionary |publisher=Kitikmeot Heritage Society}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> and in the eastern Canadian Arctic ''[[Inuit]]''. The language is often called ''[[Inuktitut]]'', though other local designations are also used.\n\n=== Regional ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n==== \"Anishinaabe\" ====\nThe [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] [[Ethnonym|autonym]] ''[[Anishinaabe]]'', or ''Anishinabe'', is used as a cross-tribal term in Algonquian-majority areas, such as Anishnabe Health, Anishnabe Education, and Training Circle. The term is also used among historically Anishinaabe peoples in the [[Upper Midwest]] region of the United States.\n\n==== Chinook Jargon nomenclature ====\nThe [[Chinook Jargon]], the old trade language of the Pacific Northwest, uses ''siwash'' (an adaptation of the French ''{{Not a typo|sauvage}}'') for \"Indian\", \"Native American\", or \"First Nations\", either as adjective or noun. While normally meaning a male native, it is used in certain combinations, such as ''siwash cosho'' (\"a seal\", literally \"Indian pig\" or \"Indian pork\").\n\nMany native communities perceive the terms ''{{Not a typo|sauvage}}'' and ''siwash'' negatively, but others use it freely. They consider use by non-natives to be derogatory. In the creolized form of Chinook Jargon spoken at the [[Grand Ronde Community|Grand Ronde]] Agency in Oregon, a distinction is made between ''siwash'' and ''sawash''. The accent in the latter is on the second syllable, resembling the French original, and is used in Grand Ronde Jargon meaning \"anything native or Indian\"; by contrast, they consider ''siwash'' to be defamatory.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe Chinook Jargon term for a native woman is ''klootchman'', an originally [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nootka]] word adopted in regional English to mean a native woman or, as in the Jargon, all women and also anything female. It originated as a compound of Nootka ''\u0142\u016bts'' 'female' with the English suffix ''-man''. ''Hyas klootchman tyee'' means \"queen\", ''klootchman cosho'', \"sow\"; and ''klootchman tenas'' or ''tenas klootchman'' means \"girl\" or \"little girl\". Generally ''klootchman'' in regional English simply means a native woman and has not acquired the derisive sense of ''siwash'' or ''[[squaw]]''. The short form ''klootch''\u2014encountered only in English-Chinook hybrid phrasings\u2014is always derisive, especially in forms such as ''blue-eyed klootch''.\n\n== Latin America ==\nIn [[Mexico]], the preferred expression used by both the Government and the media is \"Indigenous peoples\" ({{lang|es|pueblos ind\u00edgenas}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).\n\nIn [[South America]], the preferred expression for the population is also Indigenous peoples ({{lang|es|pueblos ind\u00edgenas}} and {{lang|es|pueblos originarios}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and {{lang|pt|povos ind\u00edgenas}} in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). In Spanish Latin America, \"Indians\" ({{lang|es|indios}}) is increasingly no longer used \u2013 today, to refer to indigenous people from a rural area, one would most likely say {{lang|es|campesino originario}} or {{lang|es|ind\u00edgena campesino}}.\n\nIn Brazil the most usual expression is by far {{lang|pt|\u00edndio}}, with {{lang|pt|ind\u00edgena}} sounding a little more formal; the Portuguese demonym for the country of India is {{lang|pt|indiano}}. {{lang|es|Indios}} is still in common use, including among people of Indigenous identity. In Mexico, [[Brazil]], and several other countries, these names are normally applied only to the ethnic groups that have maintained their identity and, to a some extent, their original way of life.\n\nLess common terms for Indigenous peoples of the Americas include {{lang|es|amerindio}} (in Spanish) and {{lang|pt|amer\u00edndio}} (in Portuguese).\n\nIn most of Latin America there are also large segments of the population with mixed Indigenous and non-Indigenous ancestry, who are largely integrated into mainstream society, and by and large no longer identify themselves with their Indigenous ancestral groups unless they coexist with their ancestral Indigenous nation. Names for such groups include {{lang|es|mestizo}}, {{lang|es|zambo}} and {{lang|es|pardo}} in Spanish, for people with European/Middle Eastern, Native and European/Middle Eastern and African admixed ancestry, respectively, besides {{lang|es|castizo}} for people who are over three quarters European with some Native assimilation, and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (current) or {{lang|pt|mameluco}} (dated), {{lang|pt|cafuzo}}, {{lang|pt|ju\u00e7ara}}, {{lang|pt|[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ainoko ainoko]}}/{{lang|pt|ainoco}}and {{lang|pt|sarar\u00e1}} in Portuguese, for people of European and Native, Native and African, European/Middle Eastern, Native and African, East Asian (most particularly [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]]), and European and the latter being mostly European/Middle Eastern and African (with fair hair and skin, but black facial features and/or hair texture) admixed ancestry, respectively, with the first three necessarily involving a degree of Indigenous ancestry. {{lang|pt|Ainokos}} and {{lang|pt|sarar\u00e1s}} might have some level of Native DNA assimilation. {{lang|pt|Ainoko}} is sometimes replaced by another Japanese term known as {{lang|pt|hafu}} or {{lang|pt|eurasiano}}, involving all Asians.\n\nIn some Spanish-speaking countries, there are also [[Ladino people|Ladinos]] who do not have significant European ancestry, but have adopted the culture of the dominant non-Indigenous population. In Brazil, however, assimilated Indigenous people are called {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (itself a subset of [[pardo]]s, or brown people), the same term used for people of European and Amerindian mix who do not have at the same time a white-passing phenotype and a mainstream Brazilian cultural identity \u2013 which also means that {{lang|pt|caboclos}} are not necessarily {{lang|pt|[[mesti\u00e7o]]s}} (Portuguese for \"mixed-race\" in general).\n\n== International ==\n\n=== \"Indigenous peoples\" ===\nDuring the late 20th century the term \"Indigenous peoples\" evolved into a political term that refers to ethnic groups with historical ties to groups that existed in a territory prior to [[colonization]] or formation of a [[nation state]]. In the Americas, the term \"Indigenous peoples of the Americas\" was adopted, and the term is tailored to specific geographic or political regions, such as \"[[Indigenous peoples of Panama]]\". \"'Indigenous peoples' ... is a term that internationalizes the experiences, the issues and the struggles of some of the world's colonized peoples\", writes [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] educator [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith]]. \"The final 's' in 'indigenous peoples' ... [is] a way of recognizing that there are real differences between different indigenous peoples.\"<ref>Smith, p. 7</ref>\n\n===Turtle Islander===\nAnother, less commonly used term is in reference to the continent: [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. Though officially named [[North America]], a number of histories from various Turtle Island countries make reference to the continent existing atop a turtle's back. Though not present across all nations and countries, this symbolism and icon has spread to become nearly pan-Indigenous.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, representatives of the relatively new United States government often used the term in official records when referring to Indian nations (e.g., Justice Baldwin's concurring opinion in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Cherokee Nation v. Georgia |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=30&invol=1 |publisher=United States Supreme Court |year=1831}}</ref>).
