[[Doug Liman]] directed the film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese [[light novel]] ''[[All You Need Is Kill]]'' by [[Hiroshi Sakurazaka]]. The film takes place in a future where most of Europe is invaded by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a [[public relations officer]] with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a [[landing operation]] against the aliens. Though Cage is killed in combat, he finds himself in a [[time loop]] that sends him back to the day ''preceding'' the battle every time he dies, with some memory of events. Cage teams up with [[Special Forces]] warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt) to improve his fighting skills through the repeated days, while looking for a way to defeat the extraterrestrial invaders.\n\nIn late 2009, {{nowrap|[[3 Arts]]}} Entertainment purchased the rights to the Japanese novel and sold a [[spec script]] to the American studio [[Warner Bros.]] The studio produced the film with the involvement of {{nowrap|3 Arts}}, the novel's publisher [[Viz Media]], and Australian production company [[Village Roadshow]]. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|WB Studios in Leavesden]], outside London, and other locations, such as London's [[Trafalgar Square]] and the coastal [[Saunton Sands]]. A total of nine companies handled the [[visual effects]].\n\nWarner Bros. spent over $100 million advertising the film. It was released in cinemas on the weekend of {{nowrap|May 30}}, 2014, in 28 territories, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Indonesia. On the weekend of {{nowrap|June 6}}, it was released in 36 additional territories, including North America (United States and Canada), Australia, China, and Russia. The film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the plot, action sequences and performances of Cruise and Blunt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/tom-cruise-best-movies-of-the-decade-imdb/10/?v=6&n=f|title=Edge Of Tomorrow - 7.9|date=2019-12-06|website=SCREENRANT|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run.<ref name=\"bom\" /> A sequel, titled ''Live Die Repeat and Repeat'', is in development.\nIt's also a comedy.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2015, aliens called \"Mimics\" arrive in [[Germany]] via an asteroid and swiftly conquer most of [[continental Europe]]. By 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF), a global military alliance established to combat the alien threat, finally achieves a victory over the Mimics at [[Verdun]] using newly developed [[Powered exoskeleton|mech-suits]]. In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) orders Major William Cage ([[Tom Cruise]]) of the media relations department to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham should the invasion fail. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to [[Heathrow Airport]], now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a [[private (rank)|private]] and assigned him to Master Sergeant Farell ([[Bill Paxton]]) and the misfit J-[[Squad]], who do not take kindly to Cage.\n\nThe invasion is a colossal failure; Farell and J-Squad are quickly killed. Cage uses a [[M18 Claymore mine|Claymore mine]] to kill an unusually large blue Mimic, but brutally dies when the alien's blood dissolves him. Cage suddenly jolts awake to find himself back at Heathrow reliving the events of the previous morning. His attempts to warn Farell against the invasion are ignored, and he repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow again and again. With each loop, he becomes increasingly skilled in combat. During one loop, Cage tries to save Sergeant Rita Vrataski ([[Emily Blunt]]), a celebrated hero of the battle of Verdun. She realizes Cage can loop time and orders him to find her the next time he wakes up.\n\nCage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter ([[Noah Taylor]]), an expert in Mimic biology. He explains that the Mimics are a [[superorganism]] in which the \"Omega\" controls the [[cerebrum]], while the \"Alphas\" behave as the [[Ganglion|ganglia]] through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; If an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and rearranges its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently \"hijacked\" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before she was wounded and received a [[blood transfusion]], losing the power. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega to end the alien invasion.\n\nOver many more loops, Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat; After a frustrating lesson, Cage escapes to London, only to discover that the Mimics will attack there next after the invasion. After seeing visions of a dam in Germany where the Omega is hiding and spending many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam, Cage grows closer to Vrataski, but she is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where Vrataski is killed no matter what they do, Cage flies to the dam alone. Instead of finding the Omega, he is ambushed by an Alpha who attempts to strip him of his ability to reset time, but Cage deliberately drowns himself.\n\nCage and Vrataski infiltrate the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Property portfolio|Ministry of Defence]], where Cage compels Brigham to give him Carter's prototype device that can locate the Omega. In the ensuing car chase, they discover the Omega is under the [[Louvre Pyramid]] in [[Paris]]. Cage is captured and seriously injured, waking in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and lost the ability to loop time.\n\nVrataski frees Cage and they recruit J-Squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can reach the Louvre. Before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. When the Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, he manages to drop a belt of [[grenade|grenades]] that destroys the Omega, killing the Alpha and the Mimics.\n\nAs a dying Cage floats down into the Omega's blood, he awakens ''en route'' to his first meeting with Brigham, who announces on TV that Mimic activity has ceased following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage goes to Heathrow, back as a Major, and sees that all of J-Squad is alive. He then finds Vrataski, who greets him as icily as she did in previous loops, causing Cage to chuckle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Major William Cage\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Sergeant Rita Vrataski, the \"Angel of Verdun\"\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Master Sergeant Farell\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as General Brigham\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Dr. Carter\n* [[Jonas Armstrong]] as Skinner\n* [[Tony Way]] as Kimmel\n* [[Kick Gurry]] as Griff\n* [[Charlotte Riley]] as Nance\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Ford\n* [[Dragomir Mrsic]] as Kuntz\n* [[Masayoshi Haneda]] as Takeda\n* [[Madeleine Mantock]] as Julie\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Crew==\n[[File:Doug Liman avp 2014.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Doug Liman in front of a steel beam.|Director Doug Liman at the Paris premiere of the film]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Doug Liman]] \u2013 director\n* [[Christopher McQuarrie]] \u2013 co-writer\n* [[Jez Butterworth]] \u2013 co-writer\n* [[John-Henry Butterworth]] \u2013 co-writer\n* [[Erwin Stoff]] \u2013 producer\n* Tom Lassally \u2013 producer\n* Jeffrey Silver \u2013 producer\n* [[Gregory Jacobs]] \u2013 producer\n* Jason Hoffs \u2013 producer\n* [[Dion Beebe]] \u2013 cinematographer\n* Oliver Scholl \u2013 production designer\n* Kate Hawley \u2013 costume designer\n* James Herbert \u2013 editor\n* Laura Jennings \u2013 editor\n* [[Christophe Beck]] \u2013 composer\n* [[Nick Davis (special effects)|Nick Davis]] \u2013 visual effects supervisor\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[Viz Media]] published the novel in North America in 2009.

[[Doug Liman]] directed the film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese [[light novel]] ''[[All You Need Is Kill]]'' by [[Hiroshi Sakurazaka]]. The film takes place in a future where most of Europe is invaded by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a [[public relations officer]] with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a [[landing operation]] against the aliens. Though Cage is killed in combat, he finds himself in a [[time loop]] that sends him back to the day ''preceding'' the battle every time he dies, with some memory of events. Cage teams up with [[Special Forces]] warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt) to improve his fighting skills through the repeated days, while looking for a way to defeat the extraterrestrial invaders.\n\nIn late 2009, {{nowrap|[[3 Arts]]}} Entertainment purchased the rights to the Japanese novel and sold a [[spec script]] to the American studio [[Warner Bros.]] The studio produced the film with the involvement of {{nowrap|3 Arts}}, the novel's publisher [[Viz Media]], and Australian production company [[Village Roadshow]]. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|WB Studios in Leavesden]], outside London, and other locations, such as London's [[Trafalgar Square]] and the coastal [[Saunton Sands]]. A total of nine companies handled the [[visual effects]].\n\nWarner Bros. spent over $100 million advertising the film. It was released in cinemas on the weekend of {{nowrap|May 30}}, 2014, in 28 territories, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Indonesia. On the weekend of {{nowrap|June 6}}, it was released in 36 additional territories, including North America (United States and Canada), Australia, China, and Russia. The film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the plot, action sequences and performances of Cruise and Blunt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/tom-cruise-best-movies-of-the-decade-imdb/10/?v=6&n=f|title=Edge Of Tomorrow - 7.9|date=2019-12-06|website=SCREENRANT|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run.<ref name=\"bom\" /> A sequel, titled ''Live Die Repeat and Repeat'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2015, aliens called \"Mimics\" arrive in [[Germany]] via an asteroid and swiftly conquer most of [[continental Europe]]. By 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF), a global military alliance established to combat the alien threat, finally achieves a victory over the Mimics at [[Verdun]] using newly developed [[Powered exoskeleton|mech-suits]]. In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) orders Major William Cage ([[Tom Cruise]]) of the media relations department to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham should the invasion fail. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to [[Heathrow Airport]], now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a [[private (rank)|private]] and assigned him to Master Sergeant Farell ([[Bill Paxton]]) and the misfit J-[[Squad]], who do not take kindly to Cage.\n\nThe invasion is a colossal failure; Farell and J-Squad are quickly killed. Cage uses a [[M18 Claymore mine|Claymore mine]] to kill an unusually large blue Mimic, but brutally dies when the alien's blood dissolves him. Cage suddenly jolts awake to find himself back at Heathrow reliving the events of the previous morning. His attempts to warn Farell against the invasion are ignored, and he repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow again and again. With each loop, he becomes increasingly skilled in combat. During one loop, Cage tries to save Sergeant Rita Vrataski ([[Emily Blunt]]), a celebrated hero of the battle of Verdun. She realizes Cage can loop time and orders him to find her the next time he wakes up.\n\nCage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter ([[Noah Taylor]]), an expert in Mimic biology. He explains that the Mimics are a [[superorganism]] in which the \"Omega\" controls the [[cerebrum]], while the \"Alphas\" behave as the [[Ganglion|ganglia]] through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; If an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and rearranges its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently \"hijacked\" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before she was wounded and received a [[blood transfusion]], losing the power. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega to end the alien invasion.\n\nOver many more loops, Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat; After a frustrating lesson, Cage escapes to London, only to discover that the Mimics will attack there next after the invasion. After seeing visions of a dam in Germany where the Omega is hiding and spending many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam, Cage grows closer to Vrataski, but she is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where Vrataski is killed no matter what they do, Cage flies to the dam alone. Instead of finding the Omega, he is ambushed by an Alpha who attempts to strip him of his ability to reset time, but Cage deliberately drowns himself.\n\nCage and Vrataski infiltrate the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Property portfolio|Ministry of Defence]], where Cage compels Brigham to give him Carter's prototype device that can locate the Omega. In the ensuing car chase, they discover the Omega is under the [[Louvre Pyramid]] in [[Paris]]. Cage is captured and seriously injured, waking in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and lost the ability to loop time.\n\nVrataski frees Cage and they recruit J-Squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can reach the Louvre. Before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. When the Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, he manages to drop a belt of [[grenade|grenades]] that destroys the Omega, killing the Alpha and the Mimics.\n\nAs a dying Cage floats down into the Omega's blood, he awakens ''en route'' to his first meeting with Brigham, who announces on TV that Mimic activity has ceased following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage goes to Heathrow, back as a Major, and sees that all of J-Squad is alive.

Joining them was managing editor Jack Nessel, Felker's number-two at the ''Herald Tribune.'' ''New York'''s first issue was dated April 8, 1968.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alex French|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|accessdate=August 10, 2015|work=Mental Floss}}</ref> Among the by-lines were many familiar names from the magazine's earlier incarnation, including Breslin, Wolfe (who wrote \"You and Your Big Mouth: How the Honks and Wonks Reveal the Phonetic Truth about Status\" in the inaugural issue<ref>{{cite web|last=French|first=Alex|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>), and [[George Goodman]], a financial writer who wrote as \"[[Adam Smith]]\".\n\nWithin a year, Felker had assembled a team of contributors who would come to define the magazine's voice. Breslin became a regular, as did [[Gloria Steinem]], who wrote the city-politics column, and [[Gail Sheehy]]. (Sheehy would eventually marry Felker, in 1984.) [[Harold Clurman]] was hired as the theater critic. [[Judith Crist]] wrote movie reviews. [[Alan Rich]] covered the classical-music scene. [[Barbara Goldsmith]] was a Founding Editor of ''New York'' magazine and the author of the widely imitated series, \"The Creative Environment\", in which she interviewed such subjects as [[Marcel Breuer]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[George Balanchine]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] about their creative process. [[Gael Greene]], writing under the rubric \"The Insatiable Critic\", reviewed [[restaurant]]s, cultivating a [[baroque]] writing style that leaned heavily on sexual [[metaphor]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[Woody Allen]] contributed a few stories for the magazine in its early years.

The article described a benefit party for the [[Black Panthers]], held in [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s apartment, in a collision of [[high culture]] and low that paralleled ''New York'' magazine's ethos.

For the first year of the magazine's existence, the composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] contributed an extremely complex [[cryptic crossword]] to every third issue. In the style of British crosswords (as they are sometimes called), the cryptic crosswords feature clues that include a straight definition and a wordplay definition. [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] took over thereafter. Since 1980, the magazine has also run an American-style crossword. For the first 30 years the puzzle was always by [[Maura Jacobson]], but beginning in the summer of 2010, Cathy Allis Millhauser's byline began appearing in alternate weeks, and the magazine announced her as permanent co-constructor in September 2010. Jacobson retired in April 2011, having created 1,400 puzzles for the magazine, including 30 years when she wrote a puzzle every single week without missing an issue.<ref>Staff. [http://nymag.com/nymag/letters/maura-jacobson-retiring-2011-5/ \"An Appreciation: Thirty-one Down; After three decades\u2013plus of puzzle-making, Maura B.

Accessed January 1, 2018. \"Maura had been working for Cue for two and a half years, and in the issue of May 19, 1980, her byline first appeared on our back page. In three decades (until she dropped back to alternating weeks a year ago), she has never skipped an issue, not once.\"</ref> The cryptic crosswords were eventually dropped.\n\nIn the remaining two weeks out of every three, Sondheim's friend Mary Ann Madden edited<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 52)</ref> an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: \"Requiescat in Apache.\") Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included [[David Mamet]], [[Herb Sargent]], and [[Dan Greenburg]]. [[David Halberstam]] once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Sondheim, [[Woody Allen]], and [[Nora Ephron]] were fans.\n\nThe Competition's demise, when Madden retired, was greatly lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the magazine published a letter from an Irish contestant, John O'Byrne, who wrote: \"How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one-letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!).\" Many entrants have since migrated to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s similar \"[[The Style Invitational|Style Invitational]]\" feature.  Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled ''Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise'', ''Son of Giant Sea Tortoise'', and ''Maybe He's Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions''.\n\n==Digital expansion and destination sites==\nIn 2006, ''New York''{{'}}s website, nymag.com, underwent a year-long relaunch, transforming the site from a magazine companion to an up-to-the-minute news and service destination.

Design director Chris Dixon and photography director Jody Quon were named \"Design Team of the Year\" by [[Adweek]] in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, after [[Bruce Wasserstein]]'s death, the magazine's ownership passed to his family. Many obituaries noted Wasserstein's revival of the magazine. \"While previous owners had required constant features in the magazine about the best place to get a croissant or a beret,\" wrote [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"it was clear that Wasserstein wanted a publication that was the best place to learn about the complicated apparatus that is modern New York.

For the first year of the magazine's existence, the composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] contributed an extremely complex [[cryptic crossword]] to every third issue. In the style of British crosswords (as they are sometimes called), the cryptic crosswords feature clues that include a straight definition and a wordplay definition. [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] took over thereafter. Since 1980, the magazine has also run an American-style crossword. For the first 30 years the puzzle was always by [[Maura Jacobson]], but beginning in the summer of 2010, Cathy Allis Millhauser's byline began appearing in alternate weeks, and the magazine announced her as permanent co-constructor in September 2010. Jacobson retired in April 2011, having created 1,400 puzzles for the magazine, including 30 years when she wrote a puzzle every single week without missing an issue.<ref>Staff. [http://nymag.com/nymag/letters/maura-jacobson-retiring-2011-5/ \"An Appreciation: Thirty-one Down; After three decades\u2013plus of puzzle-making, Maura B. Jacobson is retiring.\"], ''New York'', April 24, 2011. Accessed January 1, 2018. \"Maura had been working for Cue for two and a half years, and in the issue of May 19, 1980, her byline first appeared on our back page. In three decades (until she dropped back to alternating weeks a year ago), she has never skipped an issue, not once.\"</ref> The cryptic crosswords were eventually dropped.\n\nIn the remaining two weeks out of every three, Sondheim's friend Mary Ann Madden edited<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 52)</ref> an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: \"Requiescat in Apache.\") Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included [[David Mamet]], [[Herb Sargent]], and [[Dan Greenburg]]. [[David Halberstam]] once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Sondheim, [[Woody Allen]], and [[Nora Ephron]] were fans.\n\nThe Competition's demise, when Madden retired, was greatly lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the magazine published a letter from an Irish contestant, John O'Byrne, who wrote: \"How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one-letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!).\" Many entrants have since migrated to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s similar \"[[The Style Invitational|Style Invitational]]\" feature.  Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled ''Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise'', ''Son of Giant Sea Tortoise'', and ''Maybe He's Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions''.\n\n==Digital expansion and destination sites==\nIn 2006, ''New York''{{'}}s website, nymag.com, underwent a year-long relaunch, transforming the site from a magazine companion to an up-to-the-minute news and service destination.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Lee was ignorant of the changes that had occurred during his sixteen-month captivity; he was not aware of what Washington believed to be a [[Conway Cabal|conspiracy]] to install General [[Horatio Gates]] as commander-in-chief or of the reformation of the Continental Army under the tutelage of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]].<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 110, 113</ref> Lee was not impressed by what he saw; he allegedly claimed the army to be \"in a worse situation than he expected\" and described Washington as \"not fit to command a sergeant's guard.\" While in York, he lobbied Congress for promotion to [[lieutenant general]], and went above Washington's head to submit to it a plan for reorganizing the army in a way that was markedly different from that which Washington had worked long to implement.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 114\u2013117</ref>\n\nLee's suggestion was for a militia army that avoided competing with a professional enemy in a pitched battle and relied instead on a defensive strategy which would wear down an opposing army with harassing, small-unit actions.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 119\u2013120</ref> After completing his parole, Lee returned to duty with the Continental Army as Washington's second-in-command on May 21.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> In June, as the British evacuated Philadelphia and marched through New Jersey en route to New York, Washington twice convened war councils to discuss the best course of action. In both, his generals largely agreed that Washington should avoid a major battle, Lee arguing that such a battle would be criminal, though a minority favored a limited engagement. At the second council, Lee argued the Continental Army was no match for the British Army, and favored allowing the British to proceed unimpeded and waiting until French military intervention following the [[Franco-American alliance]] could shift the balance in favor of the Americans.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 101, 173</ref>\n\nWashington agreed with the minority of his generals who favored an aggressive but limited action. He allocated some 4,500 troops, approximately a third of his army, to a [[vanguard]] that could land a heavy blow on the British without risking his army in a general engagement. The main body would follow and provide support if circumstances warranted.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 174\u2013177, 234</ref> He offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee turned the job down on the basis that the force was too small for a man of his rank and position.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 176</ref> Washington gave the position to Major General the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].

Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew the British were on the move, in the hope of catching their rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about British intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191\u2013193</ref>\n\n====Lee's battle====\n[File:Battle of Monmouth - American vanguard attack.png|thumb|upright=2|Lee's attack on the British rearguard|alt=map]\nWhen news arrived at 05:00 on June 28 that the British were moving, Lee led the vanguard towards Monmouth Court House, where he discovered the British rearguard, which he estimated at around 2,000 troops. He ordered Brigadier General [[Anthony Wayne]] with some 550 men to fix the rearguard in place while he led the remainder of the vanguard on a left hook with the intention of outflanking the British, but he neglected to inform his subordinates, Brigadier General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]] and Brigadier General [[William Maxwell (Continental Army general)|William Maxwell]], of his plan.

They became concerned that the arriving British troops would isolate them, and decided to withdraw.

With his troops withdrawing without orders, it became clear to Lee that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realised his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority became the safety of his troops in the face of superior numbers, and he ordered a general retreat.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 266\u2013269</ref>\n\nAlthough Lee had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and could exercise only limited command and control of the vanguard, at unit level the retreat was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben's training, and the Americans suffered few casualties. Lee believed he had conducted a model \"retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy\" and claimed his troops moved with \"order and precision.\" He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker's house. When two of General Washington's aides informed Lee that the main body was still some {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=on|0}} away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied \"that he really did not know what to say.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 268\u2013272</ref> Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 178</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - American rearguard.png|thumb|left|upright=2|American rearguard action|alt=map]]\nWithout any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned as he approached the battlefield with the main body shortly after midday. In the space of some ten minutes, his confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee's retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of a bridge over the Spotswood Middle Brook.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 281\u2013286</ref>\n\nExpecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, \"I desire to know, sir, what is the reason&nbsp;\u2013 whence arises this disorder and confusion?\"<ref name=\"Lender&Stone289\">Lender & Stone 2016 p. 289</ref> When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place.<ref name=\"Lender&Stone289 \"/><ref name=\"Chernow448\">Chernow 2010 p. 448</ref> Washington was not convinced; \"All this may be very true, sir,\" he replied, \"but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\"<ref name=\"Lender&Stone289 \"/> Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 289\u2013290</ref>{{efn|According to Lender & Stone, the encounter between Washington and Lee \"became part of the folklore of the Revolution, with various witnesses (or would-be witnesses) taking increasing dramatic license with their stories over the years.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 290</ref> Ferling writes of eyewitness testimony in which a furious Washington, swearing \"till the leaves shook on the trees\" according to Scott, called Lee a \"damned poltroon\" and relieved him of command.<ref name=\"Ferling179 \"/> Chernow reports the same quote from Scott, quotes Lafayette to assert that a \"terribly excited\" Washington swore and writes that Washington \"banished [Lee] to the rear.\"<ref name=\"Chernow448 \"/> Bilby & Jenkins attribute the poltroon quote to Lafayette, then write that neither Scott nor Lafayette were present.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 205</ref> Lender & Stone are also skeptical, and assert that such stories are apocryphal nonsense which first appeared almost a half century or more after the event, that Scott was too far away to have heard what was said, and that Lee himself never accused Washington of profanity. According to Lender & Stone, \"careful scholarship has conclusively demonstrated that Washington was angry but not profane at Monmouth, and he never ordered Lee off the field.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 290\u2013291</ref>}}\n\nWith the main body still arriving and the British no more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=on|0}} away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. He then offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back across the bridge and organize the main defenses on Perrine's Hill. Lee opted for the former while Washington departed to take care of the latter.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 291\u2013295</ref><ref name=\"Ferling179\">Ferling 2009 p. 179</ref> Lee fought the counter-attacking British in a rearguard action that lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body, and at 13:30, he was one of the last American officers to withdraw across the bridge.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 298\u2013310, 313</ref> When Lee reached Perrine's Hill, Washington sent him with part of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. At 15:00, Steuben arrived at Englishtown and relieved Lee of command.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 315\u2013316</ref>\n\n====Court martial====\nEven before the day was out, Lee was cast in the role of villain, and his vilification became an integral part of after-battle reports written by Washington's officers.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 391\u2013392</ref> Lee continued in his post as second-in-command immediately after the battle, and it is likely that the issue would have simply subsided if he had let it go. But on June 30, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed \"dirty earwigs\" for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day and pronounced Washington to be \"guilty of an act of cruel injustice\" towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee's letter was \"highly improper\" and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee's conduct. Lee's response demanding a [[court-martial]] was again insolent, and Washington ordered his arrest and set about obliging him.<ref name=\"Ferling 2009 p. 180\">Ferling 2009 p. 180</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 452</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 392\u2013393</ref>\n\nThe court convened on July 4, and three charges were laid before Lee: disobeying orders in not attacking on the morning of the battle, contrary to \"repeated instructions\"; conducting an \"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\"; and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. The trial concluded on August 12, but the accusations and counter-accusations continued to fly until the verdict was confirmed by Congress on December 5.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 395\u2013396, 400</ref> his defense was articulate but fatally flawed by his efforts to turn it into a personal contest between Lee and Washington. He denigrated the commander-in-chief's role in the battle, calling Washington's official account \"from beginning to end a most abominable damn'd lie\", and disingenuously cast his own decision to retreat as a \"masterful manoeuvre\" designed to lure the British onto the main body.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 396, 397, 399</ref> Washington remained aloof from the controversy, but his allies portrayed Lee as a traitor who had allowed the British to escape and linked him to the previous winter's alleged conspiracy against Washington.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 397\u2013399</ref>\n\nAlthough the first two charges proved to be dubious,{{efn|According to the court-martial transcript, Lee's actions had saved a significant portion of the army.<ref name=\"Ferling 2009 p. 180\"/> Both Scott and Wayne testified that although they understood Washington wanted Lee to attack, at no stage did he explicitly give Lee an order to do so.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Hamilton testified that as he understood it, Washington's instructions allowed Lee the discretion to act as circumstances dictated.<ref name=\"Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194\">Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194</ref> Lender and Stone identify two separate orders Washington issued to Lee on the morning of June 28 in which the commander-in-chief made clear his expectation that Lee should attack unless \"some very powerful circumstance\" dictate otherwise and that Lee should \"proceed with caution and take care the Enemy don't draw him into a scrape.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 195\u2013196</ref>}} Lee was undeniably guilty of disrespect, and Washington was too powerful to cross.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 396</ref> As the historian John Shy noted, \"Under the circumstances, an acquittal on the first two charges would have been a vote of no-confidence in Washington.\"<ref>Shy 1973, cited in Lender & Stone 2016, p. 396</ref> Lee was found guilty on all three counts, though the court deleted \"shameful\" from the second and noted the retreat was \"disorderly\" only \"in some few instances.\" Lee was suspended from the army for a year, a sentence so lenient that some interpreted it as a vindication of all but the charge of disrespect.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 396\u2013397</ref> Lee continued to argue his case and rage against Washington to anyone who would listen, prompting both Lieutenant Colonel [[John Laurens]], one of Washington's aides, and Steuben to challenge him to a duel. Only the duel with Laurens actually transpired, during which Lee was wounded. In 1780, Lee sent such an obnoxious letter to Congress that it terminated his service with the army.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 180\u2013181</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 400\u2013401</ref><ref> Chernow 2010 p. 455</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:General Charles Lee.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lee was very fond of dogs, and was seldom seen without half a dozen at his heels.]]\nLee retired to his [[Prato Rio]] property in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], where he bred horses and dogs.<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"appleton\"/> While visiting [[Philadelphia]], he was stricken with fever and died<ref name=\"anb\"/> in a tavern on October 2, 1782.<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"appleton\"/> He was buried there in the churchyard of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]].<ref name=\"anb\"/><ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"appleton\"/> Lee left his property to his sister, Sidney Lee, who died unmarried in 1788.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], on the west side of the [[Hudson River]] (across the water from [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington, New York]]), was named for him during his life.

Lee was ignorant of the changes that had occurred during his sixteen-month captivity; he was not aware of what Washington believed to be a [[Conway Cabal|conspiracy]] to install General [[Horatio Gates]] as commander-in-chief or of the reformation of the Continental Army under the tutelage of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]].<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 110, 113</ref> Lee was not impressed by what he saw; he allegedly claimed the army to be \"in a worse situation than he expected\" and described Washington as \"not fit to command a sergeant's guard.\" While in York, he lobbied Congress for promotion to [[lieutenant general]], and went above Washington's head to submit to it a plan for reorganizing the army in a way that was markedly different from that which Washington had worked long to implement.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 114\u2013117</ref>\n\nLee's suggestion was for a militia army that avoided competing with a professional enemy in a pitched battle and relied instead on a defensive strategy which would wear down an opposing army with harassing, small-unit actions.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 119\u2013120</ref> After completing his parole, Lee returned to duty with the Continental Army as Washington's second-in-command on May 21.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> In June, as the British evacuated Philadelphia and marched through New Jersey en route to New York, Washington twice convened war councils to discuss the best course of action. In both, his generals largely agreed that Washington should avoid a major battle, Lee arguing that such a battle would be criminal, though a minority favored a limited engagement. At the second council, Lee argued the Continental Army was no match for the British Army, and favored allowing the British to proceed unimpeded and waiting until French military intervention following the [[Franco-American alliance]] could shift the balance in favor of the Americans.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 101, 173</ref>\n\nWashington agreed with the minority of his generals who favored an aggressive but limited action. He allocated some 4,500 troops, approximately a third of his army, to a [[vanguard]] that could land a heavy blow on the British without risking his army in a general engagement. The main body would follow and provide support if circumstances warranted.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 174\u2013177, 234</ref> He offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee turned the job down on the basis that the force was too small for a man of his rank and position.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 176</ref> Washington gave the position to Major General the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]. In his haste to catch the British, Lafayette pushed the vanguard to exhaustion and outran his supplies, prompting Washington to send Lee, who had in the meantime changed his mind, to replace him.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 178\u2013182, 187, 188</ref>\n\nLee took over on June 27 at [[Englishtown, New Jersey|Englishtown]].<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 188</ref> The British were at Monmouth Court House (modern-day [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]]), {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=on|0}} from Englishtown.

Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew the British were on the move, in the hope of catching their rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about British intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191\u2013193</ref>\n\n====Lee's battle====\n[File:Battle of Monmouth - American vanguard attack.png|thumb|upright=2|Lee's attack on the British rearguard|alt=map]\nWhen news arrived at 05:00 on June 28 that the British were moving, Lee led the vanguard towards Monmouth Court House, where he discovered the British rearguard, which he estimated at around 2,000 troops. He ordered Brigadier General [[Anthony Wayne]] with some 550 men to fix the rearguard in place while he led the remainder of the vanguard on a left hook with the intention of outflanking the British, but he neglected to inform his subordinates, Brigadier General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]] and Brigadier General [[William Maxwell (Continental Army general)|William Maxwell]], of his plan. Lee's confidence crept into reports back to Washington that implied \"the certainty of success.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 198, 253\u2013255, 261</ref>\n\nAs soon as the British commander, General Sir [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]], received news that his rearguard was being probed, he ordered his main combat division to march back towards Monmouth Court House.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 264\u2013265</ref> Lee became concerned that his right flank would be vulnerable and moved with Lafayette's detachment to secure it.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 262\u2013264</ref> To his left, Scott and Maxwell were not in communication with Lee and not privy to his plan. They became concerned that the arriving British troops would isolate them, and decided to withdraw. To their left, Wayne's isolated troops, having witnessed the British marching back, were also withdrawing.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 264\u2013266</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 199</ref> Lee witnessed one of Lafayette's units pulling back after a failed attempt to silence some British artillery around the same time as one of his staff officers returned with the news that Scott had withdrawn. With his troops withdrawing without orders, it became clear to Lee that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realised his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority became the safety of his troops in the face of superior numbers, and he ordered a general retreat.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 266\u2013269</ref>\n\nAlthough Lee had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and could exercise only limited command and control of the vanguard, at unit level the retreat was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben's training, and the Americans suffered few casualties. Lee believed he had conducted a model \"retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy\" and claimed his troops moved with \"order and precision.\" He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker's house. When two of General Washington's aides informed Lee that the main body was still some {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=on|0}} away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied \"that he really did not know what to say.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 268\u2013272</ref> Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 178</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - American rearguard.png|thumb|left|upright=2|American rearguard action|alt=map]]\nWithout any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned as he approached the battlefield with the main body shortly after midday. In the space of some ten minutes, his confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee's retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of a bridge over the Spotswood Middle Brook.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 281\u2013286</ref>\n\nExpecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, \"I desire to know, sir, what is the reason&nbsp;\u2013 whence arises this disorder and confusion?\"<ref name=\"Lender&Stone289\">Lender & Stone 2016 p. 289</ref> When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place.<ref name=\"Lender&Stone289 \"/><ref name=\"Chernow448\">Chernow 2010 p. 448</ref> Washington was not convinced; \"All this may be very true, sir,\" he replied, \"but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\"<ref name=\"Lender&Stone289 \"/> Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 289\u2013290</ref>{{efn|According to Lender & Stone, the encounter between Washington and Lee \"became part of the folklore of the Revolution, with various witnesses (or would-be witnesses) taking increasing dramatic license with their stories over the years.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 290</ref> Ferling writes of eyewitness testimony in which a furious Washington, swearing \"till the leaves shook on the trees\" according to Scott, called Lee a \"damned poltroon\" and relieved him of command.<ref name=\"Ferling179 \"/> Chernow reports the same quote from Scott, quotes Lafayette to assert that a \"terribly excited\" Washington swore and writes that Washington \"banished [Lee] to the rear.\"<ref name=\"Chernow448 \"/> Bilby & Jenkins attribute the poltroon quote to Lafayette, then write that neither Scott nor Lafayette were present.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 205</ref> Lender & Stone are also skeptical, and assert that such stories are apocryphal nonsense which first appeared almost a half century or more after the event, that Scott was too far away to have heard what was said, and that Lee himself never accused Washington of profanity. According to Lender & Stone, \"careful scholarship has conclusively demonstrated that Washington was angry but not profane at Monmouth, and he never ordered Lee off the field.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 290\u2013291</ref>}}\n\nWith the main body still arriving and the British no more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=on|0}} away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. He then offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back across the bridge and organize the main defenses on Perrine's Hill. Lee opted for the former while Washington departed to take care of the latter.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 291\u2013295</ref><ref name=\"Ferling179\">Ferling 2009 p. 179</ref> Lee fought the counter-attacking British in a rearguard action that lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body, and at 13:30, he was one of the last American officers to withdraw across the bridge.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 298\u2013310, 313</ref> When Lee reached Perrine's Hill, Washington sent him with part of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. At 15:00, Steuben arrived at Englishtown and relieved Lee of command.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 315\u2013316</ref>\n\n====Court martial====\nEven before the day was out, Lee was cast in the role of villain, and his vilification became an integral part of after-battle reports written by Washington's officers.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 391\u2013392</ref> Lee continued in his post as second-in-command immediately after the battle, and it is likely that the issue would have simply subsided if he had let it go. But on June 30, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed \"dirty earwigs\" for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day and pronounced Washington to be \"guilty of an act of cruel injustice\" towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee's letter was \"highly improper\" and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee's conduct. Lee's response demanding a [[court-martial]] was again insolent, and Washington ordered his arrest and set about obliging him.<ref name=\"Ferling 2009 p. 180\">Ferling 2009 p. 180</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 452</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 392\u2013393</ref>\n\nThe court convened on July 4, and three charges were laid before Lee: disobeying orders in not attacking on the morning of the battle, contrary to \"repeated instructions\"; conducting an \"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\"; and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. The trial concluded on August 12, but the accusations and counter-accusations continued to fly until the verdict was confirmed by Congress on December 5.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 395\u2013396, 400</ref> his defense was articulate but fatally flawed by his efforts to turn it into a personal contest between Lee and Washington. He denigrated the commander-in-chief's role in the battle, calling Washington's official account \"from beginning to end a most abominable damn'd lie\", and disingenuously cast his own decision to retreat as a \"masterful manoeuvre\" designed to lure the British onto the main body.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 396, 397, 399</ref> Washington remained aloof from the controversy, but his allies portrayed Lee as a traitor who had allowed the British to escape and linked him to the previous winter's alleged conspiracy against Washington.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 397\u2013399</ref>\n\nAlthough the first two charges proved to be dubious,{{efn|According to the court-martial transcript, Lee's actions had saved a significant portion of the army.<ref name=\"Ferling 2009 p. 180\"/> Both Scott and Wayne testified that although they understood Washington wanted Lee to attack, at no stage did he explicitly give Lee an order to do so.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Hamilton testified that as he understood it, Washington's instructions allowed Lee the discretion to act as circumstances dictated.<ref name=\"Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194\">Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194</ref> Lender and Stone identify two separate orders Washington issued to Lee on the morning of June 28 in which the commander-in-chief made clear his expectation that Lee should attack unless \"some very powerful circumstance\" dictate otherwise and that Lee should \"proceed with caution and take care the Enemy don't draw him into a scrape.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 195\u2013196</ref>}} Lee was undeniably guilty of disrespect, and Washington was too powerful to cross.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 396</ref> As the historian John Shy noted, \"Under the circumstances, an acquittal on the first two charges would have been a vote of no-confidence in Washington.\"<ref>Shy 1973, cited in Lender & Stone 2016, p. 396</ref> Lee was found guilty on all three counts, though the court deleted \"shameful\" from the second and noted the retreat was \"disorderly\" only \"in some few instances.\" Lee was suspended from the army for a year, a sentence so lenient that some interpreted it as a vindication of all but the charge of disrespect.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 396\u2013397</ref> Lee continued to argue his case and rage against Washington to anyone who would listen, prompting both Lieutenant Colonel [[John Laurens]], one of Washington's aides, and Steuben to challenge him to a duel. Only the duel with Laurens actually transpired, during which Lee was wounded. In 1780, Lee sent such an obnoxious letter to Congress that it terminated his service with the army.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 180\u2013181</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 400\u2013401</ref><ref> Chernow 2010 p. 455</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:General Charles Lee.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lee was very fond of dogs, and was seldom seen without half a dozen at his heels.]]\nLee retired to his [[Prato Rio]] property in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], where he bred horses and dogs.<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"appleton\"/> While visiting [[Philadelphia]], he was stricken with fever and died<ref name=\"anb\"/> in a tavern on October 2, 1782.<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"appleton\"/> He was buried there in the churchyard of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]].<ref name=\"anb\"/><ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref name=\"appleton\"/> Lee left his property to his sister, Sidney Lee, who died unmarried in 1788.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], on the west side of the [[Hudson River]] (across the water from [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington, New York]]), was named for him during his life.

The raising of the [[United States flag]] in Honolulu to establish American protection of the islands spurred international opposition and the British and Japanese each sent a warship to Honolulu. Over the next several weeks, the new [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]], consisting mostly of American residents of the islands, sought annexation by the [[United States]], but shortly after assuming office on 4 March 1893, President [[Grover Cleveland]], who disapproved of the overthrow, dispatched [[James H. Blount]] as a special envoy to Hawaii with authority to act on Cleveland{{'}}s behalf. Blount ordered Skerrett to have the American flag hauled down on 1 April 1893 and directed that the provisional government receive no further U.S. government support.

In 1835, [[Charles Darwin]] and {{HMS|Beagle}} called into the [[Bay of Islands]] on its epic circumnavigation of the Earth and Darwin witnessed a game of cricket played by freed M\u0101ori slaves and the son of a missionary at Waimate North. Darwin in ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' wrote:<ref>The Summer Game by D.O & P.W. Neely 1994 Page 11</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nseveral young men redeemed by the missionaires from slavery were employed on the farm. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe first recorded game of cricket in New Zealand took place in [[Wellington]] in December 1842. The ''Wellington Spectator'' reports a game on 28 December 1842 played by a \"Red\" team and a \"Blue\" team from the Wellington Club. The first fully recorded match was reported by the ''Examiner'' in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] between the Surveyors and Nelson in March 1844.\n\nThe first team to tour New Zealand was Parr's all England XI in 1863\u201364. Between 1864 and 1914, 22 foreign teams toured New Zealand. England sent 6 teams, Australia 15 and one from [[Fiji]].\n\n===First national team===\n{{See also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1890-91 to 1918}}\nOn 15\u201317 February 1894 the first team representing New Zealand played New South Wales at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. New South Wales won by 160 runs. New South Wales returned again in 1895\u201396 and New Zealand won the solitary game by 142 runs, its first victory. The New Zealand Cricket Council was formed towards the end of 1894.\n\nNew Zealand played its first two internationals (not Tests) in 1904\u201305 against a star-studded Australia team containing such players as [[Victor Trumper]], [[Warwick Armstrong]] and [[Clem Hill]]. Rain saved New Zealand from a thrashing in the first match, but not the second, which New Zealand lost by an innings and 358 runs \u2013 currently the second largest defeat in New Zealand first-class history.\n\n===Inter-war period===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1918-19 to 1945}}\nIn 1927 [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927|NZ toured England]]. They played 26 first-class matches, mostly against county sides. They won seven matches, including those against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]. On the strength of the performances of this tour New Zealand was granted [[Test status]].\n\nIn 1929/30 the [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1929\u201330|M.C.C toured NZ]] and played 4 Tests all of 3 days in duration. New Zealand lost its first Test match but drew the next 3. In the second Test [[Stewie Dempster]] and [[John Mills (cricketer, born 1905)|Jackie Mills]] put on 276 for the first wicket. This is still the highest partnership for New Zealand against England. New Zealand first played South Africa in 1931\u201332 in a three match series but were unable to secure Test matches against any teams other than England before [[World War II]] ended all Test cricket for 7 years. A Test tour by Australia, planned for February and March 1940, was cancelled after the outbreak of the war.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Australian cricket team: Tour of New Zealand |journal=Evening Star |date=8 July 1939 |page=32 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ESD19390708.2.186.31 |access-date=29 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329061707/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ESD19390708.2.186.31 |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Bradman may lead Australian team on tour of N.Z. |journal=Auckland Star |date=22 June 1939 |page=23 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19390622.2.179 |access-date=29 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329074455/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19390622.2.179 |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Australian tour abandoned: 'Difficulties caused by war' |journal=Press |date=30 November 1939 |page=12 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19391130.2.86 |access-date=29 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329074508/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19391130.2.86 |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===After World War II===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1945-46 to 1970}}\nNew Zealand's first Test after the war was against Australia in 1945/46. This game was not considered a \"Test\" at the time but it was granted Test status retrospectively by the [[International Cricket Council]] in March 1948. The New Zealand players who appeared in this match probably did not appreciate this move by the ICC as New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54. The [[New Zealand Cricket Council]]'s unwillingness to pay Australian players a decent allowance to tour New Zealand ensured that this was the only Test Australia played against New Zealand between 1929 and 1972.\n\nIn 1949 New Zealand sent one of its best ever sides to England. It contained [[Bert Sutcliffe]], [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[John Richard Reid|John R. Reid]] and [[Jack Cowie]]. However, 3-day Test matches ensured that all 4 Tests were drawn. Many have regarded the 1949 tour of England among New Zealand's best ever touring performances. All four tests were high-scoring despite being draws and Martin Donnelly's 206 at Lord's hailed as one of the finest innings ever seen there.<ref name=\"nzhistory.net.nz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/cricket-in-nz/playing-england |title=New Zealand cricket Page 4 \u2013 Playing England |publisher=NZHistory |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207072607/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/cricket-in-nz/playing-england |archive-date=7 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being winless, New Zealand did not lose a test either. Prior to this, only the legendary 1948 Australian team, led by the great [[Don Bradman]], had achieved this.\n\nNew Zealand played its first matches against the West Indies in 1951\u201352, and Pakistan and India in 1955/56.\n\nIn 1954/55 New Zealand recorded the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season New Zealand achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but New Zealand won the fourth to notch up its first Test victory. It had taken them 45 matches and 26 years to attain.\n\n{{Test match\n  | date = 9, 10, 12, 13 March 1956\n  | team1 = {{cr-rt|NZL}}\n  | score-team1-inns1 = 255 all out (166.5 overs)\n  | score-team2-inns1 = 145 all out (78.3 overs)\n  | score-team1-inns2 = 157 all out (80 overs)\n  | score-team2-inns2 = 77 all out (45.1 overs)\n  | team2 = {{cr|WIN}}\n  | runs-team1-inns1 = [[John Richard Reid|John R.

For most of this period New Zealand lacked a class bowler to lead their attack although they had two excellent batsmen in [[Bert Sutcliffe]] and [[Glenn Turner]] and a great all-rounder in [[John Richard Reid|John R. Reid]].\n\nReid captained New Zealand on a tour to South Africa in 1961\u201362 where the five test series was drawn 2\u20132. The victories in the third and fifth tests were the first overseas victories New Zealand achieved. Reid scored 1,915 runs in the tour, setting a record for the most runs scored by a touring batsman of South Africa as a result.<ref name=\"Outstanding Achievements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/cricket-mens/page-5 |title=Outstanding Achievements |publisher=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207074145/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/cricket-mens/page-5 |archive-date=7 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nNew Zealand won their first test series in their three match 1969/70 tour of Pakistan 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/engine/series/60430.html |title=New Zealand in Pakistan Test Series, 1969/70 |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326182401/http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/engine/series/60430.html |archive-date=26 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===1970 to 2000===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1970-71 to 2000}}\n[[File:Scoreboard_-_NZ_v_England,_Wellington,_February_1978.jpg|thumb|Scoreboard - [[Basin Reserve]]February 1978. NZ's first win over England]]\nIn 1973 [[Richard Hadlee]] debuted and the rate at which New Zealand won Tests picked up dramatically. Hadlee was one of the best pace bowlers of his generation, playing 86 Tests for New Zealand, before he retired in 1990. Of the 86 Tests that Hadlee played in New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. In 1977/78 New Zealand won its first Test against England, at the 48th attempt. Hadlee took 10 wickets in the match.\n\nDuring the 1980s New Zealand also had the services of one of its best ever batsman, [[Martin Crowe]] and a number of good players such as [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]], [[Bruce Edgar]], [[John Fulton Reid|John F. Reid]], [[Andrew Jones (cricketer, born 1959)|Andrew Jones]], [[Geoff Howarth]], [[Jeremy Coney]], [[Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)|Ian Smith]], [[John Bracewell]], [[Lance Cairns]], [[Stephen Boock]], and [[Ewen Chatfield]], who were capable of playing the occasional match winning performance and consistently making a valuable contribution to a Test match.\n\nThe best example of New Zealand's two star players (R. Hadlee and M. Crowe) putting in match winning performances and other players making good contributions is New Zealand versus Australia, 1985 at Brisbane. In Australia's first innings Hadlee took 9\u201352. In New Zealand's only turn at bat, M Crowe scored 188 and John F. Reid 108. Edgar, Wright, Coney, Jeff Crowe, V. Brown, and Hadlee scored between 17 and 54*. In Australia's second innings, Hadlee took 6\u201371 and Chatfield 3\u201375. New Zealand won by an innings and 41 runs.\n\n{{Test match\n| date = 8\u201312 November 1985\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 179 (76.4 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 553/7[[Declaration and forfeiture|d]] (161 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 333 (116.5 overs\n| score-team2-inns2 = \n| team2 = {{cr|NZL}}\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Kepler Wessels]] 70 (186) \n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Richard Hadlee]] 9/52 (23.4 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Martin Crowe]] 188 (328)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Greg Matthews]] 3/110 (31 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Allan Border]] 152* (301)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Richard Hadlee]] 6/71 (28.5 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns2  = \n| wickets-team2-inns2 = \n| result = New Zealand won by an innings and 41 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63415.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[The Gabba]], [[Brisbane]]\n| umpires = [[Tony Crafter]] (Aus) and [[Dick French]] (Aus)\n| motm = [[Richard Hadlee]] (NZ)\n| toss = New Zealand won the toss and elected to field.\n| notes =  \n}}\n\nOne-day cricket also gave New Zealand a chance to compete more regularly than Test cricket with the better sides in world cricket. In one-day cricket a batsman does not need to score centuries to win games for his side and bowlers do not need to bowl the opposition out. One-day games can be won by one batsman getting a 50, a few others getting 30s, bowlers bowling economically and everyone fielding well. These were requirements New Zealand players could consistently meet and thus developed a good one-day record against all sides.\n\nPerhaps New Zealand's most infamous one-day match was the \"under arm\" match against Australia at the [[Melbourne Cricket ground|MCG]] in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain [[Greg Chappell]] instructed his brother [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]] to \"bowl\" the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.\n\nWhen New Zealand next played in the tri-series in Australia in 1983, [[Lance Cairns]] became a cult hero for his one-day batting. In one match against Australia, he hit six sixes at the [[Melbourne Cricket ground|MCG]], one of the world's largest grounds. Few fans remember that New Zealand lost this game by 149 runs. However, Lance's greatest contribution to New Zealand cricket was his son [[Chris Cairns]].\n\nChris Cairns made his debut one year before Hadlee retired in 1990. Cairns, one of New Zealand's best all-rounders, led the 1990s bowling attack with [[Danny Morrison (cricketer)|Danny Morrison]]. [[Stephen Fleming]], New Zealand's most prolific scorer, led the batting and the team into the 21st century. [[Nathan Astle]] and [[Craig McMillan]] also scored plenty of runs for New Zealand, but both retired earlier than expected.\n\n[[Daniel Vettori]] made his debut as an 18-year-old in 1997, and when he took over from Fleming as captain in 2007 he was regarded as the best spinning all-rounder in world cricket. On 26 August 2009, Daniel Vettori became the eighth player and second left-arm bowler (after [[Chaminda Vaas]]) in history to take 300 wickets and score 3000 test runs, joining the illustrious club. Vettori decided to take an indefinite break from international short form cricket in 2011 but continued to represent New Zealand in Test cricket and returned for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]].\n\nOn 4 April 1996, New Zealand achieved a unique world record, where the whole team was adjudged Man of the Match for team performance against 4 run victory over the West Indies. This is recorded as the only time where whole team achieved such an award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard_ODI.asp?MatchCode=1153 |title=1995\u20131996 West Indies v New Zealand \u2013 4th Match \u2013 Georgetown, Guyana |publisher=HowStat |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144817/http://howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard_ODI.asp?MatchCode=1153 |archive-date=28 July 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI |title=4th ODI, New Zealand tour of West Indies at Georgetown, Apr 3 1996 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828194336/http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI |archive-date=28 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151262.html | title=Fourth One-Day International \u2013 WEST INDIES v NEW ZEALAND | work=Wisden 1997 | accessdate=2 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405204100/http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151262.html | archive-date=5 April 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{Limited overs international\n  | date = 3 April 1996\n  | team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n  | score1 = 158 (35.5 overs)\n  | score2 = 154 (49.1 overs)\n  | team2 = {{cr|WIN}}\n  | runs1 = [[Craig Spearman]] 41 (39)\n  | wickets1 = [[Laurie Williams (cricketer)|Laurie Williams]] 3/16 (4.5 overs)\n  | runs2 = [[Roland Holder]] 49[[not out|*]] (86)\n  | wickets2 = [[Chris Cairns]] 2/17 (5.1 overs)\n  | result = New Zealand won by 4 runs\n  | report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI Scorecard]\n  | venue = [[Bourda]], [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]\n  | umpires = [[Clyde Duncan (umpire)|Clyde Duncan]] (WI) and [[Eddie Nicholls]] (WI)\n  | motm = New Zealand\n  | toss = West Indies won the toss and elected to field.\n}}\n\n===21st century===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 2000\u201301}}\n[[File:BlackCapsResized.png|thumb|left|The Black Caps logo.]]\nNew Zealand started the new millennium by winning the [[2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy]] in Kenya to claim their first ICC tournament.

When fit, he added a dimension to the NZ bowling attack that had been missing since Hadlee retired.\n\n[[File:New Zealand cricket team, Shoaib Malik, Dunedin, NZ, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The New Zealand team celebrating a dismissal in 2009]]\n\nThe rise of the financial power of the BCCI had an immense effect on NZ cricket and its players. The BCCI managed to convince other boards not to pick players who had joined the rival Twenty-20 [[Indian Cricket League]]. NZ Cricket lost the services of [[Shane Bond]], [[Lou Vincent]], [[Andre Adams]], [[Hamish Marshall]] and [[Daryl Tuffey]]. The money to be made from Twenty-20 cricket in India may have also induced players, such as [[Craig McMillan]] and [[Scott Styris]] (from Test cricket) to retire earlier than they would have otherwise. After the demise of the Indian Cricket League Bond and Tuffey again played for New Zealand.\n\nVettori stood down as Test captain in 2011 leading to star batsman [[Ross Taylor]] to take his place. Taylor led New Zealand for a year which included a thrilling win in a low scoring Test match against Australia in [[Hobart]], their first win over Australia since 1993. In 2012/13 [[Brendon McCullum]] became captain and new players such as [[Kane Williamson]], [[Corey Anderson]], [[Doug Bracewell]], [[Trent Boult]] and [[Jimmy Neesham]] emerged as world-class performers. McCullum captained New Zealand to series wins against the West Indies and India in 2013/14 and both Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2014/15 increasing New Zealand's rankings in both Test and ODI formats. In the series against India McCullum scored 302 at Wellington to become New Zealand's first Test [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple centurion]].\n\nIn early 2015 New Zealand made the final of the Cricket World Cup, going through the tournament undefeated until the final, where they lost to Australia by seven wickets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/results|title=Results {{!}} Cricket World Cup 2015 \u2013 ICC Cricket {{!}} Official Website|website=www.icc-cricket.com|access-date=19 March 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320065120/http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/results|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the New Zealand national cricket team played under the name of [[Aotearoa]] for their first match [[New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2015|against Zimbabwe]] to celebrate [[M\u0101ori Language Week]].<ref name=\"Aotearoa\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-new-zealand-2015/content/story/903551.html |title=New Zealand to play as Aotearoa |accessdate=27 July 2015 |work=ESPNCricinfo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730011806/http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-new-zealand-2015/content/story/903551.html |archive-date=30 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2015 New Zealand toured England,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.cricbuzz.com/cricket-schedule/series/2284/new-zealand-tour-of-england-2015|title=New Zealand tour of England, 2015 schedule \u2013 Match details, time, venue \u2013 Cricbuzz|website=Cricbuzz|access-date=20 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402201714/http://m.cricbuzz.com/cricket-schedule/series/2284/new-zealand-tour-of-england-2015|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> performing well, drawing the Test series 1\u20131, and losing the One Day series, 2\u20133.\n\nFrom October to November 2015, and in February 2016, New Zealand played Australia in two Test Series, in three and two games a piece\n\nWith a changing of an era in the Australian team, New Zealand was rated as a chance of winning especially in New Zealand.

New Zealand fielders may wear a black cap (in the style of a [[baseball cap]] rather than the baggy cap worn by some teams) or a white sun hat with the New Zealand Cricket logo in the middle. Helmets are also coloured black (although until 1996, they used to be white with the silver fern logo encased in a black circle).\n\nIn [[limited overs cricket]], New Zealand's ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the ANZ logo across the centre, with the silver fern badge on the left of the shirt, Canterbury logo on the right sleeve and the Ford logo on the right. In ODIs, the kit comprises a black shirt with blue accents and black trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a beige shirt with black accents and black trousers. In [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with sponsor's logos moving to the sleeve and 'NEW ZEALAND' printed across the front.\n\nIn ODI, New Zealand wore Beige and brown between 1980 World Series Cricket and 1988 World Series Cricket. The 1983\u20131984 version was made popular by the Black Caps supporter group [[Beige Brigade]], who sells the version of this uniform to the general public together with a \"moral contract\" which explains the expectations that come with being a Beige Brigadier. and was also worn in the inaugural Twenty20 international between New Zealand and Australia. Between 1991 and 1997 grey or silver (with some splashes of black or white) was worn instead. Until 2000, the ODI uniform was teal with black accents.\n\nPrevious suppliers were Adidas (World Series Cricket 1980\u20131990), ISC (World Cup World Cup 1992 and 1996, World Series 1993\u201397) Canterbury (1998\u20131999), Asics (who supplied all the 1999 Cricket World Cup participating teams) and WStar (2000\u20132009).\n\nPrevious sponsors were [[DB Draught]] (1990\u20131994 in the front, 1995\u20131997 in the sleeve), [[Bank of New Zealand]] (1993\u201394 and 1997\u201399 in the front), [[Clear Communications]], later [[TelstraClear]] (1997\u20132000 in the front, 2001\u20132005 in the sleeve), [[National Bank of New Zealand]] (2000\u20132014) and [[Dheeraj and East Coast]] (2009\u20132010),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzcricketmuseum.co.nz/product/poster-nz-odi-shirts/|title=NZ Cricket Museum Shop - Poster: NZ ODI Shirts|accessdate=8 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908202403/http://nzcricketmuseum.co.nz/product/poster-nz-odi-shirts/|archive-date=8 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> since 2014 [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] is the current sponsor, due to National Bank's rebranding as ANZ.

In 1835, [[Charles Darwin]] and {{HMS|Beagle}} called into the [[Bay of Islands]] on its epic circumnavigation of the Earth and Darwin witnessed a game of cricket played by freed M\u0101ori slaves and the son of a missionary at Waimate North. Darwin in ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' wrote:<ref>The Summer Game by D.O & P.W. Neely 1994 Page 11</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nseveral young men redeemed by the missionaires from slavery were employed on the farm. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe first recorded game of cricket in New Zealand took place in [[Wellington]] in December 1842. The ''Wellington Spectator'' reports a game on 28 December 1842 played by a \"Red\" team and a \"Blue\" team from the Wellington Club. The first fully recorded match was reported by the ''Examiner'' in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] between the Surveyors and Nelson in March 1844.\n\nThe first team to tour New Zealand was Parr's all England XI in 1863\u201364. Between 1864 and 1914, 22 foreign teams toured New Zealand. England sent 6 teams, Australia 15 and one from [[Fiji]].\n\n===First national team===\n{{See also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1890-91 to 1918}}\nOn 15\u201317 February 1894 the first team representing New Zealand played New South Wales at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. New South Wales won by 160 runs. New South Wales returned again in 1895\u201396 and New Zealand won the solitary game by 142 runs, its first victory. The New Zealand Cricket Council was formed towards the end of 1894.\n\nNew Zealand played its first two internationals (not Tests) in 1904\u201305 against a star-studded Australia team containing such players as [[Victor Trumper]], [[Warwick Armstrong]] and [[Clem Hill]]. Rain saved New Zealand from a thrashing in the first match, but not the second, which New Zealand lost by an innings and 358 runs \u2013 currently the second largest defeat in New Zealand first-class history.\n\n===Inter-war period===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1918-19 to 1945}}\nIn 1927 [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927|NZ toured England]]. They played 26 first-class matches, mostly against county sides. They won seven matches, including those against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]. On the strength of the performances of this tour New Zealand was granted [[Test status]].\n\nIn 1929/30 the [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1929\u201330|M.C.C toured NZ]] and played 4 Tests all of 3 days in duration. New Zealand lost its first Test match but drew the next 3. In the second Test [[Stewie Dempster]] and [[John Mills (cricketer, born 1905)|Jackie Mills]] put on 276 for the first wicket. This is still the highest partnership for New Zealand against England. New Zealand first played South Africa in 1931\u201332 in a three match series but were unable to secure Test matches against any teams other than England before [[World War II]] ended all Test cricket for 7 years. A Test tour by Australia, planned for February and March 1940, was cancelled after the outbreak of the war.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Australian cricket team: Tour of New Zealand |journal=Evening Star |date=8 July 1939 |page=32 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ESD19390708.2.186.31 |access-date=29 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329061707/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ESD19390708.2.186.31 |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Bradman may lead Australian team on tour of N.Z. |journal=Auckland Star |date=22 June 1939 |page=23 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19390622.2.179 |access-date=29 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329074455/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19390622.2.179 |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Australian tour abandoned: 'Difficulties caused by war' |journal=Press |date=30 November 1939 |page=12 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19391130.2.86 |access-date=29 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329074508/https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19391130.2.86 |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===After World War II===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 1945-46 to 1970}}\nNew Zealand's first Test after the war was against Australia in 1945/46. This game was not considered a \"Test\" at the time but it was granted Test status retrospectively by the [[International Cricket Council]] in March 1948. The New Zealand players who appeared in this match probably did not appreciate this move by the ICC as New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54. The [[New Zealand Cricket Council]]'s unwillingness to pay Australian players a decent allowance to tour New Zealand ensured that this was the only Test Australia played against New Zealand between 1929 and 1972.\n\nIn 1949 New Zealand sent one of its best ever sides to England. It contained [[Bert Sutcliffe]], [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[John Richard Reid|John R. Reid]] and [[Jack Cowie]]. However, 3-day Test matches ensured that all 4 Tests were drawn. Many have regarded the 1949 tour of England among New Zealand's best ever touring performances. All four tests were high-scoring despite being draws and Martin Donnelly's 206 at Lord's hailed as one of the finest innings ever seen there.<ref name=\"nzhistory.net.nz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/cricket-in-nz/playing-england |title=New Zealand cricket Page 4 \u2013 Playing England |publisher=NZHistory |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207072607/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/cricket-in-nz/playing-england |archive-date=7 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being winless, New Zealand did not lose a test either. Prior to this, only the legendary 1948 Australian team, led by the great [[Don Bradman]], had achieved this.\n\nNew Zealand played its first matches against the West Indies in 1951\u201352, and Pakistan and India in 1955/56.\n\nIn 1954/55 New Zealand recorded the lowest ever innings total, 26 against England. The following season New Zealand achieved its first Test victory. The first 3 Tests of a 4 Test series were won easily by the West Indies but New Zealand won the fourth to notch up its first Test victory. It had taken them 45 matches and 26 years to attain.\n\n{{Test match\n  | date = 9, 10, 12, 13 March 1956\n  | team1 = {{cr-rt|NZL}}\n  | score-team1-inns1 = 255 all out (166.5 overs)\n  | score-team2-inns1 = 145 all out (78.3 overs)\n  | score-team1-inns2 = 157 all out (80 overs)\n  | score-team2-inns2 = 77 all out (45.1 overs)\n  | team2 = {{cr|WIN}}\n  | runs-team1-inns1 = [[John Richard Reid|John R.

NZ's first win over England]]\nIn 1973 [[Richard Hadlee]] debuted and the rate at which New Zealand won Tests picked up dramatically. Hadlee was one of the best pace bowlers of his generation, playing 86 Tests for New Zealand, before he retired in 1990. Of the 86 Tests that Hadlee played in New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. In 1977/78 New Zealand won its first Test against England, at the 48th attempt. Hadlee took 10 wickets in the match.\n\nDuring the 1980s New Zealand also had the services of one of its best ever batsman, [[Martin Crowe]] and a number of good players such as [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]], [[Bruce Edgar]], [[John Fulton Reid|John F. Reid]], [[Andrew Jones (cricketer, born 1959)|Andrew Jones]], [[Geoff Howarth]], [[Jeremy Coney]], [[Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)|Ian Smith]], [[John Bracewell]], [[Lance Cairns]], [[Stephen Boock]], and [[Ewen Chatfield]], who were capable of playing the occasional match winning performance and consistently making a valuable contribution to a Test match.\n\nThe best example of New Zealand's two star players (R. Hadlee and M. Crowe) putting in match winning performances and other players making good contributions is New Zealand versus Australia, 1985 at Brisbane. In Australia's first innings Hadlee took 9\u201352. In New Zealand's only turn at bat, M Crowe scored 188 and John F. Reid 108. Edgar, Wright, Coney, Jeff Crowe, V. Brown, and Hadlee scored between 17 and 54*. In Australia's second innings, Hadlee took 6\u201371 and Chatfield 3\u201375. New Zealand won by an innings and 41 runs.\n\n{{Test match\n| date = 8\u201312 November 1985\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|AUS}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 179 (76.4 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 553/7[[Declaration and forfeiture|d]] (161 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 333 (116.5 overs\n| score-team2-inns2 = \n| team2 = {{cr|NZL}}\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Kepler Wessels]] 70 (186) \n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Richard Hadlee]] 9/52 (23.4 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Martin Crowe]] 188 (328)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Greg Matthews]] 3/110 (31 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Allan Border]] 152* (301)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Richard Hadlee]] 6/71 (28.5 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns2  = \n| wickets-team2-inns2 = \n| result = New Zealand won by an innings and 41 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63415.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[The Gabba]], [[Brisbane]]\n| umpires = [[Tony Crafter]] (Aus) and [[Dick French]] (Aus)\n| motm = [[Richard Hadlee]] (NZ)\n| toss = New Zealand won the toss and elected to field.\n| notes =  \n}}\n\nOne-day cricket also gave New Zealand a chance to compete more regularly than Test cricket with the better sides in world cricket. In one-day cricket a batsman does not need to score centuries to win games for his side and bowlers do not need to bowl the opposition out. One-day games can be won by one batsman getting a 50, a few others getting 30s, bowlers bowling economically and everyone fielding well. These were requirements New Zealand players could consistently meet and thus developed a good one-day record against all sides.\n\nPerhaps New Zealand's most infamous one-day match was the \"under arm\" match against Australia at the [[Melbourne Cricket ground|MCG]] in 1981. Requiring six runs to tie the match off the final ball, Australian captain [[Greg Chappell]] instructed his brother [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]] to \"bowl\" the ball underarm along the wicket to prevent New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie from hitting a six. The Australian umpires ruled the move as legal even though to this day many believe it was one of the most unsporting decisions made in cricket.\n\nWhen New Zealand next played in the tri-series in Australia in 1983, [[Lance Cairns]] became a cult hero for his one-day batting. In one match against Australia, he hit six sixes at the [[Melbourne Cricket ground|MCG]], one of the world's largest grounds. Few fans remember that New Zealand lost this game by 149 runs. However, Lance's greatest contribution to New Zealand cricket was his son [[Chris Cairns]].\n\nChris Cairns made his debut one year before Hadlee retired in 1990. Cairns, one of New Zealand's best all-rounders, led the 1990s bowling attack with [[Danny Morrison (cricketer)|Danny Morrison]]. [[Stephen Fleming]], New Zealand's most prolific scorer, led the batting and the team into the 21st century. [[Nathan Astle]] and [[Craig McMillan]] also scored plenty of runs for New Zealand, but both retired earlier than expected.\n\n[[Daniel Vettori]] made his debut as an 18-year-old in 1997, and when he took over from Fleming as captain in 2007 he was regarded as the best spinning all-rounder in world cricket. On 26 August 2009, Daniel Vettori became the eighth player and second left-arm bowler (after [[Chaminda Vaas]]) in history to take 300 wickets and score 3000 test runs, joining the illustrious club. Vettori decided to take an indefinite break from international short form cricket in 2011 but continued to represent New Zealand in Test cricket and returned for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]].\n\nOn 4 April 1996, New Zealand achieved a unique world record, where the whole team was adjudged Man of the Match for team performance against 4 run victory over the West Indies. This is recorded as the only time where whole team achieved such an award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard_ODI.asp?MatchCode=1153 |title=1995\u20131996 West Indies v New Zealand \u2013 4th Match \u2013 Georgetown, Guyana |publisher=HowStat |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144817/http://howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard_ODI.asp?MatchCode=1153 |archive-date=28 July 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI |title=4th ODI, New Zealand tour of West Indies at Georgetown, Apr 3 1996 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828194336/http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI |archive-date=28 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151262.html | title=Fourth One-Day International \u2013 WEST INDIES v NEW ZEALAND | work=Wisden 1997 | accessdate=2 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405204100/http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151262.html | archive-date=5 April 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{Limited overs international\n  | date = 3 April 1996\n  | team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n  | score1 = 158 (35.5 overs)\n  | score2 = 154 (49.1 overs)\n  | team2 = {{cr|WIN}}\n  | runs1 = [[Craig Spearman]] 41 (39)\n  | wickets1 = [[Laurie Williams (cricketer)|Laurie Williams]] 3/16 (4.5 overs)\n  | runs2 = [[Roland Holder]] 49[[not out|*]] (86)\n  | wickets2 = [[Chris Cairns]] 2/17 (5.1 overs)\n  | result = New Zealand won by 4 runs\n  | report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI Scorecard]\n  | venue = [[Bourda]], [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]\n  | umpires = [[Clyde Duncan (umpire)|Clyde Duncan]] (WI) and [[Eddie Nicholls]] (WI)\n  | motm = New Zealand\n  | toss = West Indies won the toss and elected to field.\n}}\n\n===21st century===\n{{see also|History of cricket in New Zealand from 2000\u201301}}\n[[File:BlackCapsResized.png|thumb|left|The Black Caps logo.]]\nNew Zealand started the new millennium by winning the [[2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy]] in Kenya to claim their first ICC tournament.

When fit, he added a dimension to the NZ bowling attack that had been missing since Hadlee retired.\n\n[[File:New Zealand cricket team, Shoaib Malik, Dunedin, NZ, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The New Zealand team celebrating a dismissal in 2009]]\n\nThe rise of the financial power of the BCCI had an immense effect on NZ cricket and its players. The BCCI managed to convince other boards not to pick players who had joined the rival Twenty-20 [[Indian Cricket League]]. NZ Cricket lost the services of [[Shane Bond]], [[Lou Vincent]], [[Andre Adams]], [[Hamish Marshall]] and [[Daryl Tuffey]]. The money to be made from Twenty-20 cricket in India may have also induced players, such as [[Craig McMillan]] and [[Scott Styris]] (from Test cricket) to retire earlier than they would have otherwise. After the demise of the Indian Cricket League Bond and Tuffey again played for New Zealand.\n\nVettori stood down as Test captain in 2011 leading to star batsman [[Ross Taylor]] to take his place. Taylor led New Zealand for a year which included a thrilling win in a low scoring Test match against Australia in [[Hobart]], their first win over Australia since 1993. In 2012/13 [[Brendon McCullum]] became captain and new players such as [[Kane Williamson]], [[Corey Anderson]], [[Doug Bracewell]], [[Trent Boult]] and [[Jimmy Neesham]] emerged as world-class performers. McCullum captained New Zealand to series wins against the West Indies and India in 2013/14 and both Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2014/15 increasing New Zealand's rankings in both Test and ODI formats. In the series against India McCullum scored 302 at Wellington to become New Zealand's first Test [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple centurion]].\n\nIn early 2015 New Zealand made the final of the Cricket World Cup, going through the tournament undefeated until the final, where they lost to Australia by seven wickets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/results|title=Results {{!}} Cricket World Cup 2015 \u2013 ICC Cricket {{!}} Official Website|website=www.icc-cricket.com|access-date=19 March 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320065120/http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/results|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the New Zealand national cricket team played under the name of [[Aotearoa]] for their first match [[New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2015|against Zimbabwe]] to celebrate [[M\u0101ori Language Week]].<ref name=\"Aotearoa\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-new-zealand-2015/content/story/903551.html |title=New Zealand to play as Aotearoa |accessdate=27 July 2015 |work=ESPNCricinfo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730011806/http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-new-zealand-2015/content/story/903551.html |archive-date=30 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2015 New Zealand toured England,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.cricbuzz.com/cricket-schedule/series/2284/new-zealand-tour-of-england-2015|title=New Zealand tour of England, 2015 schedule \u2013 Match details, time, venue \u2013 Cricbuzz|website=Cricbuzz|access-date=20 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402201714/http://m.cricbuzz.com/cricket-schedule/series/2284/new-zealand-tour-of-england-2015|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> performing well, drawing the Test series 1\u20131, and losing the One Day series, 2\u20133.\n\nFrom October to November 2015, and in February 2016, New Zealand played Australia in two Test Series, in three and two games a piece\n\nWith a changing of an era in the Australian team, New Zealand was rated as a chance of winning especially in New Zealand.
