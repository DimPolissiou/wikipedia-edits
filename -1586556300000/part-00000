He arrived in [[Brisbane]] and was sworn in on 20 November. On 29 June 1906, Chelmsford was invested as a [[Knight Commander of Order of St Michael and St George]].<ref name=Peer/> His term was dominated by conflict between the [[Queensland Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|Legislative Assembly]] and the emergence of three evenly divided parties in the lower house.<ref name=ADB/>\n\nFollowing the [[1907 Queensland state election|1907 election]], [[William Kidston]], who had founded [[Kidstonites|his own party]], became [[Premier of Queensland]] with Labor support.

Chelmsford refused, on the grounds that he did not have a sufficient mandate from the people to make such demands. Kidston resigned in protest and Chelmsford commissioned the [[Leader of the Opposition (Queensland)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Robert Philp]], who formed a ministry, which was promptly defeated in the assembly. Chelmsford then granted Philp a dissolution, though the parliament was only six months old. Because Supply was denied by Kidston, Chelmsford stepped in and used the reserve powers to ensure that supply was passed until the election.<ref name=book/>\n\nKidston was returned to office in the [[1908 Queensland state election|1908 election]]. The new assembly passed a motion criticising Chelmsford's action and there was widespread speculation that he would be recalled. However, nothing came of this. Despite the admission that their representative had been mistaken in granting a dissolution, the [[Colonial Office]] and the British government remained in his favour. Chelmsford's term expired just after Kidston resigned from the Labor Government and formed a coalition with Philp's Conservatives.<ref name=book/>\n\n==Governor of New South Wales==\nIn May 1909 Chelmsford accepted the appointment as [[Governor of New South Wales]] and was sworn in at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] on 28 May 1909. Unlike in Queensland, his term was comparably stable and was distinguished by good relations with the state government. At the start of his term, [[Charles Wade]], of the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]], was the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]]. However, following the 1910 election, Wade's Liberals were defeated and the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] under [[James McGowen]] was sworn in as the state's first Labor Government. Despite his conservative background, Chelmsford was able to get along well with the Labor Government. Chelmsford became friends with the Attorney General, [[William Holman]], with whom they shared a love of music and as a competent Viola player, Chelmsford encouraged chamber concerts at Government House. He said of the government: \"I have never had a body of Ministers with whom it has been a greater pleasure to work. They are quiet, unassuming and industrious, and have won the goodwill and loyalty of their departments.\"<ref>Despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, 28 September 1910, CO 418/80.</ref> From 21 December 1909 to 27 January 1910 Chelmsford acted as Administrator of the Commonwealth when the [[Governor-General of Australia]], [[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|The Earl of Dudley]] was on leave.<ref>{{Citation |title=Governors and Governors-General of Australia |url=http://www.angelfire.com/country/AustralianHistory/govgen.html |accessdate=21 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFrom April to November 1911, Chelmsford was back in England on overseas leave, thereby avoiding a major political crisis in New South Wales. In July 1911, two Labor Members of the Legislative Assembly resigned in protest over land reforms, thereby leaving McGowen's government in a minority in the assembly. Holman, who had stepped in as acting-Premier following McGowen also taking leave (Both Chelmsford and McGowen were attending the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]), asked the [[Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales]], [[William Portus Cullen|Sir William Cullen]], to prorogue the Parliament until the by-elections were held. Cullen declined on the basis that there was no need for him to act as the Government still had the confidence of the House and that the Governor had no discretion in the matter. Holman rejected this and, when Parliament resumed, resigned along with his Ministry and the Speaker. Holman further refused to advise Cullen to ask the [[Leader of the Opposition (New South Wales)|Leader of the Opposition]], Wade, to form a Government. Cullen did so nonetheless. Wade was wary, aware that if he accepted he too would be in a minority. Wade told Cullen that he would only accept if he was granted a dissolution. Cullen did not accept that condition and Wade refused to accept the commission. Cullen then had no choice but to recommission Holman and grant him a dissolution. Holman held onto Government tenuously as one seat was lost the by-elections. He therefore asked a member of the Opposition Liberals, [[Henry Willis (Australian politician)|Henry Willis]], to take the Chair as Speaker.<ref name=book/> \n[[File:Governor and Lady Chelmsford.jpg|thumb|Governor and Lady Chelmsford in 1910.]]\nDespite the crisis having been averted, Chelmsford returned to face increasing problems over the balance of power in the appointed [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. The Council had only five Labor members in a total of 73 and as a result, 70% of house divisions were lost by the government in its first three years in office, despite a recognised need for cooperation. Chelmsford therefore approved 11 appointments in 1912, leaving Labor with only 13 members out of 59. McGowen was under pressure to ask for more appointments to move for the abolition of the Council, but he had no such intention of doing so. In October 1912, Chelmsford announced his intention not to seek a further term as governor, which the Colonial Office reluctantly accepted, describing him as \"careful, hardworking and popular\".<ref name=book/> A Freemason, in 1910 he was elected the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of NSW and held the position until 1913. In 1909 Freemason Lodge Chelmsford 261 was established in New South Wales in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Of Lodge Chelmsford 261| publisher=Lodge Chelmsford No 261|url=http://www.lodgechelmsford.com/about-us.html|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> In 1912 he was invested as a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]], becoming Chancellor of the Order from 1914 to 1916.<ref name=Peer/> His term expired and Chelmsford returned to England in March 1913.<ref name=ADB/>\n\n==Viceroy of India==\nUpon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he rejoined his regiment and was posted to India.

Together they oversaw the implementation of the [[Montagu-Chelmsford reforms]], which gave greater authority to local Indian representative bodies and paved the way for a free India. Trying to tread a fine line between reform and maintaining the British hold over India, Chelmsford passed repressive anti-terrorism laws to widespread opposition from Indian reformists. The laws sparked unrest in the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], culminating in the implementation of martial law in the region and the [[Amritsar Massacre]] by General [[Reginald Dyer]] on 13 April 1919. Initially supportive of Dyer and slow to respond to the massacre, following a ruling condemning Dyer's actions, Chelmsford eventually disciplined Dyer. This was however, seen by Indian Nationalists as too little, too late and the [[Indian National Congress]] boycotted the first regional elections in 1920. In addition to this, the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] broke out and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] started his first campaign. On his return to Britain on 15 June 1921, he was elevated to Viscount as 1st '''Viscount Chelmsford''' of Chelmsford, County of Essex.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 32360|page=4823|date= 15 June 1921}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and legacy==\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 205340 Viscount Chelmsford, ca.1924.jpg|thumb|150px|Chelmsford as First Lord of the Admiralty.]]\nIn 1924, despite being a lifelong [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], Chelmsford was persuaded to join the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924 as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]], due to the fact that Labour had so few peers in the [[House of Lords]].

He arrived in [[Brisbane]] and was sworn in on 20 November. On 29 June 1906, Chelmsford was invested as a [[Knight Commander of Order of St Michael and St George]].<ref name=Peer/> His term was dominated by conflict between the [[Queensland Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|Legislative Assembly]] and the emergence of three evenly divided parties in the lower house.<ref name=ADB/>\n\nFollowing the [[1907 Queensland state election|1907 election]], [[William Kidston]], who had founded [[Kidstonites|his own party]], became [[Premier of Queensland]] with Labor support.

Chelmsford refused, on the grounds that he did not have a sufficient mandate from the people to make such demands. Kidston resigned in protest and Chelmsford commissioned the [[Leader of the Opposition (Queensland)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Robert Philp]], who formed a ministry, which was promptly defeated in the assembly. Chelmsford then granted Philp a dissolution, though the parliament was only six months old. Because Supply was denied by Kidston, Chelmsford stepped in and used the reserve powers to ensure that supply was passed until the election.<ref name=book/>\n\nKidston was returned to office in the [[1908 Queensland state election|1908 election]]. The new assembly passed a motion criticising Chelmsford's action and there was widespread speculation that he would be recalled. However, nothing came of this. Despite the admission that their representative had been mistaken in granting a dissolution, the [[Colonial Office]] and the British government remained in his favour. Chelmsford's term expired just after Kidston resigned from the Labor Government and formed a coalition with Philp's Conservatives.<ref name=book/>\n\n==Governor of New South Wales==\nIn May 1909 Chelmsford accepted the appointment as [[Governor of New South Wales]] and was sworn in at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] on 28 May 1909. Unlike in Queensland, his term was comparably stable and was distinguished by good relations with the state government. At the start of his term, [[Charles Wade]], of the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]], was the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]]. However, following the 1910 election, Wade's Liberals were defeated and the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] under [[James McGowen]] was sworn in as the state's first Labor Government. Despite his conservative background, Chelmsford was able to get along well with the Labor Government. Chelmsford became friends with the Attorney General, [[William Holman]], with whom they shared a love of music and as a competent Viola player, Chelmsford encouraged chamber concerts at Government House. He said of the government: \"I have never had a body of Ministers with whom it has been a greater pleasure to work. They are quiet, unassuming and industrious, and have won the goodwill and loyalty of their departments.\"<ref>Despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, 28 September 1910, CO 418/80.</ref> From 21 December 1909 to 27 January 1910 Chelmsford acted as Administrator of the Commonwealth when the [[Governor-General of Australia]], [[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|The Earl of Dudley]] was on leave.<ref>{{Citation |title=Governors and Governors-General of Australia |url=http://www.angelfire.com/country/AustralianHistory/govgen.html |accessdate=21 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFrom April to November 1911, Chelmsford was back in England on overseas leave, thereby avoiding a major political crisis in New South Wales. In July 1911, two Labor Members of the Legislative Assembly resigned in protest over land reforms, thereby leaving McGowen's government in a minority in the assembly. Holman, who had stepped in as acting-Premier following McGowen also taking leave (Both Chelmsford and McGowen were attending the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]), asked the [[Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales]], [[William Portus Cullen|Sir William Cullen]], to prorogue the Parliament until the by-elections were held. Cullen declined on the basis that there was no need for him to act as the Government still had the confidence of the House and that the Governor had no discretion in the matter. Holman rejected this and, when Parliament resumed, resigned along with his Ministry and the Speaker. Holman further refused to advise Cullen to ask the [[Leader of the Opposition (New South Wales)|Leader of the Opposition]], Wade, to form a Government. Cullen did so nonetheless. Wade was wary, aware that if he accepted he too would be in a minority. Wade told Cullen that he would only accept if he was granted a dissolution. Cullen did not accept that condition and Wade refused to accept the commission. Cullen then had no choice but to recommission Holman and grant him a dissolution. Holman held onto Government tenuously as one seat was lost the by-elections. He therefore asked a member of the Opposition Liberals, [[Henry Willis (Australian politician)|Henry Willis]], to take the Chair as Speaker.<ref name=book/> \n[[File:Governor and Lady Chelmsford.jpg|thumb|Governor and Lady Chelmsford in 1910.]]\nDespite the crisis having been averted, Chelmsford returned to face increasing problems over the balance of power in the appointed [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. The Council had only five Labor members in a total of 73 and as a result, 70% of house divisions were lost by the government in its first three years in office, despite a recognised need for cooperation. Chelmsford therefore approved 11 appointments in 1912, leaving Labor with only 13 members out of 59. McGowen was under pressure to ask for more appointments to move for the abolition of the Council, but he had no such intention of doing so. In October 1912, Chelmsford announced his intention not to seek a further term as governor, which the Colonial Office reluctantly accepted, describing him as \"careful, hardworking and popular\".<ref name=book/> A Freemason, in 1910 he was elected the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of NSW and held the position until 1913. In 1909 Freemason Lodge Chelmsford 261 was established in New South Wales in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Of Lodge Chelmsford 261| publisher=Lodge Chelmsford No 261|url=http://www.lodgechelmsford.com/about-us.html|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref> In 1912 he was invested as a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]], becoming Chancellor of the Order from 1914 to 1916.<ref name=Peer/> His term expired and Chelmsford returned to England in March 1913.<ref name=ADB/>\n\n==Viceroy of India==\nUpon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he rejoined his regiment and was posted to India. On 29 February 1916 he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] (PC).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 29492|page=2207|date= 29 February 1916}}</ref> Rising quickly, he was appointed Viceroy in March 1916, succeeding [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29502|page=2578|date=3 March 1916}}</ref> As Viceroy he was invested as [[Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire]] and a [[Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India]] in 1916 and was also Grand Master of the orders.<ref name=Peer/> He was invested as a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] on 4 December 1917.<ref name=GBE>{{London Gazette|issue= 30413|page=12680|date=4 December 1917}}</ref>\n\nHis time as Viceroy was marked with consistent calls for self-government, which Chelmsford agreed to, convincing a preoccupied Foreign Office to send the [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]], to discuss the potential for reform. Together they oversaw the implementation of the [[Montagu-Chelmsford reforms]], which gave greater authority to local Indian representative bodies and paved the way for a free India. Trying to tread a fine line between reform and maintaining the British hold over India, Chelmsford passed repressive anti-terrorism laws to widespread opposition from Indian reformists. The laws sparked unrest in the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], culminating in the implementation of martial law in the region and the [[Amritsar Massacre]] by General [[Reginald Dyer]] on 13 April 1919. Initially supportive of Dyer and slow to respond to the massacre, following a ruling condemning Dyer's actions, Chelmsford eventually disciplined Dyer. This was however, seen by Indian Nationalists as too little, too late and the [[Indian National Congress]] boycotted the first regional elections in 1920. In addition to this, the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] broke out and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] started his first campaign. On his return to Britain on 15 June 1921, he was elevated to Viscount as 1st '''Viscount Chelmsford''' of Chelmsford, County of Essex.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 32360|page=4823|date= 15 June 1921}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and legacy==\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 205340 Viscount Chelmsford, ca.1924.jpg|thumb|150px|Chelmsford as First Lord of the Admiralty.]]\nIn 1924, despite being a lifelong [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], Chelmsford was persuaded to join the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924 as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]], due to the fact that Labour had so few peers in the [[House of Lords]]. He never joined the party and only agreed on the condition that the Navy's size be maintained and that he not be expected to attend any cabinet meetings of a political nature.

The reasoning for this was that during state Attorney-General [[Edward McTiernan]]'s visit to London to put the Government's case over its disputes with Governor [[Dudley de Chair]]'s opposition over the abolition of the Legislative Council the Government needed an influential representative in London and Labor Premier, [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], explained that \"it was absolutely necessary that the State should be represented by a gentleman who would be in close touch with the London financial market\".<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'', 16 June 1926</ref> He served until 1928.<ref name=ADB/>\n\nHe was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Law by [[Birmingham University]] in 1927, an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law by Magdalen College, Oxford University in 1929 and as a [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Knight of Justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem]].<ref name=Peer/> As a [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellow]] of All Souls, Chelmsford became [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of the College in 1932.<ref name=\"vch\">{{cite book|editor1=Salter, H.

Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The beginnings (1986\u20131997) ===\n\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled ''Opportunities in Chemistry''. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n=== The early years (1997\u20132001) ===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|frame|left|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities. This science is driving technology development and computational capabilities.\n\n== EMSL directors ==\n*Thom Dunning \u2014 led construction activities, 1994\u20131997\n*Teresa Fryberger \u2014 interim director, 1997\u20131998\n*Jean Futrell \u2014 1999\u20132002\n*J.W.
