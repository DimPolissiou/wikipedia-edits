The original series aired from October 6, 2004 until October 26, 2016 on [[Syfy]]. The original program spanned [[List of Ghost Hunters episodes|eleven seasons with 230 episodes, not including 10 specials.]] The series was [[revival (television)|revived]] in early 2019 and aired its twelfth season of 11 episodes, not including 2 specials, from August 21, 2019 to October 30, 2019 on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]. A thirteenth season is set to premiere on April 8, 2020.\n\nThe program featured [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], who founded ''[[The Atlantic Paranormal Society|The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS)]]'' team of [[Ghost hunting|paranormal investigators]] to investigate places that are reported to be [[ghosts|haunted]]. The two worked as [[plumbers]] for [[Roto-Rooter]] while moonlighting as paranormal investigators at night. As of the twelfth season, the revived show features Grant and a new investigatory team that has no discernible connection to ''TAPS'', although the series still maintains the same format and producers and frequently references past episodes.\n\nThe series, initially produced for 10 episodes as a [[docu-soap]], had later episodes shift to a more [[documentary]] focus. '' Ghost Hunters'' episodes feature the team going to [[List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States|reportedly haunted locations]] across the [[United States]], with some investigations in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]] in earlier seasons. The latter concept led to the show's first [[spin-off (television)|spin-off]], ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'' in 2008, which often featured ''Ghost Hunters'' investigators in lead and guest roles, including Hawes and Wilson. A second spin-off, ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'' (2009\u201310), had ''TAPS'' members Dave Tango and Steve Gonsalves training prospective investigators in a competitive format. Additionally, annual Halloween specials were broadcast [[live television|live]] from 2005 to 2011 and featured celebrity guests and interactivity. \n\nThe series popularized [[paranormal television|paranormal reality television]] and [[ghost hunting]] and some members of the show have moved on to feature in their own television programs.\n\n== Premise ==\n\n[[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], along with other team members who belong to the group they founded, [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS), investigate locations of interest by using various electronic equipment, which they believe is capable of detecting [[paranormal]] activity. The two originally worked as [[plumber]]s for [[Roto-Rooter]] as a day job while investigating locations at night.<ref>{{cite web |title=When ghosts attack - CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/10/31/boo/index.html |website=www.cnn.com |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Investigative procedures ===\n{{moresources|section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen investigating a location, TAPS team members first visit and survey the property with its owners, who describe their experiences at the site. Next, the team sets up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hotspots. The TAPS team then spends several hours taking [[electromagnetic field]] and temperature readings, recording audio for [[electronic voice phenomena|EVPs]], and filming with digital video cameras. Many times, they will even try to verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, the team spends several days analyzing all of the data for evidence of possible paranormal activity.\n\nA few days after reviewing the information, Hawes and Wilson discuss their findings with the location site owners, offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions the owners may have.\n\nThe TAPS members state that they do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal and sometimes provide reasonable explanations such as [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]]s which may be drafty windows, strange noises that may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, moving objects which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged, or phantom lights which can be reflections of light from a passing vehicle.\n\nSince the series began airing, TAPS has recorded thousands of hours of audio and video data. Most investigations, according to TAPS, turn up cold with very little, if any, paranormal activity occurring; however, the ghost hunters claim to have several decent recordings of [[poltergeist|moving objects]], mysterious [[will-o'-the-wisp|lights]], strange mists, and [[shadow people|shadowy figures]] that manifest before the camera and are highlighted at the end of the show.\n\n[[Syfy|Sci Fi]] initially categorized the program as a [[docu-soap]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Breaking News - NBC Goes Sci Fi with First-Time Network Broadcasts of Hit Sci Fi Channel Reality Series 'Scare Tactics' and 'Ghost Hunters' on October 30 {{!}} TheFutonCritic.com |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/10/26/nbc-goes-sci-fi-with-first-time-network-broadcasts-of-hit-sci-fi-channel-reality-series-scare-tactics-and-ghost-hunters-on-october-30-17146/20041026nbc01/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> In addition to the investigative aspect, the show has also presented personal conflicts and relationships among members of the TAPS team. Portions of some episodes portray Hawes and Wilson involved with their plumbing job or personal lives, but this varies by episode and is not always included. As the series progressed, however, the \"behind-the-scenes\" and \"docu-soap\" aspects have been reduced, and the fifth season has so far focused primarily on the investigations, with virtually none of the docu-soap material that characterized earlier episodes.\n\n=== Equipment used ===\n\nDuring investigations, the TAPS ghost hunters team use various equipment, including digital [[thermometer]]s, [[EMF meter]]s, [[thermographic camera|thermographic]] and [[night vision]] cameras, handheld and static [[digital camera|digital]] [[video camera]]s, digital [[dictation machine|audio recorders]], and [[laptop]] computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maggwire.com/ghost-hunting-equipment/|title=\"Ghost Hunting Equipment: Tools To Get Rid Of Demons by Amy Bruni\" Maggwire.com|publisher=Maggwire|last=Tung|first=Christen|date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe team has also experimented, in at least one episode, with a [[geiger counter]] during their investigation to see if it would register any anomalous readings.\n\nStarting around the third season, the team has used the K-2 (or K-II) meter,<ref>{{YouTube|ArzVZ11yXsQ|K-II meter modification demo}}</ref> a type of EMF meter that uses a series of [[LED]]s to [[EMF measurements|measure]] the strength of an energy field instead of a numerical [[LCD]] screen. During the Manson murders investigation, in particular, the team used a K-2 meter in an attempt to get \"yes\" and \"no\" responses to verbal questions posed to a supposed entity in a room.\n\nIn the fifth season's \"Edith Wharton Estate\" case, the team introduced two new pieces of equipment. One is a custom-made [[geophone]], which detects vibrations and flashes a series of LEDs that measure the intensity of the vibration. The second is a new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]], and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes. In the episode, the geophones were recorded on video flashing to the vibrations of what sounds like footsteps across a floor even though no one was supposedly in the room.\n\nOther gear not typically shown on screen are an [[ion]] generator, a device that charges the air with electricity and is theorized to help spirits manifest, and the [[white noise machine|white noise generator]], an audio device that makes a static [[background noise]] and is theorized to act as a catalyst for assisting entities in making [[electronic voice phenomenon|EVPs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/GhostHunters|title=\"Steve's Gear Guide\" Video Blog on SciFi.com|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Investigators ==\n{{inc-video}}\n* [[Grant Wilson]] - lead investigator/producer/TAPS co-founder (2004\u20132012; 2014 guest; 2019\u2013present)\n* [[Ghost Mine (TV series)|Kristen Luman]] - guest investigator (2015); co-lead investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Daryl Marston - co-lead investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Mustafa Gatollari - research historian/investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Brandon Alvis - tech manager/investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Brian Murray - investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Richel Stratton - investigator (2019\u2013)\n\n=== Former ===\nThis list includes former investigators considered part of the crew, and is sorted by tenure and amount of investigations taken part in. \n{{columns\n|col1=\n* [[Jason Hawes]] \u2013 lead investigator/producer/TAPS Founder (2004\u20132016)\n* Steve Gonsalves \u2013 co-lead investigator, previously tech manager (2004\u20132016)\n* Dave Tango \u2013 tech manager/investigator (2005\u20132016)\n* [[Kindred Spirits (TV series)|Amy Bruni]] \u2013 investigator (2008\u20132014)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=\u2018Ghost Hunters\u2019 Co-Stars Amy Bruni & Adam Berry To Depart, Develop Paranormal Series |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/ghost-hunters-co-stars-amy-bruni-adam-berry-to-depart-develop-paranormal-series/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=23 November 2019 |language=en |date=29 May 2014}}</ref>\n* Britt Griffith \u2013 investigator (2008\u20132014)\n* Kris Williams \u2013 case manager/investigator (2007\u20132011; moved to ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'')\n* K.J.

It has since been syndicated on [[NBC Universal]] sister cable channel [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] and also airs on the Canadian cable network, [[Outdoor Life Network|OLN]].\n\nIn the early shows, TAPS was headquartered in a trailer located behind Jason Hawes' house, and they drove one white van to investigations. Within one season, they had moved the entire operation to a storefront in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], and acquired several new TAPS vehicles.\n\nIn addition to their successful television venture, TAPS operates a website where they share their stories, photographs, and [[ghost hunting]] videos with an ever-growing membership list. Because of the popularity of the show, TAPS cast members have signed contracts with at least two talent agencies, Escape Artistry and GP Entertainment, to manage their appearances at lectures, conferences and public events.\n\nIn addition to the success of the series, TAPS has ventured into the venue of radio broadcast, hosting a three-hour weekly show called ''Beyond Reality''. New episodes are broadcast every Saturday from 7 pm to 10 pm [[Eastern Time]], though sometimes may skip a week due to the possibility of the hosts being busy with other ventures. The radio show covers topics in a vast array of areas such as [[cryptozoology]], [[spiritualism]], [[ufology]], and [[ghost]]s. The show is hosted by Grant Wilson and Jason Hawes, and includes guest appearances from other TAPS members and special guests such as [[John Zaffis]], Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Chris Fleming, and others who specialize in certain fields. Noted paranormal author Jeff Belanger and ''Spooky Southcoast'' radio host and author Tim Weisberg served as fill-in hosts for Jason and Grant. The show also once simulcasted on ''Spooky Southcoast'', airing from the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, ''Ghost Hunters''' 100th episode aired featuring their investigation of [[Alcatraz]] Prison. The two-hour special featured a live studio audience with question and answer segments, hosted by [[Josh Gates]] of ''[[Destination Truth]]''. The special also featured the ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'' crew, the winning contestants of ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'', and Craig Piligian, the creator and executive producer of ''Ghost Hunters''. On June 2, 2011, Syfy renewed ''Ghost Hunters'' for an eighth season, marking it as the longest-running reality series to air on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy/|title=\"Ghost Hunters\" Renewed For Season 8 By Syfy|accessdate=October 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427135411/http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Hawes announced that ''Ghost Hunters'' would be concluding on Syfy with season 11 being the last season to be produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jason-hawestaps/ghost-hunters-leaving-syfy/10153794588723212|title=Ghost Hunters leaving Syfy!|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2019, it was announced that the series would be [[revival (television)|revived]] later that year with Wilson returning with a new team.

Another occurs when a supposed disembodied voice tells the hunters, \"You're not supposed to be here.\" Critics{{who|date=November 2019}} have claimed the voice sounded like it was piped in from an external audio source. In regard to the scrutiny, Wilson and Hawes defended themselves, stating that everything in the show is real.<ref name=\"cliqueC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cliqueclack.com/tv/2008/11/14/was-the-coat-pull-on-ghost-hunters-live-event-faked/|title=Archived copy|accessdate=April 7, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421123443/http://www.cliqueclack.com/tv/2008/11/14/was-the-coat-pull-on-ghost-hunters-live-event-faked/|archivedate=April 21, 2009}} TAPS Interview</ref> In a 2013 interview on ''The Reveal,'' Wilson stated that their television contracts forbade them from faking evidence on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thereveal.podomatic.com/entry/2013-01-26T10_40_52-08_00|title=Grant Wilson 75 minute long Interview Jan 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, Steve Gonsalves from ''Ghost Hunters'' along with Chris Smith and Mike Goncalves of the TV show Haunted Towns hosted a \u201cDeath Ship Ghost Hunt\u201d as part of Ghost Hunt Weekends on the USS North Carolina. Paranormal researcher Kenny Biddle wrote an article for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' addressing the criticism this event received stating that it could tarnish the reputation of this historical site.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biddle |first1=Kenny |title=Celebrity Ghost Hunts At Historical Locations |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/celebrity_ghost_hunts_at_historical_locations/?/specialarticles/show/celebrity_ghost_hunts_at_historical_locations |website=skepticalinquirer.org |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |accessdate=March 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Method ====\n\nAccording to investigator Benjamin Radford, most ghost hunting groups including TAPS make many methodological mistakes. \"After watching episodes of ''Ghost Hunters'' and other similar programs, it quickly becomes clear to anyone with a background in science that the methods used are both illogical and unscientific\". Anyone can be a ghost investigator, \"failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena\", considering emotions and feelings as \"evidence of ghostly encounters.\" \"Improper and unscientific investigation methods\", for example, \"using unproven tools and equipment\", \"sampling errors\", \"ineffectively using recording devices\" and \"focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena.\" In an article for ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation: \"I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously. Most of the efforts to investigate ghosts so far have been badly flawed and unscientific \u2014 and not surprisingly, fruitless.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |date=November\u2013December 2010 |title=Ghost-Hunting Mistakes: Science and Pseudoscience in Ghost Investigations |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=44\u201346}}</ref> In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article about ''Ghost Hunters'' and TAPS, Radford contended that \"the group and others like it lack scientific rigor and mislead people into thinking that their homes are haunted.\"<ref name='NYT'>{{cite news|first=BRIAN|last=STELTER|title=\u2018Ghost Hunters\u2019 Seeks Spirits and Ratings|date=November 10, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/arts/television/11ghost.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=ghost%20hunters&st=cse|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 4, 2012|quote=Benjamin Radford, the managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, says the group and others like it lack scientific rigor and mislead people into thinking that their homes are haunted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand some of the damage that the show can do to fragile people who are scared and looking for a real explanation to their experiences,\u201d said Mr. Radford, who also investigates ghostly claims.}}</ref>\n\nThe show's editing has been questioned, such as activity that is not captured on tape and findings that are unsupported by evidence in the show specifically. Tools are used in ways that are not proven effective, or in ways in which they have been proven ineffective, such as [[IR thermometer|infrared thermometers]] that are claimed to detect cold spots in the middle of rooms when such tools are able only to measure the surface temperature of objects.<ref name=\"eSkeptic\"/>\n\nTechniques with thermal imaging cameras, [[Geiger counters]], [[electronic voice phenomenon]], and [[Electromagnetic fluctuation|EMF]] detectors are used with little or no explanation as to how the techniques have proven to provide evidence of ghosts or other entities. There are concerns that the devices are misused, such as the noting of Benjamin Radford's article for ''Skeptical Inquirer'': \"you may own the world's most sophisticated thermometer, but if you are using it as a barometer, your measurements are worthless.

The original series aired from October 6, 2004 until October 26, 2016 on [[Syfy]]. The original program spanned [[List of Ghost Hunters episodes|eleven seasons with 230 episodes, not including 10 specials.]] The series was [[revival (television)|revived]] in early 2019 and aired its twelfth season of 11 episodes, not including 2 specials, from August 21, 2019 to October 30, 2019 on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]. A thirteenth season is set to premiere on April 8, 2020.\n\nThe program featured [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], who founded ''[[The Atlantic Paranormal Society|The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS)]]'' team of [[Ghost hunting|paranormal investigators]] to investigate places that are reported to be [[ghosts|haunted]]. The two worked as [[plumbers]] for [[Roto-Rooter]] while moonlighting as paranormal investigators at night. As of the twelfth season, the revived show features Grant and a new investigatory team that has no discernible connection to ''TAPS'', although the series still maintains the same format and producers and frequently references past episodes.\n\nThe series, initially produced for 10 episodes as a [[docu-soap]], had later episodes shift to a more [[documentary]] focus. '' Ghost Hunters'' episodes feature the team going to [[List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States|reportedly haunted locations]] across the [[United States]], with some investigations in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]] in earlier seasons. The latter concept led to the show's first [[spin-off (television)|spin-off]], ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'' in 2008, which often featured ''Ghost Hunters'' investigators in lead and guest roles, including Hawes and Wilson. A second spin-off, ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'' (2009\u201310), had ''TAPS'' members Dave Tango and Steve Gonsalves training prospective investigators in a competitive format. Additionally, annual Halloween specials were broadcast [[live television|live]] from 2005 to 2011 and featured celebrity guests and interactivity. \n\nThe series popularized [[paranormal television|paranormal reality television]] and [[ghost hunting]] and some members of the show have moved on to feature in their own television programs.\n\n== Premise ==\n\n[[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], along with other team members who belong to the group they founded, [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS), investigate locations of interest by using various electronic equipment, which they believe is capable of detecting [[paranormal]] activity. The two originally worked as [[plumber]]s for [[Roto-Rooter]] as a day job while investigating locations at night.<ref>{{cite web |title=When ghosts attack - CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/10/31/boo/index.html |website=www.cnn.com |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Investigative procedures ===\n{{moresources|section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen investigating a location, TAPS team members first visit and survey the property with its owners, who describe their experiences at the site. Next, the team sets up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hotspots. The TAPS team then spends several hours taking [[electromagnetic field]] and temperature readings, recording audio for [[electronic voice phenomena|EVPs]], and filming with digital video cameras. Many times, they will even try to verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, the team spends several days analyzing all of the data for evidence of possible paranormal activity.\n\nA few days after reviewing the information, Hawes and Wilson discuss their findings with the location site owners, offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions the owners may have.\n\nThe TAPS members state that they do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal and sometimes provide reasonable explanations such as [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]]s which may be drafty windows, strange noises that may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, moving objects which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged, or phantom lights which can be reflections of light from a passing vehicle.\n\nSince the series began airing, TAPS has recorded thousands of hours of audio and video data. Most investigations, according to TAPS, turn up cold with very little, if any, paranormal activity occurring; however, the ghost hunters claim to have several decent recordings of [[poltergeist|moving objects]], mysterious [[will-o'-the-wisp|lights]], strange mists, and [[shadow people|shadowy figures]] that manifest before the camera and are highlighted at the end of the show.\n\n[[Syfy|Sci Fi]] initially categorized the program as a [[docu-soap]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Breaking News - NBC Goes Sci Fi with First-Time Network Broadcasts of Hit Sci Fi Channel Reality Series 'Scare Tactics' and 'Ghost Hunters' on October 30 {{!}} TheFutonCritic.com |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/10/26/nbc-goes-sci-fi-with-first-time-network-broadcasts-of-hit-sci-fi-channel-reality-series-scare-tactics-and-ghost-hunters-on-october-30-17146/20041026nbc01/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> In addition to the investigative aspect, the show has also presented personal conflicts and relationships among members of the TAPS team. Portions of some episodes portray Hawes and Wilson involved with their plumbing job or personal lives, but this varies by episode and is not always included. As the series progressed, however, the \"behind-the-scenes\" and \"docu-soap\" aspects have been reduced, and the fifth season has so far focused primarily on the investigations, with virtually none of the docu-soap material that characterized earlier episodes.\n\n=== Equipment used ===\n\nDuring investigations, the TAPS ghost hunters team use various equipment, including digital [[thermometer]]s, [[EMF meter]]s, [[thermographic camera|thermographic]] and [[night vision]] cameras, handheld and static [[digital camera|digital]] [[video camera]]s, digital [[dictation machine|audio recorders]], and [[laptop]] computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maggwire.com/ghost-hunting-equipment/|title=\"Ghost Hunting Equipment: Tools To Get Rid Of Demons by Amy Bruni\" Maggwire.com|publisher=Maggwire|last=Tung|first=Christen|date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe team has also experimented, in at least one episode, with a [[geiger counter]] during their investigation to see if it would register any anomalous readings.\n\nStarting around the third season, the team has used the K-2 (or K-II) meter,<ref>{{YouTube|ArzVZ11yXsQ|K-II meter modification demo}}</ref> a type of EMF meter that uses a series of [[LED]]s to [[EMF measurements|measure]] the strength of an energy field instead of a numerical [[LCD]] screen. During the Manson murders investigation, in particular, the team used a K-2 meter in an attempt to get \"yes\" and \"no\" responses to verbal questions posed to a supposed entity in a room.\n\nIn the fifth season's \"Edith Wharton Estate\" case, the team introduced two new pieces of equipment. One is a custom-made [[geophone]], which detects vibrations and flashes a series of LEDs that measure the intensity of the vibration. The second is a new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]], and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes. In the episode, the geophones were recorded on video flashing to the vibrations of what sounds like footsteps across a floor even though no one was supposedly in the room.\n\nOther gear not typically shown on screen are an [[ion]] generator, a device that charges the air with electricity and is theorized to help spirits manifest, and the [[white noise machine|white noise generator]], an audio device that makes a static [[background noise]] and is theorized to act as a catalyst for assisting entities in making [[electronic voice phenomenon|EVPs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/GhostHunters|title=\"Steve's Gear Guide\" Video Blog on SciFi.com|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Investigators ==\n{{inc-video}}\n* [[Grant Wilson]] - lead investigator/producer/TAPS co-founder (2004\u20132012; 2014 guest; 2019\u2013present)\n* [[Ghost Mine (TV series)|Kristen Luman]] - guest investigator (2015); co-lead investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Daryl Marston - co-lead investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Mustafa Gatollari - research historian/investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Brandon Alvis - tech manager/investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Brian Murray - investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Richel Stratton - investigator (2019\u2013)\n\n=== Former ===\nThis list includes former investigators considered part of the crew, and is sorted by tenure and amount of investigations taken part in. \n{{columns\n|col1=\n* [[Jason Hawes]] \u2013 lead investigator/producer/TAPS Founder (2004\u20132016)\n* Steve Gonsalves \u2013 co-lead investigator, previously tech manager (2004\u20132016)\n* Dave Tango \u2013 tech manager/investigator (2005\u20132016)\n* [[Kindred Spirits (TV series)|Amy Bruni]] \u2013 investigator (2008\u20132014)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=\u2018Ghost Hunters\u2019 Co-Stars Amy Bruni & Adam Berry To Depart, Develop Paranormal Series |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/ghost-hunters-co-stars-amy-bruni-adam-berry-to-depart-develop-paranormal-series/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=23 November 2019 |language=en |date=29 May 2014}}</ref>\n* Britt Griffith \u2013 investigator (2008\u20132014)\n* Kris Williams \u2013 case manager/investigator (2007\u20132011; moved to ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'')\n* K.J.

It has since been syndicated on [[NBC Universal]] sister cable channel [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] and also airs on the Canadian cable network, [[Outdoor Life Network|OLN]].\n\nIn the early shows, TAPS was headquartered in a trailer located behind Jason Hawes' house, and they drove one white van to investigations. Within one season, they had moved the entire operation to a storefront in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], and acquired several new TAPS vehicles.\n\nIn addition to their successful television venture, TAPS operates a website where they share their stories, photographs, and [[ghost hunting]] videos with an ever-growing membership list. Because of the popularity of the show, TAPS cast members have signed contracts with at least two talent agencies, Escape Artistry and GP Entertainment, to manage their appearances at lectures, conferences and public events.\n\nIn addition to the success of the series, TAPS has ventured into the venue of radio broadcast, hosting a three-hour weekly show called ''Beyond Reality''. New episodes are broadcast every Saturday from 7 pm to 10 pm [[Eastern Time]], though sometimes may skip a week due to the possibility of the hosts being busy with other ventures. The radio show covers topics in a vast array of areas such as [[cryptozoology]], [[spiritualism]], [[ufology]], and [[ghost]]s. The show is hosted by Grant Wilson and Jason Hawes, and includes guest appearances from other TAPS members and special guests such as [[John Zaffis]], Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Chris Fleming, and others who specialize in certain fields. Noted paranormal author Jeff Belanger and ''Spooky Southcoast'' radio host and author Tim Weisberg served as fill-in hosts for Jason and Grant. The show also once simulcasted on ''Spooky Southcoast'', airing from the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, ''Ghost Hunters''' 100th episode aired featuring their investigation of [[Alcatraz]] Prison. The two-hour special featured a live studio audience with question and answer segments, hosted by [[Josh Gates]] of ''[[Destination Truth]]''. The special also featured the ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'' crew, the winning contestants of ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'', and Craig Piligian, the creator and executive producer of ''Ghost Hunters''. On June 2, 2011, Syfy renewed ''Ghost Hunters'' for an eighth season, marking it as the longest-running reality series to air on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy/|title=\"Ghost Hunters\" Renewed For Season 8 By Syfy|accessdate=October 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427135411/http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Hawes announced that ''Ghost Hunters'' would be concluding on Syfy with season 11 being the last season to be produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jason-hawestaps/ghost-hunters-leaving-syfy/10153794588723212|title=Ghost Hunters leaving Syfy!|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2019, it was announced that the series would be [[revival (television)|revived]] later that year with Wilson returning with a new team.

Anyone can be a ghost investigator, \"failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena\", considering emotions and feelings as \"evidence of ghostly encounters.\" \"Improper and unscientific investigation methods\", for example, \"using unproven tools and equipment\", \"sampling errors\", \"ineffectively using recording devices\" and \"focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena.\" In an article for ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation: \"I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously.

He was the first Indonesian governor of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], serving between 1950 and 1955, and was an early proponent of Moluccan inclusion in the Indonesian state.\n\nLatuharhary was born in [[Saparua]] and moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to pursue higher education, before receiving a scholarship to study at [[Leiden University]]. Upon his return, he worked as a judge in [[East Java]] and began participating in the Indonesian nationalist movement through the Ambonese diaspora association ''Sarekat Ambon''. He later resigned and became an advocate and politician, merging the ''Sarekat'' with the mainstream movement of Indonesian nationalism after initial rifts caused by the issue of religion in politics. Latuharhary moved to [[Jakarta]] and worked under the Department of Home Affairs during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] to manage Moluccans in Java, being arrested three times for different reasons. He took part in the initial drafting of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] through his membership of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence|BPUPKI]] and [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence|PPKI]], where he unsuccessfully championed [[federalism]] and opposed the inclusion of religion in government through the [[Jakarta Charter]] and later opposing the formation of the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]].\n\nFollowing the [[proclamation of Indonesian independence|proclamation of independence]], he was appointed [[Governor of Maluku]], but could not take power and instead organized Moluccans in Java to join the revolutionary cause. He was for some time part of the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] leadership and he participated in the Indonesian delegations of the [[Renville Agreement|Renville]] and the [[Roem\u2013van Roijen Agreement]]s. He eventually took office in 1950, where he attempted to establish the government and rebuild the ruined city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], before he was removed from his post. He died on 8 November 1959.\n\n==Early life and education==\nLatuharhary was born in [[Ullath]], [[Saparua]] on 6 July 1900, from the couple of Jan Latuharhary and Josefin Hiarej. Jan was a school teacher in the neighboring village. Johannes initially studied at the local first grade school in Saparua which taught students [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but he later moved to [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] at the age of 9 to study at a ''[[Europeesche Lagere School]]'' there. Though the school was primarily designated for Europeans, Johannes was admitted as his father was a teacher. He studied there until 1917,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=1\u20133}} before he moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] for higher education. He graduated from Batavia's [[Hogere Burgerschool]] in 1923.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=7}}\n\nHe later received a scholarship from the ''Ambonsch Studiefonds'' to study at the [[Leiden University]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=11}} Latuharhary was the first [[Moluccans|Moluccan]] to achieve a [[Master of Laws#Types of LL.M. degrees|Meester in de Rechten]] (Master of Law) degree from Leiden when he received it in June 1927. Throughout his time at Leiden, Latuharhary did not directly participate within the student organization [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]] (PI), but he had significant interactions with its members and is often considered as a member due to his connections with PI's leaders such as [[Ali Sastroamidjojo]] and [[Iwa Kusumasumantri]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}} When Latuharhary returned home, he had become a proponent of Indonesian nationalism and unity.{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n==Career==\n===Dutch East Indies===\nFollowing his return to the Indies, Latuharhary (who had secured a recommendation letter from his professor [[Cornelis van Vollenhoven]]) was hired as an assistant at [[Surabaya]]'s High Court,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=32}} and he was later promoted to a judge there before being appointed chief judge in the district court at Kraksaan (in what is today [[Probolinggo Regency]]) in 1929.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=45}} He also joined the ''Sarekat Ambon''/SA (Ambon Association) and worked on its reorganization. He was also assigned as the chief editor of SA's official newspaper ''Haloean'',{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=34}} and applied for SA to be granted legal status in 1930, though it did not receive it until 1933.{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|pp=137\u2013138}} Latuharhary also formed trade [[cooperative]] for Moluccans in response to the economic hardships from the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=44}}\n\nSeveral members of the SA had proposed for the organization to join the [[Association of Political Organisations of the Indonesian People]] (PPPKI), which consisted of various nationalist and local organizations such as the [[Indonesian National Party]], [[Sarekat Islam]] and [[Budi Utomo]]. Latuharhary was, however, opposed to the inclusion of religious organizations in political movements, and SA did not join the PPPKI initially.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=34}} Eventually, however, in SA's third congress in early 1932, the leadership made the decision to join PPPKI.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=43}} Latuharhary had previously participated in PPPKI's congress in January 1932, where he delivered his [[preamble]] ''Azab Sengsara Kepoelauan Maloekoe'' (Suffering of the Mollucas) which described economic devastation by the [[Dutch East India Company]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=48\u201349}} He also wrote that the Dutch education system for the Moluccans was geared towards creating \"scribes and clerks, soldiers and sailors\".{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=145}}\n\nThroughout this time, Latuharhary had leaned towards a more [[federalism|federalist]] structure for the future Indonesian state, in accordance to others such as [[Sam Ratulangi]], [[Tan Malaka]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]].{{sfn|Elson|2008|p=68}} In 1932, his preamble was published as a book, though it was censured by the colonial government. He later resigned from being chief judge following an ultimatum from the colonial government to pick between his job or being part of the nationalist movement, and he became a lawyer instead.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=50\u201351}} As an advocate, one of his first cases was suing sugar factories for taking over local farmers' land. Latuharhary won the case and gained local renown in East Java, and he was elected a member of the ''Regentschapsraad'' (municipal council) of Kraksaan. Latuharhary moved with his family to [[Malang]] in 1934 and later was elected to East Java's ''Provinciale Raad'' (provincial council). He was a member of the council until 1942.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Manus et al.|1993|pp=12-13}}\n\nLatuharhary was later named as chairman of the ''Jong Ambon'' (Ambon Youth) upon the organization's founding in 1936.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=55}} In 1939, Latuharhary ran for a seat in the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], campaigning in Ambon. Throughout the campaigns, Latuharhary spread his nationalist views and setup or restores several SA branches. In the end, he lost to a candidate from the ''Regentenbond'' (nobles' association).{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=151}} He later joined [[Great Indonesia Party|Parindra]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=56}}\n\n===Japanese occupation and early independence===\nFollowing the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese invasion and takeover]], Latuharhary alongside other Parindra leaders were arrested and imprisoned. After around four months, his wife managed to convince a Japanese Navy admiral to arrange for their release. On September 1942, Latuharhary moved to the recently renamed [[Jakarta]], where he took care of the wives and children of Moluccan and Timorese soldiers who were arrested or had evacuated to Australia.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=62\u201366}}\n\nAfter moving to Jakarta, Latuharhary also began working for the Japanese under the Department of Home Affairs to manage the Moluccans in Java, and held responsibility for their actions.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=67}}{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=196}} In 1944, a group of Ambonese including Latuharhary were arrested by the [[Kenpeitai]] and brought to Bogor as they were suspected of espionage for the Allied forces, and due to the fact that Latuharhary had partly used his position within the Japanese administration for political purposes.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=62\u201366}}{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=69}} However, his wife and two others again managed to convince a Japanese Navy commander to arrange for their release.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=62\u201366}} In late 1944, he was again arrested after a Moluccan prisoner escaped from a prison,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=67}} with the Japanese authorities being particularly suspicious of Ambonese after the [[Battle of Morotai]] and the strategic bombing of Ambon in 1944, further fueled by Allied espionage operations in the Moluccas led by Ambonese [[Julius Tahija]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=75}}\n\nBy early 1945, the Japanese began giving out promises of Indonesian independence, and the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPKI) was formed with Latuharhary as a member representing the Moluccas.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=75}} Latuharhary had called a meeting of Ambonese leaders in Java on May 1945, passing over statements which said the Japanese authorities wanted the Ambonese to stop resistance activities and participate in the independence movement.{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=196}} At BPUPKI, Latuharhary proposed the formation of a federal state over an unitary state, but the proposal was shot down after only 2 out of 19 members of the constitutional body voted for federalism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=He |first1=Baogang |last2=Galligan |first2=Brian |last3=Inoguchi |first3=Takashi |title=Federalism in Asia |date=2009 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=9781847207029 |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXf9C2xbKsYC&pg=PA144 |language=en}}</ref> He was also opposed to the [[Jakarta Charter|inclusion of the seven words]] ''dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluknya'' (an obligation of [[sharia]] for Muslims) due to its consequences for non-Muslims and to its impact on customary laws,{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=115}} and later also opposed a proposition by [[Wahid Hasyim]] that only Muslims would be allowed to become President and/or Vice President, noting that the majority Christian regions in Indonesia would not be willing to be part of an Islamic state.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=77\u201378}} The proposal was also opposed by secular nationalists such as [[Wongsonegoro]] and {{ill|Husein Jayadiningrat|id}}.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Intan |first1=Benyamin Fleming |title=\"Public Religion\" and the Pancasila-based State of Indonesia: An Ethical and Sociological Analysis |date=2006 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=9780820476032 |pages=41\u201342 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXmRwiYEy1IC&pg=PA41 |language=en}}</ref> Eventually, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Putra Maluku yang Tak Melupakan Sagu |url=http://arsip.gatra.com/2012-08-13/majalah/artikel.php?id=152427 |accessdate=6 September 2019 |work=Gatra |date=13 August 2012 |language=id}}</ref> Latuharhary (alongside the other Christian representative [[Alexander Andries Maramis]]) yielded following Sukarno's request.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=79}} Later on, Latuharhary was further appointed to BPUPKI's successor, the [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence]] (PPKI).{{sfn|Anderson|2006|p=64}}\n\nLater on, however, the clauses preferring Islam was removed from the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] and the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]], following a visit from a Japanese navy officer to [[Muhammad Hatta]] on the evening of 17 August (shortly after the [[proclamation of Indonesian independence]] that morning, where Latuharhary was present{{sfn|Manus et al.|1993|p=14}}), warning the latter that Christian nationalists from Eastern Indonesia{{efn|[[Robert Elson]] wrote that the referred persons were among the five members of BPUPKI from outside [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]]: Latuharhary, Maramis, [[Sam Ratulangi]], {{ill|Andi Pangerang Pettarani|id}} and [[I Gusti Ketut Pudja]], who had shown disagreement during the drafting of the clauses.{{sfn|Elson|2009|pp=120\u2013121}}}} \"prefer to stand outside the Republic of Indonesia\" unless the seven words were removed. Hatta called an emergency meeting and managed to convince the Muslim nationalists to yield on the clauses, and the assembly further removed several terms and clauses{{efn|As examples, the words \"Allah\" and \"Mukadimah\" ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for \"God\" and \"Preamble\") were replaced with \"Tuhan\" and \"Pembukaan\" respectively \u2013 more generic terms, though \"Allah\" eventually remained in the Constitution.{{sfn|Elson|2009|pp=120\u2013121}}}} which was seen as favoring Islam.{{sfn|Elson|2009|pp=120\u2013121}} Latuharhary was also opposed to the formation of a [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|religious ministry]] and proposed it be included as a bureau under the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] instead \u2013 the formation failed at first, though a religious ministry was eventually formed in January 1946.{{sfn|Elson|2009|pp=120\u2013121}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Sekilas Tentang Kementerian Agama |url=https://kemenag.go.id/home/artikel/42956/sejarah |publisher=[[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] |accessdate=5 September 2019 |language=id |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905183631/https://kemenag.go.id/home/artikel/42956/sejarah |archive-date=5 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Revolution===\nLatuharhary was appointed as the Governor of Maluku on 19 August 1945, alongside governors for 7 other formed provinces.

The outcome of the meeting was to support the independence movement. Soon afterwards, however, the Dutch returned under the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]] with [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|KNIL]] soldiers, a number of whom were Ambonese.

He was the first Indonesian governor of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], serving between 1950 and 1955.\n\nAn early proponent of Moluccan inclusion in the Indonesian state, Latuharhary was born in [[Saparua]] and moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to pursue higher education, before receiving a scholarship to study at [[Leiden University]]. Upon his return, he worked as a judge in [[East Java]] and began participating in the Indonesian nationalist movement through the ''Sarekat Ambon''. He later resigned and became an advocate and politician, merging the ''Sarekat'' with the mainstream movement of Indonesian nationalism after initial rifts caused by the issue of religion in politics. Latuharhary moved to [[Jakarta]] and worked under the Department of Home Affairs during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] to manage Moluccans in Java, being arrested three times for different reasons. He took part in the initial drafting of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] through his membership of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence|BPUPKI]] and [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence|PPKI]], where he unsuccessfully championed [[federalism]] and opposed the inclusion of religion in government through the [[Jakarta Charter]] and later opposing the formation of the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]].\n\nFollowing the [[proclamation of Indonesian independence|proclamation of independence]], he was appointed [[Governor of Maluku]], but could not take power and instead organized Moluccans in Java to join the revolutionary cause. He was for some time part of the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] leadership and he participated in the Indonesian delegations of the [[Renville Agreement|Renville]] and the [[Roem\u2013van Roijen Agreement]]s. He eventually took office in 1950, where he attempted to establish the government and rebuild the ruined city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], before he was removed from his post. He died on 8 November 1959.\n\n==Early life and education==\nLatuharhary was born in [[Ullath]], [[Saparua]] on 6 July 1900, from the couple of Jan Latuharhary and Josefin Hiarej. Jan was a school teacher in the neighboring village. Johannes initially studied at the local first grade school in Saparua which taught students [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but he later moved to [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] at the age of 9 to study at a ''[[Europeesche Lagere School]]'' there. Though the school was primarily designated for Europeans, Johannes was admitted as his father was a teacher. He studied there until 1917,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=1\u20133}} before he moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] for higher education. He graduated from Batavia's [[Hogere Burgerschool]] in 1923.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=7}}\n\nHe later received a scholarship from the ''Ambonsch Studiefonds'' to study at the [[Leiden University]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=11}} Latuharhary was the first [[Moluccans|Moluccan]] to achieve a [[Master of Laws#Types of LL.M. degrees|Meester in de Rechten]] (Master of Law) degree from Leiden when he received it in June 1927. Throughout his time at Leiden, Latuharhary did not directly participate within the student organization [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]] (PI), but he had significant interactions with its members and is often considered as a member due to his connections with PI's leaders such as [[Ali Sastroamidjojo]] and [[Iwa Kusumasumantri]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}} When Latuharhary returned home, he had become a proponent of Indonesian nationalism and unity.{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n==Career==\n===Dutch East Indies===\nFollowing his return to the Indies, Latuharhary (who had secured a recommendation letter from his professor [[Cornelis van Vollenhoven]]) was hired as an assistant at [[Surabaya]]'s High Court,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=32}} and he was later promoted to a judge there before being appointed chief judge in the district court at Kraksaan (in what is today [[Probolinggo Regency]]) in 1929.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=45}} He also joined the ''Sarekat Ambon''/SA (Ambon Association) and worked on its reorganization. He was also assigned as the chief editor of SA's official newspaper ''Haloean'',{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=34}} and applied for SA to be granted legal status in 1930, though it did not receive it until 1933.{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|pp=137\u2013138}} Latuharhary also formed trade [[cooperative]] for Moluccans in response to the economic hardships from the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=44}}\n\nSeveral members of the SA had proposed for the organization to join the [[Association of Political Organisations of the Indonesian People]] (PPPKI), which consisted of various nationalist and local organizations such as the [[Indonesian National Party]], [[Sarekat Islam]] and [[Budi Utomo]]. Latuharhary was, however, opposed to the inclusion of religious organizations in political movements, and SA did not join the PPPKI initially.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=34}} Eventually, however, in SA's third congress in early 1932, the leadership made the decision to join PPPKI.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=43}} Latuharhary had previously participated in PPPKI's congress in January 1932, where he delivered his [[preamble]] ''Azab Sengsara Kepoelauan Maloekoe'' (Suffering of the Mollucas) which described economic devastation by the [[Dutch East India Company]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=48\u201349}} He also wrote that the Dutch education system for the Moluccans was geared towards creating \"scribes and clerks, soldiers and sailors\".{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=145}}\n\nThroughout this time, Latuharhary had leaned towards a more [[federalism|federalist]] structure for the future Indonesian state, in accordance to others such as [[Sam Ratulangi]], [[Tan Malaka]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]].{{sfn|Elson|2008|p=68}} In 1932, his preamble was published as a book, though it was censured by the colonial government. He later resigned from being chief judge following an ultimatum from the colonial government to pick between his job or being part of the nationalist movement, and he became a lawyer instead.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=50\u201351}} As an advocate, one of his first cases was suing sugar factories for taking over local farmers' land. Latuharhary won the case and gained local renown in East Java, and he was elected a member of the ''Regentschapsraad'' (municipal council) of Kraksaan. Latuharhary moved with his family to [[Malang]] in 1934 and later was elected to East Java's ''Provinciale Raad'' (provincial council). He was a member of the council until 1942.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Manus et al.|1993|pp=12-13}}\n\nLatuharhary was later named as chairman of the ''Jong Ambon'' (Ambon Youth) upon the organization's founding in 1936.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=55}} In 1939, Latuharhary ran for a seat in the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], campaigning in Ambon. Throughout the campaigns, Latuharhary spread his nationalist views and setup or restores several SA branches. In the end, he lost to a candidate from the ''Regentenbond'' (nobles' association).{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=151}} He later joined [[Great Indonesia Party|Parindra]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=56}}\n\n===Japanese occupation and early independence===\nFollowing the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese invasion and takeover]], Latuharhary alongside other Parindra leaders were arrested and imprisoned.
