Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies as incentives to develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries; the process of awarding land grants are not limited to the countries named below. The United States historically gave out numerous land grants as Homesteads to individuals desiring to prove a farm. The American Industrial Revolution was guided by many supportive acts of legislatures (for example, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] legislation of 1826) promoting commerce or [[transportation]] [[infrastructure]] development by private companies, such as the [[Cumberland Road]] [[Toll road|turnpike]], the [[Lehigh Canal]], the [[Schuylkill Canal]], and the many railroads that tied the young United States together.fa\n\n==Ancient Rome==\n[[Military history of ancient Rome|Roman soldiers]] were given [[pensions]] (''[[Aerarium militare#Benefits|praemia]]'') at the end of their service including cash or land.

Spain and Mexico used the same system of offering land grants along the Rio Grande River near the Texas/Mexico border. These grants were given to help colonization of the area by Mexican and Spanish nationals, and strengthen frontier towns along the Texas border. During the [[Ranchos of California#Mexican era|Mexican period]] of [[California]] (and other portions of Mexican territories inherited from [[New Spain]]),the Mexican government granted individuals hundreds of [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] or large tracts of land.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 established the [[Northwest Territory]], pursuant to which homesteading settlers could buy land, and certain land was set aside for public schools and other purposes. The Federal Government acquired additional lands by treaties with various Native American Tribes, such as the 1833 [[Treaty of Chicago]] by which many eastern tribes agreed to settle across the [[Mississippi River]].

It consists of several neighborhoods and villages including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn Of River, Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury and Palmers Hill. North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the City of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the North, the Long Island Sound to the South, Greenwich, Connecticut to the West, Darien to the East, and New Canaan to the Northeast.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|52.09|sqmi|km2}}, making it the largest city by area in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stamford Master Plan |url=https://www.stamfordct.gov/sites/stamfordct/files/u358/final_draft_12.16.14_0.pdf |website=stamfordct.gov |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''),  with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Stamford, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.\n\nThe warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Stamford. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.\n\nAlthough infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nStamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. Stamford averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford\u2014averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stamford, Connecticut\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  69\n|Feb record high F =  74\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record

[[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] serves as the main route through downtown Stamford with four exits (6\u20139). The [[Merritt Parkway]] runs through the northern part of the city. This road is designated for passenger vehicles only. Any congestion on the Merritt Parkway is mostly likely to occur on the southbound lane in the morning and the northbound in the evening (route to and from New York). At night, due to the absence of lighting, visibility on the Merritt Parkway is relatively poor. Stamford exits on the Merritt Parkway are 33\u201335, and exit 36 is just over the border in New Canaan.\n\nStamford is also served by four other state highways. [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|Route{{nbsp}}1]], also known as Main Street in Stamford, is also used as a major artery during the morning and evening commute. Most traffic via Route{{nbsp}}1 is short distance or fairly local, yet vehicles have utilized Route{{nbsp}}1 during times of heavy congestion on I-95 as a re-route. [[Connecticut Route 137|Route 137]] (Washington Boulevard and High Ridge Road) is the main north\u2013south road of the city and runs from the Stamford Transportation Center and serves the Turn of River, North Stamford, and High Ridge sections of the city.

Although providing a public education is a state responsibility, Connecticut ranks near the bottom in state share of public education expenditures. Thus, the majority of education funding must come from local governments like that of Stamford. According to the State Department of Education, in the 2004\u201305 academic year, 42.7% of Stamford's public school students were economically disadvantaged, 34.8% did not have English as a home language and 11.6% were students with disabilities. Research has shown that these populations need additional resources to meet state academic standards. Owing to the state school finance system, the burden of these extra necessary costs of education falls primarily on Stamford's local government. The public school system is an integrated district with racial balance requirements exceeding those of the state of Connecticut. State standards require that a school's racial makeup be within 25% of the community's racial makeup. Stamford's standard is a more strict 10%. Over the years, schools have become unbalanced.\n\nStamford has three public [[high school]]s: [[Westhill High School (Connecticut)|Westhill High School]], [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]], and the [[Academy of Information Technology and Engineering]].

By the 18th century, one of the primary industries of the town was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford's proximity to New York.\n[[File:Stamford Aerial 2017.png|thumb|250x250px|Downtown and South End neighborhoods of Stamford.

Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.\n\nIn 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.268</ref> A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D.

The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many of the other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story [[Trump Parc Stamford]] condominium tower, and then again by the Atlantic Station development, another project by the Rich Company in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|title=Commercial Property /Stamford, Conn.; A Pioneer Business Park That Confounded Critics|first=Eleanor|last=Charles|date=September 26, 1999|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued, with breaks during downturns in the economy, through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.\n\nSince 2008, an 80-acre mixed-use redevelopment project for the Stamford's [[Harbor Point, Stamford|Harbor Point]] neighborhood has added additional growth south of the city's [[Downtown Stamford|Downtown]] area.

[[Long Island Sound]] is completely dark.]]\n\n  \nStamford is situated near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on [[Long Island Sound]]. It consists of several neighborhoods and villages including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn Of River, Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury and Palmers Hill. North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the City of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the North, the Long Island Sound to the South, Greenwich, Connecticut to the West, Darien to the East, and New Canaan to the Northeast.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|52.09|sqmi|km2}}, making it the largest city by area in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stamford Master Plan |url=https://www.stamfordct.gov/sites/stamfordct/files/u358/final_draft_12.16.14_0.pdf |website=stamfordct.gov |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''),  with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Stamford, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.\n\nThe warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Stamford. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.\n\nAlthough infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nStamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. Stamford averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford\u2014averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stamford, Connecticut\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  69\n|Feb record high F =  74\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record

[[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] serves as the main route through downtown Stamford with four exits (6\u20139). The [[Merritt Parkway]] runs through the northern part of the city. This road is designated for passenger vehicles only. Any congestion on the Merritt Parkway is mostly likely to occur on the southbound lane in the morning and the northbound in the evening (route to and from New York). At night, due to the absence of lighting, visibility on the Merritt Parkway is relatively poor. Stamford exits on the Merritt Parkway are 33\u201335, and exit 36 is just over the border in New Canaan.\n\nStamford is also served by four other state highways. [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|Route{{nbsp}}1]], also known as Main Street in Stamford, is also used as a major artery during the morning and evening commute. Most traffic via Route{{nbsp}}1 is short distance or fairly local, yet vehicles have utilized Route{{nbsp}}1 during times of heavy congestion on I-95 as a re-route. [[Connecticut Route 137|Route 137]] (Washington Boulevard and High Ridge Road) is the main north\u2013south road of the city and runs from the Stamford Transportation Center and serves the Turn of River, North Stamford, and High Ridge sections of the city.

Although providing a public education is a state responsibility, Connecticut ranks near the bottom in state share of public education expenditures. Thus, the majority of education funding must come from local governments like that of Stamford. According to the State Department of Education, in the 2004\u201305 academic year, 42.7% of Stamford's public school students were economically disadvantaged, 34.8% did not have English as a home language and 11.6% were students with disabilities. Research has shown that these populations need additional resources to meet state academic standards. Owing to the state school finance system, the burden of these extra necessary costs of education falls primarily on Stamford's local government. The public school system is an integrated district with racial balance requirements exceeding those of the state of Connecticut. State standards require that a school's racial makeup be within 25% of the community's racial makeup. Stamford's standard is a more strict 10%. Over the years, schools have become unbalanced.\n\nStamford has three public [[high school]]s: [[Westhill High School (Connecticut)|Westhill High School]], [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]], and the [[Academy of Information Technology and Engineering]].

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.
