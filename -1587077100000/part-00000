The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzm\u00e1n's diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a \"same small indigenous fishing town\". In 1517, Don [[Gaspar de Espinosa]], a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzm\u00e1n described. In 1519, [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]] decided to establish the Spanish Empire's Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced [[Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua del Dari\u00e9n]], which had lost its function within the Crown's global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began.\n\nThe official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama's Ministry of Education is the \"abundance of fish, trees and butterflies\".

The existence of the [[isthmus]] affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.<ref name=\"Mayo, J 2004\">Mayo, J.

Later central Panama was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500\u20131700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500\u2013900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their beautiful [[Gran Cocl\u00e9]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.\n\nBefore Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by [[Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce.\n\nWhen Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[acquired immunity]] to diseases which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.<ref>Hays, J. N. (2005).

A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the [[New World]]. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way.\n\nPanama was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] for almost 300 years (1538\u20131821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of \"geographic destiny\", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La inmigraci\u00f3n prohibida en Panam\u00e1 y sus prejuicios raciales|last=Arango Durling |trans-title=Prohibited immigration in Panam\u00e1 and its racial prejudices |first=Virginia |publisher=Publipan |year=1999 |lccn=2001388757 |location=Panam\u00e1  |language=Spanish |pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1538 the [[Real Audiencia of Panama]] was established, initially with [[jurisdiction]] from Nicaragua to [[Cape Horn]], until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an ''[[oidor]]'' (Spanish: hearer, a judge).\n\nSpanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as \"indios de guerra\" (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them.  However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe.  Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment.\n\nBecause of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from \"new world\" Africans called [[cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on Panama in 1572\u201373 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the [[Pacific Ocean]] were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pike, Ruth |title=Black Rebels: Cimarrons in Sixteenth Century Panama|journal=The Americas|volume= 64|issue=2 |year=2007|pages= 243\u201366|doi=10.1353/tam.2007.0161}}</ref>\n\nThe prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540\u20131740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire \u2013 the first modern global empire \u2013 helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies.\n\nThe end of the [[encomienda]] system in [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]], however, sparked the conquest of [[Veraguas]] in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco V\u00e1zquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the [[Azuero Peninsula]], set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors.\n\nPanama was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of England and Scotland in 1707.<ref>\"[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm The Darien Scheme \u2013 The Fall of Scotland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194052/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}\", Historic UK</ref>\n\nIn 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo|Panama]] \u2013 the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]] (the modern capital of [[Colombia]]) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogot\u00e1 would persist for centuries.\n\nIn 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.\n\n====1800s====\n\n[[File:Arco chato.jpg|thumb|[[Santo Domingo Church]]]]\nAs the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[province|Azuero]] without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.\n\nNevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.\n\nIt was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of Panama#Jos\u00e9 de F\u00e1brega|Jos\u00e9 Pedro Antonio de F\u00e1brega y de las Cuevas]] (1774\u20131841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.\n\nWhat they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Murge\u00f3n]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting F\u00e1brega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, F\u00e1brega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, F\u00e1brega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence.

It mostly lies between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7\u00b0]] and [[10th parallel north|10\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[77th meridian west|77\u00b0]] and [[83rd meridian west|83\u00b0W]] (a small area lies west of 83\u00b0).\n\nIts location on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the [[Panama Canal]] which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the North of the Pacific Ocean.  Panama's total area is 74,177.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=https://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/archivos/P6221DATOS%20GENERALES%20%20%20%202013.pdf |title=Datos generales e hist\u00f3ricos de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 |language=es |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama|INEC]] |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant feature of Panama's geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the [[continental divide]]. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the [[Andes|Andean]] system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.\n\nThe mountain range of the divide is called the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serran\u00eda de Tabasar\u00e1, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]].\n\nThe highest point in the country is the [[Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa]], which rises to {{convert|3,475|m|abbr=off}}. A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]] between Panama and Colombia where Colombian [[guerrilla]]s and drug dealers operate and sometimes take [[hostage-taking|hostages]]. This and unrest, and forest protection movements, create a break in the [[Pan-American Highway]], which otherwise forms a complete road from [[Alaska]] to [[Patagonia]].\n\nPanama's wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife.\n\n[[File:chagres.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagres River]]]]\n\n===Waterways===\n{{main|Panama Canal}}\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the [[R\u00edo Chagres]] (''Chagres River''), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The central part of the river is dammed by the [[Gatun Dam]] and forms [[Gatun Lake]], an [[artificial lake]] that constitutes part of the [[Panama Canal]]. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the R\u00edo Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once  created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.\n\nThe R\u00edo Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the [[R\u00edo Tuira]], which flows into the [[Golfo de San Miguel]] and is the nation's only river that is navigable by larger vessels.\n\n===Harbors===\nThe Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors.

Temperatures are uniformly high\u2014as is the relative humidity\u2014and there is little seasonal variation. [[Diurnal temperature variation|Diurnal ranges]] are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}} and the afternoon maximum {{convert|30|\u00b0C|1}}. The temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}} for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] in western Panama.\n\nClimatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on [[rain]]fall, which varies regionally from less than {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the [[continental divide]]. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Col\u00f3n. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the [[hurricane belt]].\n\nPanama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, [[deforestation]] is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. [[Mangrove swamp]]s occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied [[rain forest]] abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Panama}}\n\n[[File:Asamblea Nacional de Panam\u00e1.JPG|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Panama]]]]\nPanama's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Panama]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nNational elections are universal and mandatory for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama's [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]] is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections requires a simple majority; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8031425.stm Tycoon elected Panama's president] Retrieved July 25, 2010</ref>\n\n===Political culture===\nSince the end of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has successfully completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and many smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] is the son of general [[Omar Torrijos]]. He succeeded [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of [[Arnulfo Arias]]. Panama's most recent [[Panamanian general election, 2014|national elections occurred on May 4, 2014]], with incumbent vice-President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] declared the victor. The [[2019 Panamanian general election]] is scheduled for May 5, 2019, with current President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] being ineligible due to constitutional limits for a second term. \n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Panama}}\n[[File:John Kerry con Juan Carlos Varela e Isabel Saint Malo.jpg|thumb|left|Panama's President-elect [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and Vice President [[Isabel Saint Malo]] with then-US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] just before Varela's inauguration in 2014]]\n\nThe United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.\n\n===Military===\n{{Further|Panamanian Public Forces}}\n\nThe [[Panamanian Public Forces]] are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being [[Costa Rica]]) to permanently abolish its standing army. Panama maintains armed police and security forces, and small air and maritime forces. They are tasked with law enforcement and can perform limited military actions.\n\nIn 2017, Panama signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Panama adheres to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |url=https://www.panamatoday.com/panama/panama-adheres-treaty-prohibition-nuclear-weapons-5273 |work=Panama Today |date=20 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Image label begin|image=Divisi\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de Panam\u00e1.svg|width=400|float=right}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.06|y=0.08|scale=500|text=[[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.43|y=0.19|scale=500|text=[[Cocl\u00e9 Province|Cocl\u00e9]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.54|y=0.07|scale=500|text=[[Col\u00f3n Province|Col\u00f3n]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.07|y=0.19|scale=500|text=[[Chiriqu\u00ed Province|Chiriqu\u00ed]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.81|y=0.23|scale=500|text=[[Dari\u00e9n Province|Dari\u00e9n]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.38|y=0.31|scale=500|text=[[Herrera Province|Herrera]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.42|y=0.36|scale=500|text=[[Los Santos Province|Los Santos]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.62|y=0.09|scale=500|text=[[Panam\u00e1 Province|Panam\u00e1]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.50|y=0.15|scale=500|text=[[Panam\u00e1 Oeste Province|West Panam\u00e1]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.28|y=0.28|scale=500|text=[[Veraguas Province|Veraguas]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.78|y=0.05|scale=500|text=[[Guna Yala]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.90|y=0.21|scale=500|text=[[Comarca Ember\u00e1-Wounaan]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.77|y=0.32|scale=500|text=[[Comarca Ember\u00e1-Wounaan]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.19|y=0.18|scale=500|text=[[Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 Comarca]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.74|y=0.10|scale=500|text=[[Kuna de Madugand\u00ed]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.82|y=0.13|scale=500|text=[[Kuna de Wargand\u00ed]]}}\n{{Image label end}}\n\n{{Main|Provinces and regions of Panama}}\nPanama is divided into ten provinces with their respective local authorities (governors).

Public education began as a national and governmental institution in 1903. The principle underlying the early education system was that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society.\n\n[[Public education]] began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by an extremely paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, \"The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.\" This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.<ref name=\"cs\">{{Country study|country=Panama|abbr=pa|editor=Sandra W.

[[Hegemonic]] forces have created [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms blending [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture with [[Culture of Europe|European culture]].

Panama's blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as [[woodcarving]]s, ceremonial masks and [[pottery]], as well as in Panama's architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.\n\nAn example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the [[Guna Yala|Guna]] who are known for ''[[mola (art form)|molas]]''. ''Mola'' is the Guna word for blouse, but the term ''mola'' has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman's blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse [[appliqu\u00e9]] process.\n\n===Holidays and festivities===\n{{Further|Public holidays in Panama}}\n\nThe Christmas parade, known as ''El desfile de Navidad'', is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called ''[[pollera]]'' and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|date=June 23, 2010|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2030.htm|title=Panama}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n{{Further|Panamanian cuisine}}\nSince Panama's cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premiercasa.com/en/panama/panama-guide/a-guide-to-panama-food-culture|title=A Guide to Panama Food Culture|website=www.premiercasa.com}}</ref> \na mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\nThe famous fish market known as the \"Mercado de Mariscos\" offers fresh seafood and [[Ceviche]], a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and [[Empanada]], which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry  is the [[pastelito]], with the only difference in comparison to [[empanada]]s is that they are bigger.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nTypical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[maize]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n\nPanamanian men's traditional clothing, called ''montuno'', consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.\n\nThe traditional women's clothing is the ''pollera''. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (''De Zarate'' 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.\n\nA ''pollera'' is made of \"[[cambric]]\" or \"fine linen\" (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.\n\nThe original ''pollera'' consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock's tail or a ''[[mantilla]]'' fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching [[pom pom]]s (''mota'') are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (''caberstrillos'') hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a [[choker]], and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (''zaricillos'') are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the ''pollera''. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (''tembleques'') worn like a crown. Quality ''pollera'' can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.\n\nToday, there are different types of ''polleras''; the ''pollera de gala'' consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a [[petticoat]]. Girls wear ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170518133519/http://panamafolktembleques.com/ tembleques]'' in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The ''pollera montuna'' is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000349/http://discoverytheater.org/education/guides/2010/Celebremos%20Panama!%20Resource%20Guide.pdf Celebremos Panama!].

The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzm\u00e1n's diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a \"same small indigenous fishing town\". In 1517, Don [[Gaspar de Espinosa]], a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzm\u00e1n described. In 1519, [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]] decided to establish the Spanish Empire's Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced [[Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua del Dari\u00e9n]], which had lost its function within the Crown's global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began.\n\nThe official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama's Ministry of Education is the \"abundance of fish, trees and butterflies\".

The existence of the [[isthmus]] affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.<ref name=\"Mayo, J 2004\">Mayo, J.

Later central Panama was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500\u20131700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500\u2013900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their beautiful [[Gran Cocl\u00e9]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.\n\nBefore Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by [[Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce.\n\nWhen Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[acquired immunity]] to diseases which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.<ref>Hays, J. N. (2005).

A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the [[New World]]. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way.\n\nPanama was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] for almost 300 years (1538\u20131821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of \"geographic destiny\", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La inmigraci\u00f3n prohibida en Panam\u00e1 y sus prejuicios raciales|last=Arango Durling |trans-title=Prohibited immigration in Panam\u00e1 and its racial prejudices |first=Virginia |publisher=Publipan |year=1999 |lccn=2001388757 |location=Panam\u00e1  |language=Spanish |pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1538 the [[Real Audiencia of Panama]] was established, initially with [[jurisdiction]] from Nicaragua to [[Cape Horn]], until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an ''[[oidor]]'' (Spanish: hearer, a judge).\n\nSpanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as \"indios de guerra\" (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them.  However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe.  Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment.\n\nBecause of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from \"new world\" Africans called [[cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on Panama in 1572\u201373 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the [[Pacific Ocean]] were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pike, Ruth |title=Black Rebels: Cimarrons in Sixteenth Century Panama|journal=The Americas|volume= 64|issue=2 |year=2007|pages= 243\u201366|doi=10.1353/tam.2007.0161}}</ref>\n\nThe prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540\u20131740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire \u2013 the first modern global empire \u2013 helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies.\n\nThe end of the [[encomienda]] system in [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]], however, sparked the conquest of [[Veraguas]] in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco V\u00e1zquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the [[Azuero Peninsula]], set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors.\n\nPanama was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of England and Scotland in 1707.<ref>\"[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm The Darien Scheme \u2013 The Fall of Scotland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194052/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}\", Historic UK</ref>\n\nIn 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo|Panama]] \u2013 the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]] (the modern capital of [[Colombia]]) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogot\u00e1 would persist for centuries.\n\nIn 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.\n\n====1800s====\n\n[[File:Arco chato.jpg|thumb|[[Santo Domingo Church]]]]\nAs the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[province|Azuero]] without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.\n\nNevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.\n\nIt was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of Panama#Jos\u00e9 de F\u00e1brega|Jos\u00e9 Pedro Antonio de F\u00e1brega y de las Cuevas]] (1774\u20131841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.\n\nWhat they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Murge\u00f3n]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting F\u00e1brega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, F\u00e1brega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, F\u00e1brega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.\n\n===Post-colonial Panama===\n[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 political cartoon.

It mostly lies between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7\u00b0]] and [[10th parallel north|10\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[77th meridian west|77\u00b0]] and [[83rd meridian west|83\u00b0W]] (a small area lies west of 83\u00b0).\n\nIts location on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the [[Panama Canal]] which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the North of the Pacific Ocean.  Panama's total area is 74,177.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=https://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/archivos/P6221DATOS%20GENERALES%20%20%20%202013.pdf |title=Datos generales e hist\u00f3ricos de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 |language=es |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama|INEC]] |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant feature of Panama's geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the [[continental divide]]. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the [[Andes|Andean]] system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.\n\nThe mountain range of the divide is called the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serran\u00eda de Tabasar\u00e1, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]].\n\nThe highest point in the country is the [[Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa]], which rises to {{convert|3,475|m|abbr=off}}. A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]] between Panama and Colombia where Colombian [[guerrilla]]s and drug dealers operate and sometimes take [[hostage-taking|hostages]]. This and unrest, and forest protection movements, create a break in the [[Pan-American Highway]], which otherwise forms a complete road from [[Alaska]] to [[Patagonia]].\n\nPanama's wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife.\n\n[[File:chagres.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagres River]]]]\n\n===Waterways===\n{{main|Panama Canal}}\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the [[R\u00edo Chagres]] (''Chagres River''), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The central part of the river is dammed by the [[Gatun Dam]] and forms [[Gatun Lake]], an [[artificial lake]] that constitutes part of the [[Panama Canal]]. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the R\u00edo Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once  created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.\n\nThe R\u00edo Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the [[R\u00edo Tuira]], which flows into the [[Golfo de San Miguel]] and is the nation's only river that is navigable by larger vessels.\n\n===Harbors===\nThe Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors.

Temperatures are uniformly high\u2014as is the relative humidity\u2014and there is little seasonal variation. [[Diurnal temperature variation|Diurnal ranges]] are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}} and the afternoon maximum {{convert|30|\u00b0C|1}}. The temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}} for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] in western Panama.\n\nClimatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on [[rain]]fall, which varies regionally from less than {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the [[continental divide]]. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Col\u00f3n. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the hurricane belt.\n\nPanama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, [[deforestation]] is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. [[Mangrove swamp]]s occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied [[rain forest]] abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Panama}}\n\n[[File:Asamblea Nacional de Panam\u00e1.JPG|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Panama]]]]\nPanama's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Panama]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nNational elections are universal and mandatory for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama's [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]] is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections requires a simple majority; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8031425.stm Tycoon elected Panama's president] Retrieved July 25, 2010</ref>\n\n===Political culture===\nSince the end of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has successfully completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and many smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] is the son of general [[Omar Torrijos]]. He succeeded [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of [[Arnulfo Arias]]. Panama's most recent [[Panamanian general election, 2014|national elections occurred on May 4, 2014]], with incumbent vice-President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] declared the victor. The [[2019 Panamanian general election]] is scheduled for May 5, 2019, with current President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] being ineligible due to constitutional limits for a second term. \n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Panama}}\n[[File:John Kerry con Juan Carlos Varela e Isabel Saint Malo.jpg|thumb|left|Panama's President-elect [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and Vice President [[Isabel Saint Malo]] with then-US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] just before Varela's inauguration in 2014]]\n\nThe United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.\n\n===Military===\n{{Further|Panamanian Public Forces}}\n\nThe [[Panamanian Public Forces]] are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being [[Costa Rica]]) to permanently abolish its standing army. Panama maintains armed police and security forces, and small air and maritime forces. They are tasked with law enforcement and can perform limited military actions.\n\nIn 2017, Panama signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Panama adheres to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |url=https://www.panamatoday.com/panama/panama-adheres-treaty-prohibition-nuclear-weapons-5273 |work=Panama Today |date=20 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Image label begin|image=Divisi\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de Panam\u00e1.svg|width=400|float=right}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.06|y=0.08|scale=500|text=[[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.43|y=0.19|scale=500|text=[[Cocl\u00e9 Province|Cocl\u00e9]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.54|y=0.07|scale=500|text=[[Col\u00f3n Province|Col\u00f3n]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.07|y=0.19|scale=500|text=[[Chiriqu\u00ed Province|Chiriqu\u00ed]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.81|y=0.23|scale=500|text=[[Dari\u00e9n Province|Dari\u00e9n]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.38|y=0.31|scale=500|text=[[Herrera Province|Herrera]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.42|y=0.36|scale=500|text=[[Los Santos Province|Los Santos]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.62|y=0.09|scale=500|text=[[Panam\u00e1 Province|Panam\u00e1]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.50|y=0.15|scale=500|text=[[Panam\u00e1 Oeste Province|West Panam\u00e1]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.28|y=0.28|scale=500|text=[[Veraguas Province|Veraguas]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.78|y=0.05|scale=500|text=[[Guna Yala]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.90|y=0.21|scale=500|text=[[Comarca Ember\u00e1-Wounaan]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.77|y=0.32|scale=500|text=[[Comarca Ember\u00e1-Wounaan]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.19|y=0.18|scale=500|text=[[Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 Comarca]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.74|y=0.10|scale=500|text=[[Kuna de Madugand\u00ed]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.82|y=0.13|scale=500|text=[[Kuna de Wargand\u00ed]]}}\n{{Image label end}}\n\n{{Main|Provinces and regions of Panama}}\nPanama is divided into ten provinces with their respective local authorities (governors).

Public education began as a national and governmental institution in 1903. The principle underlying the early education system was that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society.\n\n[[Public education]] began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by an extremely paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, \"The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.\" This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.<ref name=\"cs\">{{Country study|country=Panama|abbr=pa|editor=Sandra W.

[[Hegemonic]] forces have created [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms blending [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture with [[Culture of Europe|European culture]].

Panama's blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as [[woodcarving]]s, ceremonial masks and [[pottery]], as well as in Panama's architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.\n\nAn example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the [[Guna Yala|Guna]] who are known for ''[[mola (art form)|molas]]''. ''Mola'' is the Guna word for blouse, but the term ''mola'' has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman's blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse [[appliqu\u00e9]] process.\n\n===Holidays and festivities===\n{{Further|Public holidays in Panama}}\n\nThe Christmas parade, known as ''El desfile de Navidad'', is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called ''[[pollera]]'' and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|date=June 23, 2010|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2030.htm|title=Panama}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n{{Further|Panamanian cuisine}}\nSince Panama's cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premiercasa.com/en/panama/panama-guide/a-guide-to-panama-food-culture|title=A Guide to Panama Food Culture|website=www.premiercasa.com}}</ref> \na mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\nThe famous fish market known as the \"Mercado de Mariscos\" offers fresh seafood and [[Ceviche]], a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and [[Empanada]], which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry  is the [[pastelito]], with the only difference in comparison to [[empanada]]s is that they are bigger.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nTypical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[maize]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n\nPanamanian men's traditional clothing, called ''montuno'', consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.\n\nThe traditional women's clothing is the ''pollera''. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (''De Zarate'' 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.\n\nA ''pollera'' is made of \"[[cambric]]\" or \"fine linen\" (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.\n\nThe original ''pollera'' consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock's tail or a ''[[mantilla]]'' fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching [[pom pom]]s (''mota'') are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (''caberstrillos'') hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a [[choker]], and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (''zaricillos'') are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the ''pollera''. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (''tembleques'') worn like a crown. Quality ''pollera'' can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.\n\nToday, there are different types of ''polleras''; the ''pollera de gala'' consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a [[petticoat]]. Girls wear ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170518133519/http://panamafolktembleques.com/ tembleques]'' in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The ''pollera montuna'' is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000349/http://discoverytheater.org/education/guides/2010/Celebremos%20Panama!%20Resource%20Guide.pdf Celebremos Panama!].

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home, Gacy typically duped his victims into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]]. He then raped and tortured his captive before killing his victim by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]]. 26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home. Three others were buried elsewhere on his property, while his last four victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after serving 18 months of his sentence. His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. He remained on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] for 14 years, spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994. \n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything. He presents himself as a victim of circumstances and blames other people who are out to get him ... the patient attempts to assure a sympathetic response by depicting himself as being at the mercy of a hostile environment.\"''\n| source = Section of report detailing Gacy's 1968 psychiatric evaluation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}}\n| width = 30em\n}}\nOn August 30, 1968, Gacy persuaded one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, to [[assault|physically assault]] Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying against him at the upcoming trial. Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H. Stone 2019 pp. 196-203\">Michael H. Stone & Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death. When he heard the news, Gacy was said to have collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, and had to be supported by prison staff.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy requested supervised compassionate leave from prison to attend his father's funeral in Chicago, but his request was denied.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=92}}\n\n==Return to Chicago==\nGacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after serving 18 months of his 10-year sentence.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1986|p=47}} Two of the conditions of his probation were for Gacy to relocate to Chicago to live with his mother and to observe a 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[curfew]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} with the Iowa Board of Parole receiving regular updates as to his progress.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}}\n\nUpon his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane\u2014who picked him up from the prison upon release and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence\u2014that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram. On August 21,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=168}} Cram moved into his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was [[inebriated]]. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then informed him that he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the [[US Army|Army]], kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=172}} Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom. After this incident, Cram moved out of Gacy's home and subsequently left PDM Contractors, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19800213&id=slsxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=laQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1116,946568|title=The Montreal Gazette \u2013 Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref> Shortly after Cram had vacated Gacy's residence, another employee of PDM Contractors, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved into Gacy's house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=177}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=184}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=67}}{{efn|Rossi had worked for PDM Contractors since May 1976.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=58\u201360}} He lived with Gacy until April 1977.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=179}}}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.  In March 1977, Gacy was hired as a construction supervisor for PE Systems, a firm which specialized in the nationwide remodeling of drugstores. As a result of this contract, Gacy regularly traveled to other states to supervise construction projects and he later stated that, through both businesses (PDM Contractors and PE Systems), he often simultaneously worked on up to four construction projects,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} with almost 80 buildings being successfully remodeled in 1977 alone.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home.

Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring.

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone.

Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home, Gacy typically duped his victims into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]]. He then raped and tortured his captive before killing his victim by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]]. 26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home. Three others were buried elsewhere on his property, while his last four victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after serving 18 months of his sentence. His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. He remained on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] for 14 years, spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994. \n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram. On August 21,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=168}} Cram moved into his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was [[inebriated]]. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then informed him that he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the [[US Army|Army]], kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=172}} Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, the youth was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring.

It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|150px|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} He also confessed he had buried the body of John Butkovich in his garage.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=188}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired to construct this device, and to initially restrain his victims by tricking them into handcuffs, by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Given the gap of over four months between the dates of the murders of the first and second victims known to have been disposed in the river, it is possible that this unknown victim may have been killed between June and November 1978.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=220}}\n\nRetired Chicago police officer Bill Dorsch<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-30/news/chi-sheriff-wants-new-dig-for-gacy-victims-20120329_1_bill-dorsch-gacy-victims-west-miami-avenue/|title=Sheriff barred from digging for more Gacy victims|publisher=}}</ref> has stated he has reason to believe there may be more victims buried within the grounds of the apartment building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

It features collaborations with guest artists such as [[112 (band)|112]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mase]], [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], [[Too Short|Too $hort]], [[Angela Winbush]], [[Darryl McDaniels|D.M.C.]] of [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[R. Kelly]], [[The LOX]], and [[Puff Daddy]]. ''Life After Death'' exhibits The Notorious B.I.G. further delving into the [[mafioso rap]] subgenre. The album is a sequel to his first album, ''[[Ready to Die]]'', and picks up where the last song, \"Suicidal Thoughts\", ends.\n\nThe album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Solo Performance]] for its first single \"[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]\", and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for its second single \"[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]\" at the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards]]. In 2012, the album was ranked at No. 476 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/elvis-costello-and-the-attractions-armed-forces-44401/| year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nTwo and a half years before the album's release, the Notorious B.I.G. who had married [[Faith Evans]], became East Coast's icon in the East Coast{{endash}}West Coast rivalry and made guest appearances on albums by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Luther Campbell]] amongst others. The album was supposed to be released on [[Halloween]] in 1996, but was pushed back to 1997. Two weeks before its release, on March 9, the Notorious B.I.G. was shot four times in a drive-by shooting and was later pronounced dead at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles.\n\n== Feud references and subliminal disses ==\nConflict with other rappers is a major theme throughout the album. Numerous songs contain references to B.I.G.'s rivals, some subtle and some obvious.\n\n=== \"Kick in the Door\" ===\nThe track \"Kick in the Door\" is directed at [[Nas]], [[Jeru the Damaja]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]] and even the track's producer [[DJ Premier]]. The subtle messages have been speculated on by listeners and confirmed by artists on several occasions, including ''[[XXL Magazine|XXL]]'' magazine's April 2003 edition, \"The Making of: Life After Death\".\n\nIn \"The Making of: Life After Death\", Nashiem Myrick reveals that the second verse has lines directed at [[Jeru the Damaja]] and [[DJ Premier]]:<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=405 |title=The Making of Life After Death: Many Men |website=Xxlmag.Com |accessdate=February 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814024642/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=405 |archivedate=August 14, 2010 }}</ref> \"Nas said that record was for him, but when Big said, \"Son, I'm surprised you run with them/I think they got cum in them, 'cause they nothin' but dicks,\" he was talking about Jeru the Damaja to Premo 'cause Jeru was going at Big and Puff and all them [with the Premier-produced \"One Day\" in Jeru's album ''[[Wrath of the Math]]''].\"\n\nThe line \"Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye\" is a reference to Raekwon's jab on the track \"Ice Water\" from ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' where Raekwon raps.\n\n<blockquote>\nThat's life, to top it all off, beef with White<br />\npullin bleach out tryin to throw it in my eyesight<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe lines on the final verse are directed at Nas as a reference to Nas challenging The Notorious B.I.G. for the title of \"King of New York\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.king-mag.com/online/?p=5357 |title= KING Legacy: Nasir Jones, Part Two |website=KING-mag.com |date=May 1, 2008 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> in the song \"[[The Message (Nas song)|The Message]]\" from the album ''[[It Was Written]]'' in which Nas raps:\n\n<blockquote>\nYo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing<br />\nThere's one life, one love, so there can only be one King<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nBiggie struck back with the lines:\n\n<blockquote>\nAin't no other kings in this rap thing<br />\nThey siblings, nothing but my chil'ren<br />\nOne shot, they disappearin'<br />\nIt's ill when MC's used to be on cruddy shit<br />\nTook home ''[[Ready to Die]]'', listened, studied shit<br />\nNow they on some money shit, successful out the blue<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn \"The Making of: Life After Death\" article [[Lil' Cease]] explains, \"Big talked about Nas a little bit in that shit. It was the King of New York part, the last verse: \"This goes out for those that chose to use disrespectful views on the King of NY.\" That's when Nas had that freestyle out, where he was like, \"I'll take the crown off the so-called King and lock it down.\" That's when Big had the cover of The Source, and it said, \"The King of New York.\"\"<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\" />\n\n=== \"Long Kiss Goodnight\" ===\nIt was speculated by many listeners that the song \"Long Kiss Goodnight\" contains cryptic insults towards [[2Pac]] and [[Death Row Records]] CEO [[Suge Knight]], although at the time it was never confirmed due to the sensitive nature of both rappers' recent deaths.\n\nHowever, Lil' Cease, Biggie's cousin and a member of Junior M.A.F.I.A. claimed the following in ''XXL'' magazine's April 2003 issue about \"Long Kiss Goodnight\": \"That was about 'Pac. He had some shit at the beginning of that though, nobody heard it, on the reel. We had to change it. It was a little too much. I can't remember what Big said about him, but it was terrible. It couldn't make it. He didn't want to do it. He had some fire. But he didn't want to make it too much. He just wanted to address it and to let nigga know, \"I know what's going on, and I could get wreck if I want to.\" Like, \"If I really wanted to get on ya niggas, I could.\"\"\n\n[[P Diddy|Sean Combs]], however, denies these claims stating, \"Naw, it was just some emcee lyrics. I know people wanna have their imagination, but it was just lyrics. You're hearing it from the horse's mouth. I would tell the truth.\"<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\" />\n\nIn the first verse, the lyric \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\" is allegedly a reference to two tattoos on 2Pac's back.<ref name=\"rapgenius.com\">{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/lyrics/The-notorious-b-i-g/Long-kiss-goodnight |title=The Notorious B.I.G. \u2013 Long Kiss Goodnight Lyrics |website=Rap Genius |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\nA line in the first verse is supposedly aimed at Shakur:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen my men bust you just move with such stamina<br />\nSlugs missed ya, [[I Ain't Mad at Cha]] (We Ain't Mad at Cha)<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe last two verses in particular seem to be directed towards Tupac:\n\n<blockquote>\nI'm flaming gats, aimin' at these fuckin' maniacs<br />\nPut my name in raps, what part the game is that?<br />\nLike they hustle backwards<br />\nI smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, ya can't touch me<br />\nTry to rush me, slugs go touchy-touchy<br />\nYou're bleeding lovely with your spirit above me or beneath me<br />\nYour whole life you live sneaky<br />\nNow you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me<br />\nRest where the worms and the weak be<br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nSlugs hit your chest, tap your spine, flat line<br />\nHeard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times<br />\nDamn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though<br />\nSlugs still slow, as for remorse, we feel no<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe lines seem to be making reference to Tupac frequently mentioning Biggie ''by name'' in his raps, and allegations spread by [[Wendy Williams]] that he had been raped during his prison term at [[Rikers Island]].<ref name=\"rapgenius.com\" />\nAlthough some fans have interpreted these lines as references to Shakur's murder, XXL Magazine wrote that the song was most likely recorded before 2Pac's death.<ref>{{cite

|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Other references ===\nIn \"Going Back to Cali\" the second verse opens up with Biggie's thoughts on the inter-coastal war and his relationship with the West Coast:\n<blockquote>\nIf I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East<br />\nI live out there, so don't go there<br />\nBut that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West<br />\nSee some nice breasts in the West<br />\nSmoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess<br />\nThinkin' I'm gon' stop, givin' L.A. props<br />\nAll I got is beef with those that violate me<br />\nI shall annihilate thee<br />\nCase closed\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the song \"[[Notorious Thugs]]\", B.I.G. clearly refers to longtime nemesis [[2Pac]] in the line \"so called beef with you-know-who\", calling the feud between him and Shakur 'bullshit', while [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]] (who featured 2Pac on one of their songs the same year) throw jabs at [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Twista]], [[Crucial Conflict]] and [[Do or Die (group)|Do or Die]].\n\nThe tracks \"What's Beef\" and \"My Downfall\", both of which deal with the subject of feuding, as well as \"Last Day\" and \"You're Nobody (Till Somebody Kills You)\" are also said to contain apparent jabs aimed at his rivals (including Shakur), even though Biggie stated in a ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'' magazine interview that the song \"You're Nobody (Till Somebody Kills You)\" was not directed at Shakur, who at the time had recently been shot.<ref>{{cite

[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the album as \"flaunting affluence with a leisurely swagger, midtempo grooves and calmly arrogant raps\".<ref name=\"Pareles\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/30/arts/swaggering-in-death-s-face-till-the-end.html |title=Swaggering in Death's Face Till the End |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 30, 1997 |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |last=Pareles |first=Jon |authorlink=Jon Pareles}}</ref> [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine called it a \"conscious continuation of ''[[Ready to Die]]''\", and stated \"''Life After Death'' captures crime's undeniable glamour but doesn't stint on the fear, desperation and irretrievable loss that the streets inevitably exact\".<ref name=\"DeCurtis\" /> [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \"''Life After Death'' reflects both the dark and the heartfelt sides of the rapper's [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] personality. It's not only a complex testament to who he was in his private life, but also a demonstration of his amazing rhyming ability. In key moments, B.I.G. does a marvelous job of surfing between accessible music fare tailored for the radio, and more challenging material that will be savored by hard-core rap fans who have long admired B.I.G.'s microphone skills. Rarely has a rapper attempted to please so many different audiences and done it so brilliantly\".<ref name=\"Coker\" /> In a [[The Source#The Source's Five-Mic albums|five-mic]] review for ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'', Michael A.

[[Rob Sheffield]], writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), called it \"a [[filler (media)|filler]]-free two-disc rush of musical bravado\" and commented that the Notorious B.I.G.'s voice and lyrics were \"deeper\" than before.<ref name=\"Hoard\" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier wrote, \"It may have taken the Notorious B.I.G. a few years to follow up his milestone debut, ''Ready to Die'', with another album, but when he did return with ''Life After Death'', he did so in a huge way. The ambitious album, intended as somewhat of a sequel to ''Ready to Die'', picked up where its predecessor left off.\"<ref name=\"Birchmeier\" /> Birchmeier further said, \"Over the course of only two albums, he achieved every success imaginable, perhaps none greater than this unabashedly over-reaching success.\"<ref name=\"Birchmeier\" /> Evan McGarvey of ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' magazine wrote in his review, \"''Life After Death'' is a grand exercise in personal mythology, narrative sweep, and truly diverse, universal pop excellence. As a double album it is the very definition of cinematic; it essentially perfected the concept and standard in hip-hop&nbsp;... Sequenced as an unpacking of sorts, the album's progression from song to song is an essay itself.\"<ref name=\"McGarvey\">McGarvey, Evan (September 11, 2007).

After the release of ''Life After Death'', [[Puff Daddy]]'s [[Bad Boy Records]] continued to bring pop and gangsta rap closer together: the references to violence and drug dealing remained, as did the entire \"gangsta\" rhetoric, but the overall production style changed from the previously darker sound to a cleaner, [[Sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy, more upbeat sound that was directly fashioned for the mainstream pop charts, as seen in the single \"[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]\". The Notorious B.I.G. is often credited with initiating this transition, as he was among the first mainstream rappers to produce albums with a calculated attempt to include both gritty and realistic gangsta narratives as well as more radio-friendly productions. The majority of the album was produced by [[Stevie J|Steven \"Stevie J\" Jordan]], [[Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie]], Carlos \"July Six\" Broady, [[Ron \"Amen-Ra\" Lawrence|Ron Lawrence]], and Nashiem Myrick. However, other notable hip-hop producers such as [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]] from [[Mobb Deep]], [[DJ Premier]] and [[RZA]] from [[Wu-Tang Clan]] contributed beats to the album as well.\n\nVarious artists were specifically influenced by songs on ''Life After Death''. [[Evidence (artist)|Evidence]]'s \"Down in New York City\" is essentially \"Going Back to Cali\" from the perspective of a [[West Coast hip hop]] artist. [[Jay-Z]] borrows four bars from \"The World Is Filled...\" in his song \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\", as well as the chorus from his song \"Squeeze 1st\" from \"[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]\", a line in \"The Ruler's Back\" from \"Kick in the Door\" and \"You're Nobody ('Til Somebody Kills You)\" on \"[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)]]\". [[Ice Cube]] borrows the chorus from \"Kick in the Door\" for his song \"Child Support\". As with B.I.G.'s \"I Love The Dough\" [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]]'s 2010 song \"[[Everything to Me (Monica song)|Everything to Me]]\" samples \"I Love You More\" by [[Ren\u00e9 & Angela]]. The official remix includes a verse from B.I.G. that originally appeared on \"I Love The Dough\". [[SWV]] sampled \"Ten Crack Commandments\" on the opening track \"Someone\" featuring B.I.G.'s former protege and friend [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]. The French rapper [[Rohff]] named his album \"La Vie Avant La Mort\" (Life Before Death) (2001) as a tribute to B.I.G, [[Joey Badass]] interpolated the lines 'Kick in the Door' on \"Super Predator\" from ''[[All-Amerikkkan Badass]]'' (2017). The album has sold 350,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits adapted from ''Life After Death'' liner notes.<ref name=\"booklet\">[http://www.rapmusicguide.com/item/11184/Notorious_B.I.G._Life_After_Death.html Notorious B.I.G. \u2013 Life After Death: 1st Press.

It features collaborations with guest artists such as [[112 (band)|112]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mase]], [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], [[Too Short|Too $hort]], [[Angela Winbush]], [[Darryl McDaniels|D.M.C.]] of [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[R. Kelly]], [[The LOX]], and [[Puff Daddy]]. ''Life After Death'' exhibits The Notorious B.I.G. further delving into the [[mafioso rap]] subgenre. The album is a sequel to his first album, ''[[Ready to Die]]'', and picks up where the last song, \"Suicidal Thoughts\", ends.\n\nThe album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Solo Performance]] for its first single \"[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]\", and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for its second single \"[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]\" at the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards]].

The album was supposed to be released on [[Halloween]] in 1996, but was pushed back to 1997. Two weeks before its release, on March 9, the Notorious B.I.G. was shot four times in a drive-by shooting and was later pronounced dead at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles.\n\n== Feud references and subliminal disses ==\nConflict with other rappers is a major theme throughout the album. Numerous songs contain references to B.I.G.'s rivals, some subtle and some obvious.\n\n=== \"Kick in the Door\" ===\nThe track \"Kick in the Door\" is directed at [[Nas]], [[Jeru the Damaja]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]] and even the track's producer [[DJ Premier]]. The subtle messages have been speculated on by listeners and confirmed by artists on several occasions, including ''[[XXL Magazine|XXL]]'' magazine's April 2003 edition, \"The Making of: Life After Death\".\n\nIn \"The Making of: Life After Death\", Nashiem Myrick reveals that the second verse has lines directed at [[Jeru the Damaja]] and [[DJ Premier]]:<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=405 |title=The Making of Life After Death: Many Men |website=Xxlmag.Com |accessdate=February 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814024642/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=405 |archivedate=August 14, 2010 }}</ref> \"Nas said that record was for him, but when Big said, \"Son, I'm surprised you run with them/I think they got cum in them, 'cause they nothin' but dicks,\" he was talking about Jeru the Damaja to Premo 'cause Jeru was going at Big and Puff and all them [with the Premier-produced \"One Day\" in Jeru's album ''[[Wrath of the Math]]''].\"\n\nThe line \"Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye\" is a reference to Raekwon's jab on the track \"Ice Water\" from ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' where Raekwon raps.\n\n<blockquote>\nThat's life, to top it all off, beef with White<br />\npullin bleach out tryin to throw it in my eyesight<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe lines on the final verse are directed at Nas as a reference to Nas challenging The Notorious B.I.G. for the title of \"King of New York\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.king-mag.com/online/?p=5357 |title= KING Legacy: Nasir Jones, Part Two |website=KING-mag.com |date=May 1, 2008 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> in the song \"[[The Message (Nas song)|The Message]]\" from the album ''[[It Was Written]]'' in which Nas raps:\n\n<blockquote>\nYo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing<br />\nThere's one life, one love, so there can only be one King<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nBiggie struck back with the lines:\n\n<blockquote>\nAin't no other kings in this rap thing<br />\nThey siblings, nothing but my chil'ren<br />\nOne shot, they disappearin'<br />\nIt's ill when MC's used to be on cruddy shit<br />\nTook home ''[[Ready to Die]]'', listened, studied shit<br />\nNow they on some money shit, successful out the blue<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIn \"The Making of: Life After Death\" article [[Lil' Cease]] explains, \"Big talked about Nas a little bit in that shit. It was the King of New York part, the last verse: \"This goes out for those that chose to use disrespectful views on the King of NY.\" That's when Nas had that freestyle out, where he was like, \"I'll take the crown off the so-called King and lock it down.\" That's when Big had the cover of The Source, and it said, \"The King of New York.\"\"<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\" />\n\n=== \"Long Kiss Goodnight\" ===\nIt was speculated by many listeners that the song \"Long Kiss Goodnight\" contains cryptic insults towards [[2Pac]] and [[Death Row Records]] CEO [[Suge Knight]], although at the time it was never confirmed due to the sensitive nature of both rappers' recent deaths.\n\nHowever, Lil' Cease, Biggie's cousin and a member of Junior M.A.F.I.A. claimed the following in ''XXL'' magazine's April 2003 issue about \"Long Kiss Goodnight\": \"That was about 'Pac. He had some shit at the beginning of that though, nobody heard it, on the reel. We had to change it. It was a little too much. I can't remember what Big said about him, but it was terrible. It couldn't make it. He didn't want to do it. He had some fire. But he didn't want to make it too much. He just wanted to address it and to let nigga know, \"I know what's going on, and I could get wreck if I want to.\" Like, \"If I really wanted to get on ya niggas, I could.\"\"\n\n[[P Diddy|Sean Combs]], however, denies these claims stating, \"Naw, it was just some emcee lyrics. I know people wanna have their imagination, but it was just lyrics. You're hearing it from the horse's mouth. I would tell the truth.\"<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\" />\n\nIn the first verse, the lyric \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\" is allegedly a reference to two tattoos on 2Pac's back.<ref name=\"rapgenius.com\">{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/lyrics/The-notorious-b-i-g/Long-kiss-goodnight |title=The Notorious B.I.G. \u2013 Long Kiss Goodnight Lyrics |website=Rap Genius |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\nA line in the first verse is supposedly aimed at Shakur:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen my men bust you just move with such stamina<br />\nSlugs missed ya, [[I Ain't Mad at Cha]] (We Ain't Mad at Cha)<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe last two verses in particular seem to be directed towards Tupac:\n\n<blockquote>\nI'm flaming gats, aimin' at these fuckin' maniacs<br />\nPut my name in raps, what part the game is that?<br />\nLike they hustle backwards<br />\nI smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, ya can't touch me<br />\nTry to rush me, slugs go touchy-touchy<br />\nYou're bleeding lovely with your spirit above me or beneath me<br />\nYour whole life you live sneaky<br />\nNow you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me<br />\nRest where the worms and the weak be<br />\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nSlugs hit your chest, tap your spine, flat line<br />\nHeard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times<br />\nDamn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though<br />\nSlugs still slow, as for remorse, we feel no<br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe lines seem to be making reference to Tupac frequently mentioning Biggie ''by name'' in his raps, and allegations spread by [[Wendy Williams]] that he had been raped during his prison term at [[Rikers Island]].<ref name=\"rapgenius.com\" />\nAlthough some fans have interpreted these lines as references to Shakur's murder, XXL Magazine wrote that the song was most likely recorded before 2Pac's death.<ref>{{cite

|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Other references ===\nIn \"Going Back to Cali\" the second verse opens up with Biggie's thoughts on the inter-coastal war and his relationship with the West Coast:\n<blockquote>\nIf I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East<br />\nI live out there, so don't go there<br />\nBut that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West<br />\nSee some nice breasts in the West<br />\nSmoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess<br />\nThinkin' I'm gon' stop, givin' L.A. props<br />\nAll I got is beef with those that violate me<br />\nI shall annihilate thee<br />\nCase closed\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the song \"[[Notorious Thugs]]\", B.I.G. clearly refers to longtime nemesis [[2Pac]] in the line \"so called beef with you-know-who\", calling the feud between him and Shakur 'bullshit', while [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]] (who featured 2Pac on one of their songs the same year) throw jabs at [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Twista]], [[Crucial Conflict]] and [[Do or Die (group)|Do or Die]].\n\nThe tracks \"What's Beef\" and \"My Downfall\", both of which deal with the subject of feuding, as well as \"Last Day\" and \"You're Nobody (Till Somebody Kills You)\" are also said to contain apparent jabs aimed at his rivals (including Shakur), even though Biggie stated in a ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'' magazine interview that the song \"You're Nobody (Till Somebody Kills You)\" was not directed at Shakur, who at the time had recently been shot.<ref>{{cite

[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the album as \"flaunting affluence with a leisurely swagger, midtempo grooves and calmly arrogant raps\".<ref name=\"Pareles\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/30/arts/swaggering-in-death-s-face-till-the-end.html |title=Swaggering in Death's Face Till the End |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 30, 1997 |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |last=Pareles |first=Jon |authorlink=Jon Pareles}}</ref> [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine called it a \"conscious continuation of ''[[Ready to Die]]''\", and stated \"''Life After Death'' captures crime's undeniable glamour but doesn't stint on the fear, desperation and irretrievable loss that the streets inevitably exact\".<ref name=\"DeCurtis\" /> [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \"''Life After Death'' reflects both the dark and the heartfelt sides of the rapper's [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] personality. It's not only a complex testament to who he was in his private life, but also a demonstration of his amazing rhyming ability. In key moments, B.I.G. does a marvelous job of surfing between accessible music fare tailored for the radio, and more challenging material that will be savored by hard-core rap fans who have long admired B.I.G.'s microphone skills.

[[Rob Sheffield]], writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), called it \"a [[filler (media)|filler]]-free two-disc rush of musical bravado\" and commented that the Notorious B.I.G.'s voice and lyrics were \"deeper\" than before.<ref name=\"Hoard\" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier wrote, \"It may have taken the Notorious B.I.G. a few years to follow up his milestone debut, ''Ready to Die'', with another album, but when he did return with ''Life After Death'', he did so in a huge way. The ambitious album, intended as somewhat of a sequel to ''Ready to Die'', picked up where its predecessor left off.\"<ref name=\"Birchmeier\" /> Birchmeier further said, \"Over the course of only two albums, he achieved every success imaginable, perhaps none greater than this unabashedly over-reaching success.\"<ref name=\"Birchmeier\" /> Evan McGarvey of ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' magazine wrote in his review, \"''Life After Death'' is a grand exercise in personal mythology, narrative sweep, and truly diverse, universal pop excellence.

After the release of ''Life After Death'', [[Puff Daddy]]'s [[Bad Boy Records]] continued to bring pop and gangsta rap closer together: the references to violence and drug dealing remained, as did the entire \"gangsta\" rhetoric, but the overall production style changed from the previously darker sound to a cleaner, [[Sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy, more upbeat sound that was directly fashioned for the mainstream pop charts, as seen in the single \"[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]\". The Notorious B.I.G. is often credited with initiating this transition, as he was among the first mainstream rappers to produce albums with a calculated attempt to include both gritty and realistic gangsta narratives as well as more radio-friendly productions. The majority of the album was produced by [[Stevie J|Steven \"Stevie J\" Jordan]], [[Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie]], Carlos \"July Six\" Broady, [[Ron \"Amen-Ra\" Lawrence|Ron Lawrence]], and Nashiem Myrick. However, other notable hip-hop producers such as [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]] from [[Mobb Deep]], [[DJ Premier]] and [[RZA]] from [[Wu-Tang Clan]] contributed beats to the album as well.\n\nVarious artists were specifically influenced by songs on ''Life After Death''. [[Evidence (artist)|Evidence]]'s \"Down in New York City\" is essentially \"Going Back to Cali\" from the perspective of a [[West Coast hip hop]] artist. [[Jay-Z]] borrows four bars from \"The World Is Filled...\" in his song \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\", as well as the chorus from his song \"Squeeze 1st\" from \"[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]\", a line in \"The Ruler's Back\" from \"Kick in the Door\" and \"You're Nobody ('Til Somebody Kills You)\" on \"[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)]]\". [[Ice Cube]] borrows the chorus from \"Kick in the Door\" for his song \"Child Support\". As with B.I.G.'s \"I Love The Dough\" [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]]'s 2010 song \"[[Everything to Me (Monica song)|Everything to Me]]\" samples \"I Love You More\" by [[Ren\u00e9 & Angela]]. The official remix includes a verse from B.I.G. that originally appeared on \"I Love The Dough\". [[SWV]] sampled \"Ten Crack Commandments\" on the opening track \"Someone\" featuring B.I.G.'s former protege and friend [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]. The French rapper [[Rohff]] named his album \"La Vie Avant La Mort\" (Life Before Death) (2001) as a tribute to B.I.G, [[Joey Badass]] interpolated the lines 'Kick in the Door' on \"Super Predator\" from ''[[All-Amerikkkan Badass]]'' (2017). The album has sold 350,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits adapted from ''Life After Death'' liner notes.<ref name=\"booklet\">[http://www.rapmusicguide.com/item/11184/Notorious_B.I.G._Life_After_Death.html Notorious B.I.G. \u2013 Life After Death: 1st Press.

He is considered the most influential artist of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] tradition. Rubens's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.\n\nIn addition to running a large studio in [[Antwerp]] that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholar]] and diplomat who was [[knight]]ed by both [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Charles I of England]]. Rubens was a prolific artist. The catalogue of his works by [[Michael Jaff\u00e9]] lists 1,403 pieces, excluding numerous copies made in his workshop.<ref>[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/1979/153/1/doctoraat.pdf Nico Van Hout, 1979]</ref> The [[Museo del Prado]] owns the largest collection of Rubens' paintings, and one of the finest as well, and almost all of it comes from Spain's royal collections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/artist/rubens-peter-paul/099c7adf-d261-4e54-8a3b-7807500ca539|title=Rubens, Peter Paul - The Collection - Museo Nacional del Prado|website=www.museodelprado.es|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis commissioned works were mostly [[history painting]]s, which included religious and mythological subjects, and hunt scenes. He painted portraits, especially of friends, and self-portraits, and in later life painted several landscapes. Rubens designed tapestries and prints, as well as his own house. He also oversaw the [[ephemeral]] decorations of the [[royal entry]] into Antwerp by the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]] in 1635.\n\nHe was one of the last major artists to make consistent use of [[panel painting|wooden panels]] as a support medium, even for substantial works, but he used [[canvas]] as well, especially when the work needed to be sent a long distance. For [[altarpiece]]s he sometimes painted on [[slate]] to reduce reflection problems.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens (statue).JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp by [[Guillaume Geefs]]]]\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:GARDENS IN THE RUBENS HOUSE - ANTWERP.jpg|thumb|The garden designed by Rubens at the [[Rubenshuis]] in [[Antwerpen]]]]\n\nRubens was born in the city of [[Siegen]] to [[Jan Rubens]] and [[Maria Pypelincks]]. He was named in honour of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]], because he was born on [[Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul|their solemnity]].<ref>Historische levensbeschryving van P.P. Rubens Door Jean Francois Marie Michel. p.14</ref> His father, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and mother fled Antwerp for [[Cologne]] in 1568, after increased religious turmoil and persecution of [[Protestant]]s during the rule of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] by [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd&nbsp;Duke of Alba|the Duke of Alba]]. Rubens was baptised in Cologne at [[St Peter's Church (Cologne)|St Peter's Church]].\n\nJan Rubens became the legal adviser (and lover) of [[Anna of Saxony]], the second wife of [[William the Silent|William&nbsp;I of Orange]], and settled at her court in Siegen in 1570, fathering her daughter Christine who was born in 1571.<ref>H.

Retrieved 2 February 2013.</ref>\n\nFollowing Jan Rubens's imprisonment for the affair, Peter Paul Rubens was born in 1577. The family returned to Cologne the next year. In 1589, two years after his father's death, Rubens moved with his mother Maria Pypelincks to Antwerp, where he was raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].\n\nReligion figured prominently in much of his work, and Rubens later became one of the leading voices of the Catholic Counter-Reformation style of painting<ref>Belkin (1998): 11\u201318.</ref> (he had said \"My passion comes from the heavens, not from earthly musings\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Apprenticeship ===\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Possibly an Architect or Geographer MET DT8854.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of a Young Scholar'', from 1597]]\n\nIn Antwerp, Rubens received a [[Renaissance humanist]] education, studying Latin and classical literature. By fourteen, he began his artistic apprenticeship with [[Tobias Verhaeght]]. Subsequently, he studied under two of the city's leading painters of the time, the late [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists [[Adam van Noort]] and [[Otto van Veen]].<ref>Held (1983): 14\u201335.</ref> Much of his earliest training involved copying earlier artists' works, such as [[woodcut]]s by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s [[engraving]]s after [[Raphael]]. Rubens completed his education in 1598, at which time he entered the [[Guild of St. Luke]] as an independent master.<ref>Belkin (1998): 22\u201338.</ref>\n\n=== Italy (1600\u20131608) ===\nIn 1600 Rubens travelled to Italy. He stopped first in [[Venice]], where he saw paintings by [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and [[Tintoretto]], before settling in [[Mantua]] at the court of Duke [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Vincenzo&nbsp;I Gonzaga]]. The colouring and compositions of [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and Tintoretto had an immediate effect on Rubens's painting, and his later, mature style was profoundly influenced by [[Titian]].<ref>Belkin (1998): 42; 57.</ref> With financial support from the Duke, Rubens travelled to [[Rome]] by way of [[Florence]] in 1601. There, he studied classical Greek and Roman art and copied works of the Italian masters.  The [[Hellenistic]] sculpture ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]'' was especially influential on him, as was the art of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>Belkin (1998): 52\u201357</ref> He was also influenced by the recent, highly naturalistic paintings by [[Caravaggio]].\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Fall of Phaeton (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''[[The Fall of Phaeton (Rubens)|The Fall of Phaeton]]'', 1604, in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nRubens later made a copy of Caravaggio's ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'' and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|''The Death of the Virgin'']] ([[Louvre]]).<ref>Belkin (1998): 59.</ref> After his return to Antwerp, he was instrumental in the acquisition of [[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|''The Madonna of the Rosary'']] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]]) for the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp.<ref>Sirjacobs, Raymond.

This journey marked the first of many during his career that combined art and diplomacy.\n\nHe returned to Italy in 1604, where he remained for the next four years, first in Mantua and then in [[Genoa]] and Rome. In Genoa, Rubens painted numerous portraits, such as the ''[[:File:Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria.jpg|Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria]]'' (National Gallery of Art, Washington,&nbsp;D.C.), and the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra Pallavicini, in a style that influenced later paintings by [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]].<ref>Belkin (1998): 75.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rubens Madonna on Floral Wreath.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Madonna on Floral Wreath'', together with Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1619]]\n\nHe also began a book illustrating the palaces in the city, which was published in 1622 as ''[[Palazzi di Genova]]''. From 1606 to 1608, he was mostly in Rome. During this period Rubens received, with the assistance of Cardinal Jacopo Serra (the brother of Maria Pallavicini), his most important commission to date for the High Altar of the city's most fashionable new church, [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] also known as the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].\n\nThe subject was to be [[St. Gregory the Great|St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great]] and important local saints adoring an [[icon]] of the Virgin and Child. The first version, a single canvas (now at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble), was immediately replaced by a second version on three slate panels that permits the actual miraculous holy image of the \"Santa Maria in Vallicella\" to be revealed on important feast days by a removable copper cover, also painted by the artist.<ref>Jaff\u00e9 (1977): 85\u201399; Belting (1994): 484\u201390, 554\u201356.</ref>\n\nRubens's experiences in Italy continued to influence his work. He continued to write many of his letters and correspondences in Italian, signed his name as \"Pietro Paolo Rubens,\" and spoke longingly of returning to the peninsula\u2014a hope that never materialized.<ref>Belkin (1998): 95.</ref>\n\n=== Antwerp (1609\u20131621) ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens Peter Paul Rubens - The Artist and His First Wife, Isabella Brant, in the Honeysuckle Bower.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rubens and [[Isabella Brandt]], the [[Honeysuckle Bower]]'', c. 1609. [[Alte Pinakothek]]]]\n\nUpon hearing of his mother's illness in 1608, Rubens planned his departure from Italy for Antwerp. However, she died before he arrived home. His return coincided with a period of renewed prosperity in the city with the signing of the [[Treaty of Antwerp (1609)|Treaty of Antwerp]] in April 1609, which initiated the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. In September 1609, Rubens was appointed as court painter by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], sovereigns of the [[Low Countries]].\n\nHe received special permission to base his studio in Antwerp instead of at their court in [[Brussels]], and to also work for other clients. He remained close to Archduchess Isabella until she died in 1633, and was called upon not only as a painter but also as an ambassador and diplomat. Rubens further cemented his ties to the city when, on 3 October 1609, he married [[Isabella Brant]], the daughter of a leading Antwerp citizen and humanist, Jan Brant.\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Descent from the Cross - WGA20230.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', 1618. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]\n\nIn 1610 Rubens moved into a new house and studio that he designed. Now the [[Rubenshuis]] Museum, the Italian-influenced villa in the centre of Antwerp accommodated his workshop, where he and his apprentices made most of the paintings, and his art collection and library, both among the most extensive in Antwerp. During this time, he built up a studio with numerous students and assistants. His most famous pupil was the young [[Anthony van Dyck]], who soon became the leading Flemish portraitist and frequently collaborated with Rubens. He also often worked with the many specialists active in the city, including the animal painter [[Frans Snyders]], who contributed the eagle to ''[[Prometheus Bound (Rubens)|Prometheus Bound]]'' (c. 1611\u201312, completed by 1618), and his good friend the flower-painter [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]].\n\nRubens built another house to the north of Antwerp in the [[polder]] village of [[Doel]], \"Hooghuis\" (1613/1643), perhaps as an investment. The \"High House\" was built next to the village church.\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens -Familie van Jan Bruegel de Oude - Courtauld Gallery Londen 2-12-2009 16-35-20.JPG|thumb|upright|''Family of Jan Brueghel the Elder'', 1613\u20131615. [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] ]]\n\nAltarpieces such as ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'' (1610) and ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (1611\u20131614) for the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|Cathedral of Our Lady]] were particularly important in establishing Rubens as Flanders' leading painter shortly after his return. ''The Raising of the Cross'', for example, demonstrates the artist's synthesis of [[:File:Jacopo Tintoretto 021.jpg|Tintoretto's ''Crucifixion'']] for the [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] in Venice, [[Michelangelo]]'s dynamic figures, and Rubens's style. This painting has been held as a prime example of Baroque religious art.<ref>Martin (1977): 109.</ref>\n\nRubens used the production of [[Old master print|prints]] and book title-pages, especially for his friend [[Balthasar Moretus]], the owner of the large [[Plantin Press|Plantin-Moretus publishing house]], to extend his fame throughout Europe during this part of his career. In 1618, Rubens embarked upon a printmaking enterprise by soliciting an unusual triple privilege (an early form of [[copyright]]) to protect his designs in France, the Southern Netherlands, and United Provinces.<ref name=Hottle>{{cite journal|journal=Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek|last=Hottle|first=Andrew D.|title=Commerce and Connections: Peter Paul Rubens and the Dedicated Print|volume=55|year=2004|pages=54\u201385}}</ref> He enlisted [[Lucas Vorsterman]] to engrave a number of his notable religious and mythological paintings, to which Rubens appended personal and professional dedications to noteworthy individuals in the Southern Netherlands, United Provinces, England, France, and Spain.<ref name=Hottle/> except for a few [[etching]]s, Rubens left the [[printmaking]] to specialists, who included Lucas Vorsterman, [[Paulus Pontius]] and [[Willem Panneels]].<ref>Pauw-De Veen (1977): 243\u2013251.</ref> He recruited several engravers trained by [[Christoffel Jegher]], whom he carefully schooled in the more vigorous style he wanted.

The [[Marie de' Medici cycle]] (now in the Louvre) was installed in 1625, and although he began work on the second series it was never completed.<ref>Belkin (1998): 175; 192; Held (1975): 218\u2013233, esp. pp. 222\u2013225.</ref> Marie was exiled from France in 1630 by her son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], and died in 1642 in the same house in Cologne where Rubens had lived as a child.<ref>Belkin (1998): 173\u2013175.</ref>\n\n[[File:Anna of Austria by Rubens (1622-1625, Norton Simon Museum).jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of [[Anne of Austria|Anna of Austria]]'', Queen of France, c. 1622\u20131625]]\n\nAfter the end of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621, the Spanish [[Habsburg]] rulers entrusted Rubens with several diplomatic missions.<ref name=\"peace\">Belkin (1998): 199\u2013228.</ref> While in Paris in 1622 to discuss the Marie de' Medici cycle, Rubens engaged in clandestine information gathering activities, which at the time was an important task of diplomats.  He relied on his friendship with [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] to get information on political developments in France.<ref>Auwers: p. 25.</ref>  Between 1627 and 1630, Rubens's diplomatic career was particularly active, and he moved between the courts of Spain and England in an attempt to bring peace between the Spanish Netherlands and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  He also made several trips to the northern Netherlands as both an artist and a diplomat.\n\nAt the courts, he sometimes encountered the attitude that courtiers should not use their hands in any art or trade, but he was also received as a gentleman by many.  Rubens was raised by Philip&nbsp;IV of Spain, to the nobility in 1624 and knighted by Charles I of England in 1630.  Philip IV confirmed Rubens's status as a knight a few months later.<ref>Auwers: p. 32.</ref>  Rubens was awarded an honorary [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree from [[Cambridge University]] in 1629.<ref>Belkin (1998): 339\u2013340</ref>\n\nRubens was in Madrid for eight months in 1628\u20131629. In addition to diplomatic negotiations, he executed several important works for Philip&nbsp;IV, and private patrons. He also began a renewed study of Titian's paintings, copying numerous works including the Madrid ''Fall of Man'' (1628\u201329).<ref>Belkin (1998): 210\u2013218.</ref> During this stay, he befriended the court painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and the two planned to travel to Italy together the following year.

Prado, Madrid]]\n\nHis stay in Antwerp was brief, and he soon travelled on to London, where he remained until April 1630. An important work from this period is the ''Allegory of Peace and War'' (1629; [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng46 |title=Minerva protects Pax from Mars ('Peace and War') |accessdate=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531113432/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG46 |archivedate=31 May 2009  }}</ref> It illustrates the artist's lively concern for peace, and was given to Charles I as a gift.\n\nWhile Rubens's international reputation with collectors and nobility abroad continued to grow during this decade, he and his workshop also continued to paint monumental paintings for local patrons in Antwerp. The ''[[Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Rubens)|Assumption of the Virgin Mary]]'' (1625\u20136) for the Cathedral of Antwerp is one prominent example.\n\n=== Last decade (1630\u20131640) ===\nRubens's last decade was spent in and around Antwerp. Major works for foreign patrons still occupied him, such as the ceiling paintings for the [[Banqueting House at Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Inigo Jones]]'s [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Still, he also explored more personal artistic directions.\n\nIn 1630, four years after the death of his first wife Isabella, the 53-year-old painter married his first wife's niece, the 16-year-old [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment]]. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne inspired the voluptuous figures in many of his paintings from the 1630s, including ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 117.jpg|The Feast of Venus]]'' (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 026.jpg|The Three Graces]]'' and ''[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|The Judgment of Paris]]'' (both Prado, Madrid). In the latter painting, which was made for the Spanish court, the artist's young wife was recognized by viewers in the figure of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. In an intimate portrait of her, ''H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment in a Fur Wrap'', also known as ''[[Het Pelsken]]'', Rubens's wife is even partially modelled after classical sculptures of the [[Venus Pudica]], such as the [[Venus de' Medici|Medici Venus]].\n\nIn 1635, Rubens bought an estate outside Antwerp, the [[Elewijt Castle|Steen]], where he spent much of his time. Landscapes, such as his ''[[Ch\u00e2teau de Steen with Hunter]]'' (National Gallery, London) and ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 102.jpg|Farmers Returning from the Fields]]'' (Pitti Gallery, Florence), reflect the more personal nature of many of his later works. He also drew upon the Netherlandish traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] for inspiration in later works like ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 014.jpg|Flemish Kermis]]'' (c.&nbsp;1630; Louvre, Paris).\n\n=== Death ===\nRubens died from heart failure, a result of his chronic [[gout]], on 30 May 1640. He was interred in [[Saint James' Church, Antwerp]]. His epitaph read:<ref>Antwerpen \u2013 Parochiekerken; 1.

Painted in the Baroque tradition of depicting women as soft-bodied, passive, and highly sexualized beings, his nudes emphasize the concepts of fertility, desire, physical beauty, temptation, and virtue. Skillfully rendered, these paintings of nude women were undoubtedly created to appeal to his largely male audience of patrons.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=431556|title=Review on JSTOR}}</ref> Additionally, Rubens was quite fond of painting full-figured women, giving rise to terms like 'Rubensian' or 'Rubenesque' (sometimes 'Rubensesque').

His male nudes represent highly athletic and large mythical or biblical men. Unlike his female nudes, most of his male nudes are depicted partially nude, with sashes, armour, or shadows shielding them from being completely unclothed. These men are twisting, reaching, bending, and grasping: all of which portray his male subjects engaged in a great deal of physical, sometimes aggressive, action. The concepts Rubens artistically represents illustrate the male as powerful, capable, forceful, and compelling. The allegorical and symbolic subjects he painted reference the classic masculine tropes of athleticism, high achievement, valour in war, and civil authority.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Male archetypes readily found in Rubens's paintings include the hero, husband, father, civic leader, king, and the battle-weary.\n\nRubens was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci's work. Using an engraving done 50 years after Leonardo started his project on the Battle of Anghiari, Rubens did a masterly drawing of the Battle, which is now in the Louvre in Paris. \"The idea that an ancient copy of a lost artwork can be as important as the original is familiar to scholars,\" says Salvatore Settis, archaeologist and art historian.\n\n<!-- [[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Deborah Kip and her Children - WGA20381.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| ]] -->\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\" perrow=\"8\">\nFile:KMSKB-2011 - interior 3.jpg|Peter Paul Rubens works at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, Brussels, Belgium\nFile:0 Ixion roi des Laphites tromp\u00e9 par Junon qu\u2019il voulait s\u00e9duire - Pierre Paul Rubens (1).JPG|Peter Paul Rubens work at the Louvre\nFile:Rubens painting in front of the speaker table at a Wikipedia workshop.JPG|Peter Paul Rubens works at the [[Victor Balaguer Museum]]\nFile:Angel Garcia de Diego Museo del Prado Duque de Lerma Rubens 01.jpg|Rubens at the Prado Museum, Madrid\n</gallery>\n\n=== Workshop ===\n<!-- [[File:The Fall of the Rebel Angels, 1621.jpg|thumb|Lucas Emil Vorsterman after Sir Peter Paul Rubens (Flemish, 1595\u20131675 ), The Fall of the Rebel Angels, 1621, engraving, Andrew W.

He is considered the most influential artist of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] tradition. Rubens's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.\n\nIn addition to running a large studio in [[Antwerp]] that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholar]] and diplomat who was [[knight]]ed by both [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Charles I of England]]. Rubens was a prolific artist.

He painted portraits, especially of friends, and self-portraits, and in later life painted several landscapes. Rubens designed tapestries and prints, as well as his own house. He also oversaw the [[ephemeral]] decorations of the [[royal entry]] into Antwerp by the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]] in 1635.\n\nHe was one of the last major artists to make consistent use of [[panel painting|wooden panels]] as a support medium, even for very large works, but he used [[canvas]] as well, especially when the work needed to be sent a long distance. For [[altarpiece]]s he sometimes painted on [[slate]] to reduce reflection problems.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens (statue).JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp by [[Guillaume Geefs]]]]\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:GARDENS IN THE RUBENS HOUSE - ANTWERP.jpg|thumb|The garden designed by Rubens at the [[Rubenshuis]] in [[Antwerpen]]]]\n\nRubens was born in the city of [[Siegen]] to [[Jan Rubens]] and [[Maria Pypelincks]]. He was named in honour of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]], because he was born on [[Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul|their solemnity]].<ref>Historische levensbeschryving van P.P. Rubens Door Jean Francois Marie Michel. p.14</ref> His father, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and mother fled Antwerp for [[Cologne]] in 1568, after increased religious turmoil and persecution of [[Protestant]]s during the rule of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] by [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd&nbsp;Duke of Alba|the Duke of Alba]]. Rubens was baptised in Cologne at [[St Peter's Church (Cologne)|St Peter's Church]].\n\nJan Rubens became the legal adviser (and lover) of [[Anna of Saxony]], the second wife of [[William the Silent|William&nbsp;I of Orange]], and settled at her court in Siegen in 1570, fathering her daughter Christine who was born in 1571.<ref>H.

Retrieved 2 February 2013.</ref>\n\nFollowing Jan Rubens's imprisonment for the affair, Peter Paul Rubens was born in 1577. The family returned to Cologne the next year. In 1589, two years after his father's death, Rubens moved with his mother Maria Pypelincks to Antwerp, where he was raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].\n\nReligion figured prominently in much of his work, and Rubens later became one of the leading voices of the Catholic Counter-Reformation style of painting<ref>Belkin (1998): 11\u201318.</ref> (he had said \"My passion comes from the heavens, not from earthly musings\").{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Apprenticeship ===\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Possibly an Architect or Geographer MET DT8854.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of a Young Scholar'', from 1597]]\n\nIn Antwerp, Rubens received a [[Renaissance humanist]] education, studying Latin and classical literature. By fourteen he began his artistic apprenticeship with [[Tobias Verhaeght]]. Subsequently, he studied under two of the city's leading painters of the time, the late [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists [[Adam van Noort]] and [[Otto van Veen]].<ref>Held (1983): 14\u201335.</ref> Much of his earliest training involved copying earlier artists' works, such as [[woodcut]]s by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s [[engraving]]s after [[Raphael]]. Rubens completed his education in 1598, at which time he entered the [[Guild of St. Luke]] as an independent master.<ref>Belkin (1998): 22\u201338.</ref>\n\n=== Italy (1600\u20131608) ===\nIn 1600 Rubens travelled to Italy. He stopped first in [[Venice]], where he saw paintings by [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and [[Tintoretto]], before settling in [[Mantua]] at the court of Duke [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Vincenzo&nbsp;I Gonzaga]]. The colouring and compositions of [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and Tintoretto had an immediate effect on Rubens's painting, and his later, mature style was profoundly influenced by [[Titian]].<ref>Belkin (1998): 42; 57.</ref> With financial support from the Duke, Rubens travelled to [[Rome]] by way of [[Florence]] in 1601. There, he studied classical Greek and Roman art and copied works of the Italian masters.  The [[Hellenistic]] sculpture ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]'' was especially influential on him, as was the art of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>Belkin (1998): 52\u201357</ref> He was also influenced by the recent, highly naturalistic paintings by [[Caravaggio]].\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Fall of Phaeton (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''[[The Fall of Phaeton (Rubens)|The Fall of Phaeton]]'', 1604, in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nRubens later made a copy of Caravaggio's ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'' and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|''The Death of the Virgin'']] ([[Louvre]]).<ref>Belkin (1998): 59.</ref> After his return to Antwerp he was instrumental in the acquisition of [[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|''The Madonna of the Rosary'']] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]]) for the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp.<ref>Sirjacobs, Raymond.

This journey marked the first of many during his career that combined art and diplomacy.\n\nHe returned to Italy in 1604, where he remained for the next four years, first in Mantua and then in [[Genoa]] and Rome. In Genoa, Rubens painted numerous portraits, such as the ''[[:File:Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria.jpg|Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria]]'' (National Gallery of Art, Washington,&nbsp;D.C.), and the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra Pallavicini, in a style that influenced later paintings by [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]].<ref>Belkin (1998): 75.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rubens Madonna on Floral Wreath.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Madonna on Floral Wreath'', together with Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1619]]\n\nHe also began a book illustrating the palaces in the city, which was published in 1622 as ''[[Palazzi di Genova]]''. From 1606 to 1608, he was mostly in Rome. During this period Rubens received, with the assistance of Cardinal Jacopo Serra (the brother of Maria Pallavicini), his most important commission to date for the High Altar of the city's most fashionable new church, [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] also known as the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].\n\nThe subject was to be [[St. Gregory the Great|St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great]] and important local saints adoring an [[icon]] of the Virgin and Child. The first version, a single canvas (now at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble), was immediately replaced by a second version on three slate panels that permits the actual miraculous holy image of the \"Santa Maria in Vallicella\" to be revealed on important feast days by a removable copper cover, also painted by the artist.<ref>Jaff\u00e9 (1977): 85\u201399; Belting (1994): 484\u201390, 554\u201356.</ref>\n\nRubens's experiences in Italy continued to influence his work. He continued to write many of his letters and correspondences in Italian, signed his name as \"Pietro Paolo Rubens\", and spoke longingly of returning to the peninsula\u2014a hope that never materialized.<ref>Belkin (1998): 95.</ref>\n\n=== Antwerp (1609\u20131621) ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens Peter Paul Rubens - The Artist and His First Wife, Isabella Brant, in the Honeysuckle Bower.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rubens and [[Isabella Brandt]], the [[Honeysuckle Bower]]'', c. 1609. [[Alte Pinakothek]]]]\n\nUpon hearing of his mother's illness in 1608, Rubens planned his departure from Italy for Antwerp. However, she died before he arrived home. His return coincided with a period of renewed prosperity in the city with the signing of the [[Treaty of Antwerp (1609)|Treaty of Antwerp]] in April 1609, which initiated the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. In September 1609 Rubens was appointed as court painter by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], sovereigns of the [[Low Countries]].\n\nHe received special permission to base his studio in Antwerp instead of at their court in [[Brussels]], and to also work for other clients. He remained close to the Archduchess Isabella until her death in 1633, and was called upon not only as a painter but also as an ambassador and diplomat. Rubens further cemented his ties to the city when, on 3 October 1609, he married [[Isabella Brant]], the daughter of a leading Antwerp citizen and humanist, Jan Brant.\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Descent from the Cross - WGA20230.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', 1618. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]\n\nIn 1610 Rubens moved into a new house and studio that he designed. Now the [[Rubenshuis]] Museum, the Italian-influenced villa in the centre of Antwerp accommodated his workshop, where he and his apprentices made most of the paintings, and his personal art collection and library, both among the most extensive in Antwerp. During this time he built up a studio with numerous students and assistants. His most famous pupil was the young [[Anthony van Dyck]], who soon became the leading Flemish portraitist and collaborated frequently with Rubens. He also often collaborated with the many specialists active in the city, including the animal painter [[Frans Snyders]], who contributed the eagle to ''[[Prometheus Bound (Rubens)|Prometheus Bound]]'' (c. 1611\u201312, completed by 1618), and his good friend the flower-painter [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]].\n\nAnother house was built by Rubens to the north of Antwerp in the [[polder]] village of [[Doel]], \"Hooghuis\" (1613/1643), perhaps as an investment. The \"High House\" was built next to the village church.\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens -Familie van Jan Bruegel de Oude - Courtauld Gallery Londen 2-12-2009 16-35-20.JPG|thumb|upright|''Family of Jan Brueghel the Elder'', 1613\u20131615. [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] ]]\n\nAltarpieces such as ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'' (1610) and ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (1611\u20131614) for the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|Cathedral of Our Lady]] were particularly important in establishing Rubens as Flanders' leading painter shortly after his return. ''The Raising of the Cross'', for example, demonstrates the artist's synthesis of [[:File:Jacopo Tintoretto 021.jpg|Tintoretto's ''Crucifixion'']] for the [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] in Venice, [[Michelangelo]]'s dynamic figures, and Rubens's own personal style. This painting has been held as a prime example of Baroque religious art.<ref>Martin (1977): 109.</ref>\n\nRubens used the production of [[Old master print|prints]] and book title-pages, especially for his friend [[Balthasar Moretus]], the owner of the large [[Plantin Press|Plantin-Moretus publishing house]], to extend his fame throughout Europe during this part of his career. In 1618, Rubens embarked upon a printmaking enterprise by soliciting an unusual triple privilege (an early form of [[copyright]]) to protect his designs in France, the Southern Netherlands, and United Provinces.<ref name=Hottle>{{cite journal|journal=Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek|last=Hottle|first=Andrew D.|title=Commerce and Connections: Peter Paul Rubens and the Dedicated Print|volume=55|year=2004|pages=54\u201385}}</ref> He enlisted [[Lucas Vorsterman]] to engrave a number of his notable religious and mythological paintings, to which Rubens appended personal and professional dedications to noteworthy individuals in the Southern Netherlands, United Provinces, England, France, and Spain.<ref name=Hottle/> With the exception of a few [[etching]]s, Rubens left the [[printmaking]] to specialists, who included Lucas Vorsterman, [[Paulus Pontius]] and [[Willem Panneels]].<ref>Pauw-De Veen (1977): 243\u2013251.</ref> He recruited a number of engravers trained by [[Christoffel Jegher]], whom he carefully schooled in the more vigorous style he wanted.

The [[Marie de' Medici cycle]] (now in the Louvre) was installed in 1625, and although he began work on the second series it was never completed.<ref>Belkin (1998): 175; 192; Held (1975): 218\u2013233, esp. pp. 222\u2013225.</ref> Marie was exiled from France in 1630 by her son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], and died in 1642 in the same house in Cologne where Rubens had lived as a child.<ref>Belkin (1998): 173\u2013175.</ref>\n\n[[File:Anna of Austria by Rubens (1622-1625, Norton Simon Museum).jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of [[Anne of Austria|Anna of Austria]]'', Queen of France, c. 1622\u20131625]]\n\nAfter the end of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621, the Spanish [[Habsburg]] rulers entrusted Rubens with a number of diplomatic missions.<ref name=\"peace\">Belkin (1998): 199\u2013228.</ref> While in Paris in 1622 to discuss the Marie de' Medici cycle, Rubens engaged in clandestine information gathering activities, which at the time was an important task of diplomats.  He relied on his friendship with [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] to get information on political developments in France.<ref>Auwers: p. 25.</ref>  Between 1627 and 1630, Rubens's diplomatic career was particularly active, and he moved between the courts of Spain and England in an attempt to bring peace between the Spanish Netherlands and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  He also made several trips to the northern Netherlands as both an artist and a diplomat.\n\nAt the courts he sometimes encountered the attitude that courtiers should not use their hands in any art or trade, but he was also received as a gentleman by many.  Rubens was raised by Philip&nbsp;IV of Spain to the nobility in 1624 and knighted by Charles I of England in 1630.  Philip IV confirmed Rubens's status as a knight a few months later.<ref>Auwers: p. 32.</ref>  Rubens was awarded an honorary [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree from [[Cambridge University]] in 1629.<ref>Belkin (1998): 339\u2013340</ref>\n\nRubens was in Madrid for eight months in 1628\u20131629. In addition to diplomatic negotiations, he executed several important works for Philip&nbsp;IV and private patrons. He also began a renewed study of Titian's paintings, copying numerous works including the Madrid ''Fall of Man'' (1628\u201329).<ref>Belkin (1998): 210\u2013218.</ref> During this stay, he befriended the court painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and the two planned to travel to Italy together the following year. Rubens, however, returned to Antwerp and Vel\u00e1zquez made the journey without him.<ref>Belkin (1998): 217\u2013218.</ref>\n\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 004.jpg|thumb|''[[The Fall of Man (Rubens)|The Fall of Man]]'', 1628\u201329. Prado, Madrid]]\n\nHis stay in Antwerp was brief, and he soon travelled on to London where he remained until April 1630. An important work from this period is the ''Allegory of Peace and War'' (1629; [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng46 |title=Minerva protects Pax from Mars ('Peace and War') |accessdate=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531113432/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG46 |archivedate=31 May 2009  }}</ref> It illustrates the artist's lively concern for peace, and was given to Charles I as a gift.\n\nWhile Rubens's international reputation with collectors and nobility abroad continued to grow during this decade, he and his workshop also continued to paint monumental paintings for local patrons in Antwerp. The ''[[Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Rubens)|Assumption of the Virgin Mary]]'' (1625\u20136) for the Cathedral of Antwerp is one prominent example.\n\n=== Last decade (1630\u20131640) ===\nRubens's last decade was spent in and around Antwerp. Major works for foreign patrons still occupied him, such as the ceiling paintings for the [[Banqueting House at Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Inigo Jones]]'s [[Palace of Whitehall]], but he also explored more personal artistic directions.\n\nIn 1630, four years after the death of his first wife Isabella, the 53-year-old painter married his first wife's niece, the 16-year-old [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment]]. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne inspired the voluptuous figures in many of his paintings from the 1630s, including ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 117.jpg|The Feast of Venus]]'' (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 026.jpg|The Three Graces]]'' and ''[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|The Judgment of Paris]]'' (both Prado, Madrid). In the latter painting, which was made for the Spanish court, the artist's young wife was recognized by viewers in the figure of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. In an intimate portrait of her, ''H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment in a Fur Wrap'', also known as ''[[Het Pelsken]]'', Rubens's wife is even partially modelled after classical sculptures of the [[Venus Pudica]], such as the [[Venus de' Medici|Medici Venus]].\n\nIn 1635, Rubens bought an estate outside Antwerp, the [[Elewijt Castle|Steen]], where he spent much of his time. Landscapes, such as his ''[[Ch\u00e2teau de Steen with Hunter]]'' (National Gallery, London) and ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 102.jpg|Farmers Returning from the Fields]]'' (Pitti Gallery, Florence), reflect the more personal nature of many of his later works. He also drew upon the Netherlandish traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] for inspiration in later works like ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 014.jpg|Flemish Kermis]]'' (c.&nbsp;1630; Louvre, Paris).\n\n=== Death ===\nRubens died from heart failure, a result of his chronic [[gout]], on 30 May 1640. He was interred in [[Saint James' Church, Antwerp]]. His epitaph read:<ref>Antwerpen \u2013 Parochiekerken; 1.

Painted in the Baroque tradition of depicting women as soft-bodied, passive, and highly sexualized beings, his nudes emphasize the concepts of fertility, desire, physical beauty, temptation, and virtue. Skillfully rendered, these paintings of nude women were undoubtedly created to appeal to his largely male audience of patrons.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=431556|title=Review on JSTOR}}</ref> Additionally, Rubens was quite fond of painting full-figured women, giving rise to terms like 'Rubensian' or 'Rubenesque' (sometimes 'Rubensesque').

His male nudes represent highly athletic and large mythical or biblical men. Unlike his female nudes, most of his male nudes are depicted partially nude, with sashes, armour, or shadows shielding them from being completely unclothed. These men are twisting, reaching, bending, and grasping: all of which portrays his male subjects engaged in a great deal of physical, sometimes aggressive, action. The concepts Rubens artistically represents illustrate the male as powerful, capable, forceful and compelling. The allegorical and symbolic subjects he painted reference the classic masculine tropes of athleticism, high achievement, valour in war, and civil authority.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Male archetypes readily found in Rubens's paintings include the hero, husband, father, civic leader, king, and the battle weary.\n\nRubens was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci's work. Using an engraving done 50 years after Leonardo started his project on the Battle of Anghiari, Rubens did a masterly drawing of the Battle which is now in the Louvre in Paris. \"The idea that an ancient copy of a lost artwork can be as important as the original is familiar to scholars,\" says Salvatore Settis, archaeologist and art historian.\n\n<!-- [[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Deborah Kip and her Children - WGA20381.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| ]] -->\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\" perrow=\"8\">\nFile:KMSKB-2011 - interior 3.jpg|Peter Paul Rubens works at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, Brussels, Belgium\nFile:0 Ixion roi des Laphites tromp\u00e9 par Junon qu\u2019il voulait s\u00e9duire - Pierre Paul Rubens (1).JPG|Peter Paul Rubens work at the Louvre\nFile:Rubens painting in front of the speaker table at a Wikipedia workshop.JPG|Peter Paul Rubens works at the [[Victor Balaguer Museum]]\nFile:Angel Garcia de Diego Museo del Prado Duque de Lerma Rubens 01.jpg|Rubens at the Prado Museum, Madrid\n</gallery>\n\n=== Workshop ===\n<!-- [[File:The Fall of the Rebel Angels, 1621.jpg|thumb|Lucas Emil Vorsterman after Sir Peter Paul Rubens (Flemish, 1595\u20131675 ), The Fall of the Rebel Angels, 1621, engraving, Andrew W.
