There is a fixed supply of [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable resources]], such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. [[Renewable resource|Renewable resources]] can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.<ref>Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367</ref> There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.<ref>McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119</ref> Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.<ref>Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.<ref>Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20</ref>\n\n===Ecological footprint===\n{{Main|Ecological footprint}}\n\nThe ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human \npopulation consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].\nAccording to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,<ref name=footprintnetwork>{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01}}</ref> inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of \n[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, \nwhile current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would \nreduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].\n\n=== Degrowth and sustainable development<ref>{{harv|Latouche|2009}}, pp. 9-13</ref> ===\nDegrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).

Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],<ref name=Latouche/> as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. \nCritics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increased [[poverty]], and decreased income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth\u2014self-sufficiency, material responsibility\u2014and would indeed lead to decreased employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate the complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic model, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.<ref name=Latouche>Latouche, S.

Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon became friends, and Grinevald devoted his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979, Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la d\u00e9croissance: Entropie \u2013 \u00c9cologie \u2013 \u00c9conomie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy \u2013 Ecology \u2013 Economy').<ref name=ngr03/> Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in the second and third editions.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}}<ref name=ngr03/><ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}}\n\nBy the time Grinevald suggested the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early-1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.<ref name=fd01/>{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently, Georgescu-Roegen criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on \"Energy and Economic Myths\", delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and later at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following:\n\n{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366f}}<br />... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}\n\nWhen reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates occurring at the time; this resemblance was captured in the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French both fed on and gave further impetus to the concept of ''d\u00e9croissance'' in France\u2014and everywhere else in the francophone world\u2014thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=fd01/>{{rp|197f}}\n\nBy the 2000s, when ''d\u00e9croissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term \"decline\" was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: \"Decline\" usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] \"degrowth\" was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and conscious basis\u2014as in the prevailing French usage of the term\u2014something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=gk01/>{{rp|874\u2013876}}\n\nWhen the first international degrowth conference was held in Paris in 2008, the participants honoured Georgescu-Roegen and his work.<ref name=ff01/>{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} In his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit trait\u00e9 de la d\u00e9croissance sereine'' (\"Farewell to Growth\"), the leading French champion of the degrowth movement, [[Serge Latouche]], credited Georgescu-Roegen as the \"...main theoretical source of degrowth\".<ref name=sl01/> Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be \"one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective\".<ref name=mb01/><!---please recover the page number in this citation--->\n\n=== Serge Latouche ===\n[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]\n[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:\n\n{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth. In 1991, the United States spent 115 billion dollars, or 2.1% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on the protection of the environment. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] increased this cost by 45 or 55 million dollars per year. [...] The [[World Resources Institute]] tried to measure the rate of the growth taking into account the punishment exerted on the [[natural capital]] of the world, with an eye towards sustainable development. For Indonesia, it found that the rate of growth between 1971 and 1984 would be reduced from 7.1 to 4% annually, and that was by taking only three variables into consideration: [[deforestation]], the reduction in the reserves of oil and natural gas, and [[soil erosion]].<ref>Herv\u00e9 Kempf, ''L'\u00e9conomie \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de l'\u00e9cologie'' Hatier</ref><ref>Latouche, Serge (2003) ''Decrecimiento y post-desarrollo'' El viejo topo, p.62</ref>}}\n\n=== Schumacher and Buddhist economics ===\n[[E. F. Schumacher]]'s 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] model of economic development, arguing that an increasing \"standard of living\", based on consumption, is absurd as a goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as [[Buddhist economics]], we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.<ref>Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered. New York: Perennial Library.</ref>\n\n=== Ecological and social issues ===\nIn January 1972, [[Edward Goldsmith]] and Robert Prescott-Allen\u2014editors of ''[[The Ecologist]]''\u2014published ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and [[deindustrialization]] to prevent what the authors referred to as \"the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet\".\n\nIn 2019, a summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services was published by the [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]]. The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.\n\n4. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including [[sustainable agriculture]], reductions in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management. In page 8 the report propose in page 8 of the summary \" enabling visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-increasing material consumption\" as one of the main measures. The report states that  \"Some pathways chosen to achieve the goals related to energy, economic growth, industry and infrastructure and sustainable consumption and production (Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, 9 and 12), as well as targets related to poverty, food security and cities (Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2 and 11), could have substantial positive or negative impacts on nature and therefore on the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |date=6 May 2019 |publisher=the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |url=https://www.ipbes.net/sites/default/files/downloads/spm_unedited_advance_for_posting_htn.pdf |accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Deutsche Welle |first1=Deutsche |title=Why Biodiversity Loss Hurts Humans as Much as Climate Change Does |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/biodiversity-loss-human-health-2636410357.html |accessdate=10 May 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=May 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Degrowth movement ==\n\n===Conferences===\nThe movement has included international conferences,<ref name=\"MOINS12\">{{in lang|fr}} \"La gen\u00e8se du R\u00e9seau Objection de Croissance en Suisse\", Julien Cart, in ''[[Moins!]]'', journal [[Suisse romande|romand]] d'\u00e9cologie politique, 12, July-August 2014.</ref> promoted by the network Research & Degrowth (R&D),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/|title=Research & Degrowth|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref> in [[Paris]] (2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/|title=D\u00e9croissance \u00e9conomique pour la soutenabilit\u00e9 \u00e9cologique et l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 sociale|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> [[Barcelona]] (2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|title=Degrowth Conference Barcelona 2010|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410204609/http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|archive-date=10 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Montreal]] (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montreal.degrowth.org/|title=International Conference on Degrowth in the Americas|access-date=2013-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531103344/http://montreal.degrowth.org/|archive-date=2014-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Venice]] (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venezia2012.it/|title=International Degrowth Conference Venezia 2012 |accessdate=5 Dec 2012}}</ref> [[Leipzig]] (2014), [[Budapest]] (2016),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://degrowth.org/2015/03/26/5-international-degrowth-conference-budapest-2016/|accessdate=2018-01-31|title=5th International Degrowth Conference in Budapest|date=2015-03-26}}</ref> and [[Malm\u00f6]] (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://malmo.degrowth.org|title=Dialogues in turbulent times|website=Dialogues in turbulent times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\n===Barcelona Conference (2010)===\nThe First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in [[Paris]] (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, and environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of [[capitalism]] and an explanation of the main principles of degrowth.<ref>''Declaration of the Paris 2008 Conference''.

Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.<ref>''L'\u00e9cologie politique \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69</ref> However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]<ref name=\"The Ecological Rift\">https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.</ref> and Fred Magdoff,<ref name=\"Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9\">{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|date=June 2012|work=Monthly Review}}</ref> in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism. This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable. Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]].\n\n====Systems theoretical critique====\nIn stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticized unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately an economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society.

There is a fixed supply of [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable resources]], such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. [[Renewable resource|Renewable resources]] can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.<ref>Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367</ref> There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.<ref>McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119</ref> Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.<ref>Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A.

For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.<ref>Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20</ref>\n\n===Ecological footprint===\n{{Main|Ecological footprint}}\n\nThe ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human \npopulation consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].\nAccording to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,<ref name=footprintnetwork>{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01}}</ref> inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of \n[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, \nwhile current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would \nreduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].\n\n=== Degrowth and sustainable development<ref>{{harv|Latouche|2009}}, pp. 9-13</ref> ===\nDegrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).

Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],<ref name=Latouche/> as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. \nCritics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increased [[poverty]], and decreased income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth\u2014self-sufficiency, material responsibility\u2014and would indeed lead to decreased employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate the complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic model, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.<ref name=Latouche>Latouche, S.

Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon became friends, and Grinevald devoted his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979, Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la d\u00e9croissance: Entropie \u2013 \u00c9cologie \u2013 \u00c9conomie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy \u2013 Ecology \u2013 Economy').<ref name=ngr03/> Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in the second and third editions.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}}<ref name=ngr03/><ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}}\n\nBy the time Grinevald suggested the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early-1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.<ref name=fd01/>{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently, Georgescu-Roegen criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on \"Energy and Economic Myths\", delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and later at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following:\n\n{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366f}}<br />... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}\n\nWhen reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates occurring at the time; this resemblance was captured in the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French both fed on and gave further impetus to the concept of ''d\u00e9croissance'' in France\u2014and everywhere else in the francophone world\u2014thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=fd01/>{{rp|197f}}\n\nBy the 2000s, when ''d\u00e9croissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term \"decline\" was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: \"Decline\" usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] \"degrowth\" was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and conscious basis\u2014as in the prevailing French usage of the term\u2014something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=gk01/>{{rp|874\u2013876}}\n\nWhen the first international degrowth conference was held in Paris in 2008, the participants honoured Georgescu-Roegen and his work.<ref name=ff01/>{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} In his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit trait\u00e9 de la d\u00e9croissance sereine'' (\"Farewell to Growth\"), the leading French champion of the degrowth movement, [[Serge Latouche]], credited Georgescu-Roegen as the \"...main theoretical source of degrowth\".<ref name=sl01/> Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be \"one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective\".<ref name=mb01/><!---please recover the page number in this citation--->\n\n=== Serge Latouche ===\n[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]\n[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:\n\n{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth.

The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] increased this cost by 45 or 55 million dollars per year. [...] The [[World Resources Institute]] tried to measure the rate of the growth taking into account the punishment exerted on the [[natural capital]] of the world, with an eye towards sustainable development. For Indonesia, it found that the rate of growth between 1971 and 1984 would be reduced from 7.1 to 4% annually, and that was by taking only three variables into consideration: [[deforestation]], the reduction in the reserves of oil and natural gas, and [[soil erosion]].<ref>Herv\u00e9 Kempf, ''L'\u00e9conomie \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de l'\u00e9cologie'' Hatier</ref><ref>Latouche, Serge (2003) ''Decrecimiento y post-desarrollo'' El viejo topo, p.62</ref>}}\n\n=== Schumacher and Buddhist economics ===\n[[E. F. Schumacher]]'s 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] model of economic development, arguing that an increasing \"standard of living\", based on consumption, is absurd as a goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as [[Buddhist economics]], we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.<ref>Schumacher, E. F. (1973).

New York: Perennial Library.</ref>\n\n=== Ecological and social issues ===\nIn January 1972, [[Edward Goldsmith]] and Robert Prescott-Allen\u2014editors of ''[[The Ecologist]]''\u2014published ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and [[deindustrialization]] to prevent what the authors referred to as \"the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet\".\n\nIn 2019, a summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services was published by the [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]]. The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.\n\n4. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including [[sustainable agriculture]], reductions in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management. In page 8 the report propose in page 8 of the summary \" enabling visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-increasing material consumption\" as one of the main measures. The report states that  \"Some pathways chosen to achieve the goals related to energy, economic growth, industry and infrastructure and sustainable consumption and production (Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, 9 and 12), as well as targets related to poverty, food security and cities (Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2 and 11), could have substantial positive or negative impacts on nature and therefore on the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |date=6 May 2019 |publisher=the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |url=https://www.ipbes.net/sites/default/files/downloads/spm_unedited_advance_for_posting_htn.pdf |accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Deutsche Welle |first1=Deutsche |title=Why Biodiversity Loss Hurts Humans as Much as Climate Change Does |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/biodiversity-loss-human-health-2636410357.html |accessdate=10 May 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=May 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Degrowth movement ==\n\n===Conferences===\nThe movement has included international conferences,<ref name=\"MOINS12\">{{in lang|fr}} \"La gen\u00e8se du R\u00e9seau Objection de Croissance en Suisse\", Julien Cart, in ''[[Moins!]]'', journal [[Suisse romande|romand]] d'\u00e9cologie politique, 12, July-August 2014.</ref> promoted by the network Research & Degrowth (R&D),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/|title=Research & Degrowth|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref> in [[Paris]] (2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/|title=D\u00e9croissance \u00e9conomique pour la soutenabilit\u00e9 \u00e9cologique et l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 sociale|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> [[Barcelona]] (2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|title=Degrowth Conference Barcelona 2010|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410204609/http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|archive-date=10 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Montreal]] (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montreal.degrowth.org/|title=International Conference on Degrowth in the Americas|access-date=2013-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531103344/http://montreal.degrowth.org/|archive-date=2014-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Venice]] (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venezia2012.it/|title=International Degrowth Conference Venezia 2012 |accessdate=5 Dec 2012}}</ref> [[Leipzig]] (2014), [[Budapest]] (2016),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://degrowth.org/2015/03/26/5-international-degrowth-conference-budapest-2016/|accessdate=2018-01-31|title=5th International Degrowth Conference in Budapest|date=2015-03-26}}</ref> and [[Malm\u00f6]] (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://malmo.degrowth.org|title=Dialogues in turbulent times|website=Dialogues in turbulent times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\n===Barcelona Conference (2010)===\nThe First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in [[Paris]] (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, and environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of [[capitalism]] and an explanation of the main principles of degrowth.<ref>''Declaration of the Paris 2008 Conference''.

Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.<ref>''L'\u00e9cologie politique \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69</ref> However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]<ref name=\"The Ecological Rift\">https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.</ref> and Fred Magdoff,<ref name=\"Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9\">{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|date=June 2012|work=Monthly Review}}</ref> in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism. This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable. Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]].\n\n====Systems theoretical critique====\nIn stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticized unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately an economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society. A corresponding recoding of growth-obsessed or capitalist organizations has recently been proposed.<ref name=\"Growth and function.

Vatatzes was her third husband, selected by her father, but Theodore&nbsp;I who had recently married the Latin [[Maria of Courtenay]] did not name his new son-in-law as his heir.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201333}} Vatatzes was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] and [[Angelos]] dynasties. When he wed Irene, he served as the commander of the imperial guard.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201334}} In November 1221, Theodore&nbsp;I died and Vatatzes had to defeat his father-in-law's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over the brothers and their Latin allies in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]] in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way to the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nThe adult Theodore's correspondence shows that his childhood in his loving and nurturing family was joyful in Nicaea. He \"often received greatest solace\" from his father and on at least one occasion his parents were unwilling to punish him when his tutor accused him of misdemeanors. He was their only child, because his mother was unable to bear children after a horse accident. He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his unbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxory surrounding him.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=59\u201360, 257 (notes 21\u201322)}} If his formal education started at the age when most other aristocratic children were taught to write and read, Theodore was entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228. He had to memorize [[psalms]] and the [[parables of Jesus]] and he could quote them by heart till the end of his life. He was required to pray three times a day.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=64\u201366}}\n\n===Education===\n\nTheodore's secondary education started around 1230. Theodore detested his principal tutor (or ''[[baioulos]]'') and described him as a \"great babbler\", without mentioning his name in his works. He studied grammar (that is Attic Greek), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meaning and in etymologies. Lessons on rhetoric made him aware of the importance of the application of allegories and myths to achieve. He admired [[Demosthenes]] and often cited [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] till the end of his life. He especially respected the rhetorical skills of the theologian [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged him to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies. Actually, Theodore was a passionate hunter and [[polo]] player with remarkable riding skills. He never wrote of studying military strategies. Most likely, discussions with his father and his father's prepared him for the command of the imperial army, because he often launched military campaigns in wintertime, imitating Vatatzes' preferred strategy.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=68\u201372, 75\u201377}}\n\nNegotiations about Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] started shortly after the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]]. In the battle, her father, Emperor (or Tzar) [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Emperor of Thessalonica]] and ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], early in 1230. The battle weakened the rival Byzantine successor state, Epirus, and made [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] the dominant power of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=738}} The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] in 1235. Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid [[Siege of Constantinople (1235)|siege to Constantinople]], but could not capture the city. Ivan Asen did a ''[[volte-face]]'', allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace in 1237, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore  for the rest of his life that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=65, 73\u201375}}\n\nAround the same time, Theodore approached a most renowned teacher, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]], to take classes of philosophy from him. Blemmydes was the [[hegumen]] (or head) of a monastery at [[Ephesus]] and Theodore attended his classes of philosophy while he was staying in his father's winter palace at the nearby [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]]. Blemmydes' zealous [[Aristotelianism]] had a strong impact on Theodore who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like [[potentiality and actuality]], in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of [[embezzlement]] by one of his students. Vatatzes' intervention saved him of imprisonment, but he abandoned teaching early in the 1240s. Theodore continued to regularly visit Blemmydes and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholars from Constantinople, [[George Akropolites]], replaced Blemmydes. He had first hand experiences about the Latin rule in the city. Akropolites was better suited to the task than Blemmydes, because he was an imperial secretary, mainly staying in the imperial court. He completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=79, 85, 117\u2013118}}\n\nTheodore II received a scholarly education by [[George Akropolites]]{{sfn|Rosser|2011|page=460}} and [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] the latter who would become a tutor to him,<ref>Michael Angold [https://books.google.com/books?id=f7tmAAAAMAAJ&q=theodore+II+laskaris+education+Nicephorus+Blemmydes&dq=theodore+II+laskaris+education+Nicephorus+Blemmydes&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=lSpfVYDHKcjjU-HkgbAJ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ \"The Fourth Crusade: Event and Context\"]\nLongman (originally published by the [[University of Michigan]]), 2003 {{ISBN|0582356105}} p 209</ref> and remained devoted to science and art throughout his life. \n\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=88}} Vatatzes re-maried in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Anna of Hohenstaufen|Constanza]] whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. Marchesina was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Rule==\n\n===His father's co-ruler===\n\nIf Theodore's father adopted his predecessors' practice, Theodore was still a child when he was made his father's co-emperor. [[George Akropolites]] mentioned Theodore as a Co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was most probably not crowned during his father's life\u2014that is why two later Byzantine historians, [[George Pachymeres]] and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], denied that he had been a co-emperor.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=61, 258 (notes 34 and 36)}}\n\nVatatzes [[Siege of Constantinople (1241)|besieged Constantinople]] in May and June 1241, but he could not capture it. Theodore participated in the subsequent negotiations with the Latins which ended with a two-year truce on 24 June. The death of Theodore's father-in-law around the same time weakened Bulgaria. Taking advantage of the situation, Vatatzes launched a military campaign against Epirus, appointing Theodore his lieutenant in Anatolia. A Mongol general, [[Baiju Noyan|Baiju]], [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|invaded]] the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] in eastern Anatolia and captured [[Erzerum]]. On hearing of the Mongol invasion, Theodore sent envoys to his father, who was besieging [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], but Vatatzes abandoned the siege only after the ruler of the city, [[John Komnenos Doukas]], renounced the title of emperor and swore fealty to him. The Mongols made a new military campaign against Rum and routed Sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] on 26 June 1243. The Seljuks of Rum were forced to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols. Nicaea remained the only Anatolian state that could maintain its full independence of the Mongols, but the fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=720\u2013721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nVatatzes departed for a new military campaign in the Balkans in 1246, leaving Theodore in charge of the administration of Anatolia. After Vatatzes' capture of Serres, Thessalonica and Melnik voluntarily surrendered and Vatatzes expanded his rule as far as northern Macedonia, thus almost doubling his empire's territory.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 96\u201397}} As his father's co-ruler, Theodore received delegations and discussed state matters either together with his father or alone. The reception of petitions from clergymen, aristocrats and commoners was part of his daily routine. Blemmydes' petitions show that Theodore's authority was considerable: he could grant estates and salaries and he could intervene in legal disputes, even ordering the metropolitan of Epirus to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery after it refunded the price. His authority to preside over the privy council in his father absence and to propose candidates to Church offices is also documented. Similarly to his grandfather and father, Theodore held an itinerant court and visited most Anatolian towns and villages.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=98\u2013102}}\n\nA bond of close friendship was forged between Theodore and a circle of young intelectuals during his co-emperorship. They were all born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, without experiencing the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch [[Germanus II of Constantinople]] referred to them). Theodore's writings reveal that his friends' companion helped him to come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, [[George Mouzalon]], had been a page in his childhood entourage. Blemmydes noted that George and his two brothers, Theodore and Andronikos Mouzalon, were \"of despicably low birth\". They were talented singers and musicians who regularly appeared in musical performances in the imperial court. Other confidants of his, like [[Joseph Mesopotamites]] and [[Konstas Hagiotheodorites]], were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=109\u2013118}}\n\nIn his correspondence with his friends, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggradizement, their barbarian speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance. Theodore was also object of mockery: his unnamed fellow students teased him for his arguments in philosophical discussions. Critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous. The [[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], rebuked Theodore for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of [[fasting]]. A military commander, Kalothetos, often spoke of Theodore without respect. Relationship between Theodore and his father's governor at Thessalonica, [[Theodore Philes]], was extremly tense. Philes circulated deflamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman and Theodore blamed Philes for the murder of Theodore's friend, Tribides. Tribides' fate shows that Theodore started sending his confidants to the newly conquered European territories already during his father's reign. Philes' accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes who did not tolerate sexual misconduct. Blemmydes had recently, around 1248, denied entry Marchesina and her retinue to his monastery at Ephesus. Now, he addressed a mirror of princes, entitled ''Imperial Statue'', to Vatatzes and Theodore, warning them against lechery and the dissipation of public funds. Theodore denied the charges in a series of letters to his former tutor. Theodore also hold a grudge against his second cousin, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], for unknown reason.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90, 118\u2013125}}\n\nVatatzes launched a military campaign against the ruler of Epirus, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], in March of April 1252. Before his depature, he appointed Theodore his viceroy in Anatolia. Elena of Bulgaria unexpectedly before the end of the summer. He mourned for his wife for more than the customary fourty days and only abandoned fasting and wearing black on his father's order. His wife's death intensified his melancholy and he dedicated more time to philosophical studies and writing. He resumed his regular visits of the Anatolian towns in 1253.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 128\u2013132}}\n\nEmperor Frederick&nbsp;II's son and successor, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], forced most relatives of his father's mistress, [[Bianca Lancia]], into exile early in 1253. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum in the court of Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Theodore received the exiles in one of the imperial palaces. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite [[Berthold of Hohenburg]], an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to start negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Europe, Theodore and Berthold made philosophical conversations. Interest in ancient philosophy had intensified in Europe. Berthold and the philosophers and phycisians in his retinue wanted to take advantage of his diplomatic mission and asked Theodore to grant Greek philosophical works to them. Their request reinforced Theodore's pride of Hellenism. He also decided to prepare manuscript editions of his philosophical works.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=140\u2013145}}\n\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell suddenly ill and he never fully recovered. His illnes made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire, but the change of his position did not prevented him from making arrangements for the publications of his works. News about preparations for a new Mongol invasion of Anatolia reached Nicaea, causing concern in the imperial court.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n===Sole emperor===\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4 November 1254. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he could not be crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Acropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans  to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"[[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]\" of the [[Book of Exodus]], guiding the [[Israelites]]. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, [[Kaykaus II]], in [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]], and they concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols shortly after his ascension to the throne. Kaykaus acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but failed to pay homage to the Great Khan [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] personally.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|p=721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe appointment of a new patriarch was also a main concern for Theodore. He wanted to achieve the appointment of Blemmydes, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, [[Arsenius Autoreianus|Arsenios Autoreianos]], was a hermit of aristocratic background. Arsenios accepted the offer and he was ordained patriarch. As his first act, the new Patriarch crowned and annointed Theodore emperor\u2014according to scholarly consensus, on Christmas 1254. Arsenios' allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=150, 296 (note 25)}}\n\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\" in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254, without naming his opponents. Historian [[Michael Angold]] proposes that Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's similary policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\".{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=748}} Theodore appointed George to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new ''[[megas domestikos]]''. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new ''[[protovestiarites]]'' (or commander of the guards of the imperial palace). He also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, [[Constantine Margarites]]. His appointments offended the military aristocracy of the empire. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n[[Michael II Asen]], Tzar of Bulgaria, exploited Vatatzes' death and invaded Thrace and Macedonia in December 1254. He seized Thracian fortresses and two Macedonian towns, [[Veles, North Macedonia|Veles]] and [[Skopje]], on the river [[Vardar]]. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal about an immediate counter-attack. Theodore assembled an army and departed for Adrianople in February 1255, charging Mouzalon with the administration of Anatolia. His surprise attack forced the Bulgarian to withdraw from Thrace and he appointed two aristocrats, [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] and [[Demetrios Torinikes]] to continue the military campaign against the Bulgarians. While marching across the passes of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], the two generals mistook the sounds of the horns of shepherds ans swineherds with signals of an ambush. They fled in panic, abandoning their baggage. Their fiasco outraged Theodore who ordered them to return, but Strategopoulos and Torinikes disobeyed.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\nA Bulgarian renegate in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer of 1255. Theodore departed from Adrianople to Melnik. He avoided the ambush that the Bulgarians had lain along the [[Rupel Pass]] before reaching Melnik and forcing Dragotas to abandon the siege. He visited Thessalonica where he dismissed Philes, Strategopoulos and Torinikes. He also closed down the local mint and established a new treasury in Astritzion on the Asian coast of the [[Hellespont]], because he wanted to concentrate the administration of his finances in Anatolia instead of the rebellious Balkans. Theodore invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from marching across the [[Ov\u010de Pole]], forcing him to return to Serres. He confirmed the nearby towns' fiscal privileges, but he ordered the arrest of [[Constantine Kabasila]], [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], assuming that Kabasila was Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus' loyal supporter.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=156\u2013159}}\n\nA report about a Mongol invasion of Anatolia forced him to leave Macedonia in late autumn. He hurried to Adrianople where he realized that the report was distorted. Theodore launched an attack against the fortress of [[Tzepaina]], but his army could not cross the narrow and frosty passes of the Rhodope and Theodore returned to Anatolia at the end of 1255. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commander-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with the implementation of military reforms. On the other hand, members of old aristocratic families were punished. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes were blinded, while Alexios Strategopoulos and [[Alexios Raoul]]'s four sons were imprisoned. Michael Palaiologos fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. He take advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married a niece of Michael Palaiologos, [[Theodora Raoulaina|Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina]], his brother, Andronikos, wed a daughter of [[Alexios Raoul]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=159\u2013162, 169}}\n\nTheodore resumed negotiations about the [[church union]] in April or May 1256. He sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander IV]], offering his mediation between the Pope and the Patriarch. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had adopted different views about the procession of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Orthodox theologians maintained that the [[Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding the Filioque|Holy Spirit procceeded from the Father alone]], while Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the [[God the Father|Father]] [[filioque|and the Son]]. Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, saying that the Bible and the [[Church Fathers]] suggested that the Holy Spirit processed from the Father through the [[God the Son|Son]], but Theodore insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine. The Pope sent Constantine, [[Bishop of Orvieto]], as his legate to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nMichael&nbsp;II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to keep a defensive strategy. They ignored his instruction and chased the Cumans, who inflicted a heavy defeat on the Nicaean troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and the Nicaean troops defeated the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II with the mediation of [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]], [[Banate of Macs\u00f3|Duke of Macs\u00f3]]. Michael&nbsp;II had recently married Rostislav's daughter and Rostislav's wife, [[Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs\u00f3|Anna of Hungary]], was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael&nbsp;II's behalf on 29 June. The treaty prescribed Michael&nbsp;II to cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites in a fit of anger. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\nFrom Thrace, Theodore went to Thessalonica where he entered into negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus's wife, [[Theodora of Arta|Theodora Petraliphaina]]. To secure a lasting peace with Nicaea, she agreed to cede [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Dyrrachium]] to Theodore, establishing the Nicaean control of the [[Via Egnatia]]. Theodore married off his daughter, Maria to the heir to the Epirote throne, [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros Komnenos Doukas]], in October. Theodore also received the papal legate, but their negotiations proved fruitless and Constantine of Orvieto died during his journey back to Italy. Theodore maintained a correspondence with powerful [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], like [[Richard Annibaldi]], [[Peter Capoccio]] and [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]], but he refused to make concessions for the church union.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nThe Mongols invaded Anatolia and defeated Kaykaus&nbsp;II on 14 October 1256. On learning of the Mongol invasion, Theodore hurried back to Anatolia. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, [[Kilij Arslan IV]], as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc]] sent an embassy to Theodore and he persuaded the Ilkhan to withdraw his army from Anatolia. H\u00fcleg\u00fc also allowed Kaykaus to return to Rum, ordering the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and his brother in the spring of 1257. Theodore concluded an agreement with Kaykaus who ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]] to him in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops from Nicaea.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=721\u2013722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\nBulgaria fell into a state of anarchy. Michael&nbsp;II was dethroned by his cousin, [[Kaliman Asen II of Bulgaria|Kaliman&nbsp;II]], but Kaliman was murdered by [[boyar]]s (or noblemen). Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael&nbsp;II's brother-in-law, [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso]], laid claim to the throne, but most boyars offered their allegiance to one of their number, [[Konstantin Tih]], although he was not related to the [[Asen dynasty]]. Theodore's daughters by Elena were Tzar Ivan Asen&nbsp;II's granddaughters and Konstantin sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]]. Theodore agreed and sent her to Bulgaria to marry the Tzar.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nTheodore was complacent after his achievements. He proadly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Do\u011fanyurt|Cape Karambis]] on the [[Black Sea]]. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him that he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries. Theodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. [[George Pachymeres]], who was less than sixteen around that time, diagnozed his illness as epilepsy. Akropolites and Blemmydes did not mention epilepsy. Akropolites only mentioned that Theodore lost weight and \"his entire body was reduced to a skeleton\". In a letter to Blemmydes, Theodore wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arm. His illness cannot identified certainly, but it could be epilepsy of the grand-mal type or cancer of the brain, the spine or the lungs. He could no more command his troops personally.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=172\u2013174, 176, 381\u2013383}} \n\nIn Macedonia, Theodore had dismissed the commanders of noble origin with close family ties to the local aristocracy with Anatolian officers of humble origin. His appointees, however, could not resist after Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus had incited the local Albanian chiefs to a rebellion in late 1256. [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], intervened and defeated Theodore's local commander, Xyleas, near [[Prilep]]. An other newly appointed commander, [[Constantine Chabaron]], was trapped, allegedly through love letters that Michael&nbsp;II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphina, had sent to him. Theodore sent an army of peasant soldiers to Macedonia, but they were routed at [[Edessa|Edessa, Greece]]. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, lead a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael&nbsp;II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites. Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's illegitimate son, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], who had taken control of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] after the death of his stepbrother, Conrad, concluded an alliance with Michael&nbsp;II. He captured Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nTheodore ordered that books that he and his father had collected in urban libraries be available to all who wanted to read them.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=106}}\n\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He became convinced that sorcery had caused his illness. Theodore had forced Michael Palaiologos's niece, Theodore to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios. The marriage was never consummated and Kaballarios accused Theodora's, Maria-Martha Palaiologna, of witchcraft. She was publicly humilated and tortured. Although she did not confess, Theodore ordered the imprisonment of her brother, Michael Palaiologos, for a while. Theodore named his only son, [[John IV Laskaris|John]], as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. He became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16 August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on [[Mount Sipylus]]. His grave and the monastery was destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nThe succession of Theodore was exploited by the [[Bulgaria]]ns, who invaded [[Thrace]] under the leadership of the young and inexperienced [[Michael II Asen of Bulgaria|Michael Asen I of Bulgaria]] in 1255.  In spite of his own scholarly predisposition, Theodore immediately marched against the Bulgarians and inflicted a crushing defeat on them. During his second expedition in 1256, he managed to conclude a favorable peace with Bulgaria, which may have plunged the latter into a crisis of leadership. Theodore followed up his victory against Bulgaria by expanding his control in the west, where he annexed [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] and [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], effectively outflanking his rivals in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]].\n\nInternally, Theodore favored bureaucrats from the middle classes instead of members of the great aristocratic families. Michael Angold explains this as in part, a matter of his temperament:\n: He [Theodore] was happier in the company of a cultivated circle of friends, some of whom had been his childhood companions (''paidopoula''). He clearly disliked what he considered the philistinism prevalent among a section of the young men at his father's court.<ref>Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'' (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 76</ref>\nTheodore's favoring of commoners faced considerable opposition by the nobility to the Emperor and his chief minister, the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[George Mouzalon]], who grew up with Theodore II as his childhood companion.{{sfn|Rosser|2011|page=460}} The conflict led to the exile of one of the leaders of the aristocratic faction, the future Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], who was accused of conspiring with the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuks of Rum]]. In the midst of this crisis, Theodore's [[Epilepsy|epileptic]] condition worsened, and the Emperor died on August 16, 1258,<ref>For this date, see Albert Failler, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rebyz_0766-5598_1980_num_38_1_2105 \"Chronologie et composition dans l'Histoire de Georges Pachym\u00e8re\"], ''Revue des \u00e9tudes byzantines'', '''38''' (1980), pp. 20-23</ref> leaving George Mouzalon as the [[regent]] for his minor son [[John IV Laskaris]] who was seven years old at the time.{{sfn|Rosser|2011|page=460}}\n\n==Family==\n\nNeither Theodore nor Elena reached the minimum legal age of marriage\u2014fourteen for boys and twelfe for girls\u2014when they were married, but such an early marriage was not unique among Nicaean aristocrats and commoners. She was born to Ivan Asen&nbsp;II and [[Anna Maria of Hungary|Maria of Hungary]] in 1224. The wedding took place at Lampsakos early in 1235. Two years later, before launching an invasion of Nicaean territories in Thrace, her father forced Elena to return to Bulgaria, but peace was restored between the two empires and Elena returned to Theodore before the end of the year. Years later, Theodore described Elena as the flower of his youth and stated that their \"bond of incomparable love\" made them \"happier than all people\". Her sudden death in the spring or summer of 1252 plunged Theodore into grief. She gave birth to five daughters, and one son.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=72\u201375, 120}}    \n\nThey had several children including:<ref>Failler, ''Chronologie et composition'', pp. 65-77</ref>\n* [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina]], who married [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine I of Bulgaria]]\n* Maria Doukaina Laskarina, who married [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]] of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]<ref>Failler, \"Chronologie et composition\", p. 68</ref>\n\nHaving taken the imperial throne and made the 11-year-old John IV ineligible for the emperorship by blinding him, Michael VIII Palaiologos had Theodore's three other daughters married off to Italian and Bulgarian foreigners,<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Last Centuries of Byzantium (1261\u20131453) |chapter=The price of survival |first=Donald M. |last=Nicol |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-521-43991-4 }}</ref> so their descendants could not threaten his own children's claim to the imperial succession.

Vatatzes was her third husband, selected by her father, but Theodore&nbsp;I who had recently married the Latin [[Maria of Courtenay]] did not name his new son-in-law as his heir.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201333}} Vatatzes was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] and [[Angelos]] dynasties. When he wed Irene, he served as the commander of the imperial guard.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201334}} In November 1221, Theodore&nbsp;I died and Vatatzes had to defeat his father-in-law's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over the brothers and their Latin allies in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]] in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way to the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nThe adult Theodore's correspondence shows that his childhood in his loving and nurturing family was joyful in Nicaea. He \"often received greatest solace\" from his father and on at least one occasion his parents were unwilling to punish him when his tutor accused him of misdemeanors. He was their only child, because his mother was unable to bear children after a horse accident. He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his unbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxory surrounding him.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=59\u201360, 257 (notes 21\u201322)}} If his formal education started at the age when most other aristocratic children were taught to write and read, Theodore was entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228. He had to memorize [[psalms]] and the [[parables of Jesus]] and he could quote them by heart till the end of his life. He was required to pray three times a day.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=64\u201366}}\n\n===Education===\n\nTheodore's secondary education started around 1230. Theodore detested his principal tutor (or ''[[baioulos]]'') and described him as a \"great babbler\", without mentioning his name in his works. He studied grammar (that is Attic Greek), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meaning and in etymologies. Lessons on rhetoric made him aware of the importance of the application of allegories and myths to achieve. He admired [[Demosthenes]] and often cited [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] till the end of his life. He especially respected the rhetorical skills of the theologian [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged him to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies. Actually, Theodore was a passionate hunter and [[polo]] player with remarkable riding skills. He never wrote of studying military strategies. Most likely, discussions with his father and his father's prepared him for the command of the imperial army, because he often launched military campaigns in wintertime, imitating Vatatzes' preferred strategy.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=68\u201372, 75\u201377}}\n\nNegotiations about Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] started shortly after the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]]. In the battle, her father, Emperor (or Tzar) [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Emperor of Thessalonica]] and ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], early in 1230. The battle weakened the rival Byzantine successor state, Epirus, and made [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] the dominant power of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=738}} The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] in 1235. Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid [[Siege of Constantinople (1235)|siege to Constantinople]], but could not capture the city. Ivan Asen did a ''[[volte-face]]'', allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace in 1237, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore  for the rest of his life that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=65, 73\u201375}}\n\nAround the same time, Theodore approached a most renowned teacher, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]], to take classes of philosophy from him. Blemmydes was the [[hegumen]] (or head) of a monastery at [[Ephesus]] and Theodore attended his classes of philosophy while he was staying in his father's winter palace at the nearby [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]]. Blemmydes' zealous [[Aristotelianism]] had a strong impact on Theodore who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like [[potentiality and actuality]], in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of [[embezzlement]] by one of his students. Vatatzes' intervention saved him of imprisonment, but he abandoned teaching early in the 1240s. Theodore continued to regularly visit Blemmydes and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholars from Constantinople, [[George Akropolites]], replaced Blemmydes. He had first hand experiences about the Latin rule in the city. Akropolites was better suited to the task than Blemmydes, because he was an imperial secretary, mainly staying in the imperial court. He completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=79, 85, 117\u2013118}}\n\nTheodore II received a scholarly education by [[George Akropolites]]{{sfn|Rosser|2011|page=460}} and [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] the latter who would become a tutor to him,<ref>Michael Angold [https://books.google.com/books?id=f7tmAAAAMAAJ&q=theodore+II+laskaris+education+Nicephorus+Blemmydes&dq=theodore+II+laskaris+education+Nicephorus+Blemmydes&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=lSpfVYDHKcjjU-HkgbAJ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ \"The Fourth Crusade: Event and Context\"]\nLongman (originally published by the [[University of Michigan]]), 2003 {{ISBN|0582356105}} p 209</ref> and remained devoted to science and art throughout his life. \n\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=88}} Vatatzes re-maried in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Anna of Hohenstaufen|Constanza]] whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. Marchesina was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Rule==\n\n===His father's co-ruler===\n\nIf Theodore's father adopted his predecessors' practice, Theodore was still a child when he was made his father's co-emperor. [[George Akropolites]] mentioned Theodore as a Co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was most probably not crowned during his father's life\u2014that is why two later Byzantine historians, [[George Pachymeres]] and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], denied that he had been a co-emperor.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=61, 258 (notes 34 and 36)}}\n\nVatatzes [[Siege of Constantinople (1241)|besieged Constantinople]] in May and June 1241, but he could not capture it. Theodore participated in the subsequent negotiations with the Latins which ended with a two-year truce on 24 June. The death of Theodore's father-in-law around the same time weakened Bulgaria. Taking advantage of the situation, Vatatzes launched a military campaign against Epirus, appointing Theodore his lieutenant in Anatolia. A Mongol general, [[Baiju Noyan|Baiju]], [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|invaded]] the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] in eastern Anatolia and captured [[Erzerum]]. On hearing of the Mongol invasion, Theodore sent envoys to his father, who was besieging [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], but Vatatzes abandoned the siege only after the ruler of the city, [[John Komnenos Doukas]], renounced the title of emperor and swore fealty to him. The Mongols made a new military campaign against Rum and routed Sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] on 26 June 1243. The Seljuks of Rum were forced to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols. Nicaea remained the only Anatolian state that could maintain its full independence of the Mongols, but the fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=720\u2013721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nVatatzes departed for a new military campaign in the Balkans in 1246, leaving Theodore in charge of the administration of Anatolia. After Vatatzes' capture of Serres, Thessalonica and Melnik voluntarily surrendered and Vatatzes expanded his rule as far as northern Macedonia, thus almost doubling his empire's territory.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 96\u201397}} As his father's co-ruler, Theodore received delegations and discussed state matters either together with his father or alone. The reception of petitions from clergymen, aristocrats and commoners was part of his daily routine. Blemmydes' petitions show that Theodore's authority was considerable: he could grant estates and salaries and he could intervene in legal disputes, even ordering the metropolitan of Epirus to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery after it refunded the price. His authority to preside over the privy council in his father absence and to propose candidates to Church offices is also documented. Similarly to his grandfather and father, Theodore held an itinerant court and visited most Anatolian towns and villages.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=98\u2013102}}\n\nA bond of close friendship was forged between Theodore and a circle of young intelectuals during his co-emperorship. They were all born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, without experiencing the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch [[Germanus II of Constantinople]] referred to them). Theodore's writings reveal that his friends' companion helped him to come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, [[George Mouzalon]], had been a page in his childhood entourage. Blemmydes noted that George and his two brothers, Theodore and Andronikos Mouzalon, were \"of despicably low birth\". They were talented singers and musicians who regularly appeared in musical performances in the imperial court. Other confidants of his, like [[Joseph Mesopotamites]] and [[Konstas Hagiotheodorites]], were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=109\u2013118}}\n\nIn his correspondence with his friends, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggradizement, their barbarian speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance. Theodore was also object of mockery: his unnamed fellow students teased him for his arguments in philosophical discussions. Critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous. The [[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], rebuked Theodore for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of [[fasting]]. A military commander, Kalothetos, often spoke of Theodore without respect. Relationship between Theodore and his father's governor at Thessalonica, [[Theodore Philes]], was extremly tense. Philes circulated deflamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman and Theodore blamed Philes for the murder of Theodore's friend, Tribides. Tribides' fate shows that Theodore started sending his confidants to the newly conquered European territories already during his father's reign. Philes' accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes who did not tolerate sexual misconduct. Blemmydes had recently, around 1248, denied entry Marchesina and her retinue to his monastery at Ephesus. Now, he addressed a mirror of princes, entitled ''Imperial Statue'', to Vatatzes and Theodore, warning them against lechery and the dissipation of public funds. Theodore denied the charges in a series of letters to his former tutor. Theodore also hold a grudge against his second cousin, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], for unknown reason.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90, 118\u2013125}}\n\nVatatzes launched a military campaign against the ruler of Epirus, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], in March of April 1252. Before his depature, he appointed Theodore his viceroy in Anatolia. Elena of Bulgaria unexpectedly before the end of the summer. He mourned for his wife for more than the customary fourty days and only abandoned fasting and wearing black on his father's order. His wife's death intensified his melancholy and he dedicated more time to philosophical studies and writing. He resumed his regular visits of the Anatolian towns in 1253.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 128\u2013132}}\n\nEmperor Frederick&nbsp;II's son and successor, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], forced most relatives of his father's mistress, [[Bianca Lancia]], into exile early in 1253. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum in the court of Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Theodore received the exiles in one of the imperial palaces. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite [[Berthold of Hohenburg]], an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to start negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Europe, Theodore and Berthold made philosophical conversations. Interest in ancient philosophy had intensified in Europe. Berthold and the philosophers and phycisians in his retinue wanted to take advantage of his diplomatic mission and asked Theodore to grant Greek philosophical works to them. Their request reinforced Theodore's pride of Hellenism. He also decided to prepare manuscript editions of his philosophical works.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=140\u2013145}}\n\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell suddenly ill and he never fully recovered. His illnes made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire, but the change of his position did not prevented him from making arrangements for the publications of his works. News about preparations for a new Mongol invasion of Anatolia reached Nicaea, causing concern in the imperial court.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n===Sole emperor===\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4 November 1254. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he could not be crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Acropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans  to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"[[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]\" of the [[Book of Exodus]], guiding the [[Israelites]]. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, [[Kaykaus II]], in [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]], and they concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols shortly after his ascension to the throne. Kaykaus acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but failed to pay homage to the Great Khan [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] personally.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|p=721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe appointment of a new patriarch was also a main concern for Theodore. He wanted to achieve the appointment of Blemmydes, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, [[Arsenius Autoreianus|Arsenios Autoreianos]], was a hermit of aristocratic background. Arsenios accepted the offer and he was ordained patriarch. As his first act, the new Patriarch crowned and annointed Theodore emperor\u2014according to scholarly consensus, on Christmas 1254. Arsenios' allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=150, 296 (note 25)}}\n\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\" in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254, without naming his opponents. Historian [[Michael Angold]] proposes that Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's similary policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\".{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=748}} Theodore appointed George to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new ''[[megas domestikos]]''. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new ''[[protovestiarites]]'' (or commander of the guards of the imperial palace). He also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, [[Constantine Margarites]]. His appointments offended the military aristocracy of the empire. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n[[Michael II Asen]], Tzar of Bulgaria, exploited Vatatzes' death and invaded Thrace and Macedonia in December 1254. He seized Thracian fortresses and two Macedonian towns, [[Veles, North Macedonia|Veles]] and [[Skopje]], on the river [[Vardar]]. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal about an immediate counter-attack. Theodore assembled an army and departed for Adrianople in February 1255, charging Mouzalon with the administration of Anatolia. His surprise attack forced the Bulgarian to withdraw from Thrace and he appointed two aristocrats, [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] and [[Demetrios Torinikes]] to continue the military campaign against the Bulgarians. While marching across the passes of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], the two generals mistook the sounds of the horns of shepherds ans swineherds with signals of an ambush. They fled in panic, abandoning their baggage. Their fiasco outraged Theodore who ordered them to return, but Strategopoulos and Torinikes disobeyed.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\nA Bulgarian renegate in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer of 1255. Theodore departed from Adrianople to Melnik. He avoided the ambush that the Bulgarians had lain along the [[Rupel Pass]] before reaching Melnik and forcing Dragotas to abandon the siege. He visited Thessalonica where he dismissed Philes, Strategopoulos and Torinikes. He also closed down the local mint and established a new treasury in Astritzion on the Asian coast of the [[Hellespont]], because he wanted to concentrate the administration of his finances in Anatolia instead of the rebellious Balkans. Theodore invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from marching across the [[Ov\u010de Pole]], forcing him to return to Serres. He confirmed the nearby towns' fiscal privileges, but he ordered the arrest of [[Constantine Kabasila]], [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], assuming that Kabasila was Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus' loyal supporter.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=156\u2013159}}\n\nA report about a Mongol invasion of Anatolia forced him to leave Macedonia in late autumn. He hurried to Adrianople where he realized that the report was distorted. Theodore launched an attack against the fortress of [[Tzepaina]], but his army could not cross the narrow and frosty passes of the Rhodope and Theodore returned to Anatolia at the end of 1255. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commander-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with the implementation of military reforms. On the other hand, members of old aristocratic families were punished. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes were blinded, while Alexios Strategopoulos and [[Alexios Raoul]]'s four sons were imprisoned. Michael Palaiologos fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. He take advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married a niece of Michael Palaiologos, [[Theodora Raoulaina|Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina]], his brother, Andronikos, wed a daughter of [[Alexios Raoul]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=159\u2013162, 169}}\n\nTheodore resumed negotiations about the [[church union]] in April or May 1256. He sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander IV]], offering his mediation between the Pope and the Patriarch. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had adopted different views about the procession of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Orthodox theologians maintained that the [[Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding the Filioque|Holy Spirit procceeded from the Father alone]], while Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the [[God the Father|Father]] [[filioque|and the Son]]. Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, saying that the Bible and the [[Church Fathers]] suggested that the Holy Spirit processed from the Father through the [[God the Son|Son]], but Theodore insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine. The Pope sent Constantine, [[Bishop of Orvieto]], as his legate to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nMichael&nbsp;II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to keep a defensive strategy. They ignored his instruction and chased the Cumans, who inflicted a heavy defeat on the Nicaean troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and the Nicaean troops defeated the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II with the mediation of [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]], [[Banate of Macs\u00f3|Duke of Macs\u00f3]]. Michael&nbsp;II had recently married Rostislav's daughter and Rostislav's wife, [[Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs\u00f3|Anna of Hungary]], was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael&nbsp;II's behalf on 29 June. The treaty prescribed Michael&nbsp;II to cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites in a fit of anger. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\nFrom Thrace, Theodore went to Thessalonica where he entered into negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus's wife, [[Theodora of Arta|Theodora Petraliphaina]]. To secure a lasting peace with Nicaea, she agreed to cede [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Dyrrachium]] to Theodore, establishing the Nicaean control of the [[Via Egnatia]]. Theodore married off his daughter, Maria to the heir to the Epirote throne, [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros Komnenos Doukas]], in October. Theodore also received the papal legate, but their negotiations proved fruitless and Constantine of Orvieto died during his journey back to Italy. Theodore maintained a correspondence with powerful [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], like [[Richard Annibaldi]], [[Peter Capoccio]] and [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]], but he refused to make concessions for the church union.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nThe Mongols invaded Anatolia and defeated Kaykaus&nbsp;II on 14 October 1256. On learning of the Mongol invasion, Theodore hurried back to Anatolia. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, [[Kilij Arslan IV]], as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc]] sent an embassy to Theodore and he persuaded the Ilkhan to withdraw his army from Anatolia. H\u00fcleg\u00fc also allowed Kaykaus to return to Rum, ordering the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and his brother in the spring of 1257. Theodore concluded an agreement with Kaykaus who ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]] to him in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops from Nicaea.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=721\u2013722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\nBulgaria fell into a state of anarchy. Michael&nbsp;II was dethroned by his cousin, [[Kaliman Asen II of Bulgaria|Kaliman&nbsp;II]], but Kaliman was murdered by [[boyar]]s (or noblemen). Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael&nbsp;II's brother-in-law, [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso]], laid claim to the throne, but most boyars offered their allegiance to one of their number, [[Konstantin Tih]], although he was not related to the [[Asen dynasty]]. Theodore's daughters by Elena were Tzar Ivan Asen&nbsp;II's granddaughters and Konstantin sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]]. Theodore agreed and sent her to Bulgaria to marry the Tzar.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nTheodore was complacent after his achievements. He proadly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Do\u011fanyurt|Cape Karambis]] on the [[Black Sea]]. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him that he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries. Theodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. [[George Pachymeres]], who was less than sixteen around that time, diagnozed his illness as epilepsy. Akropolites and Blemmydes did not mention epilepsy. Akropolites only mentioned that Theodore lost weight and \"his entire body was reduced to a skeleton\". In a letter to Blemmydes, Theodore wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arm. His illness cannot identified certainly, but it could be epilepsy of the grand-mal type or cancer of the brain, the spine or the lungs. He could no more command his troops personally.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=172\u2013174, 176, 381\u2013383}} \n\nIn Macedonia, Theodore had dismissed the commanders of noble origin with close family ties to the local aristocracy with Anatolian officers of humble origin. His appointees, however, could not resist after Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus had incited the local Albanian chiefs to a rebellion in late 1256. [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], intervened and defeated Theodore's local commander, Xyleas, near [[Prilep]]. An other newly appointed commander, [[Constantine Chabaron]], was trapped, allegedly through love letters that Michael&nbsp;II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphina, had sent to him. Theodore sent an army of peasant soldiers to Macedonia, but they were routed at [[Edessa|Edessa, Greece]]. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, lead a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael&nbsp;II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites. Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's illegitimate son, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], who had taken control of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] after the death of his stepbrother, Conrad, concluded an alliance with Michael&nbsp;II. He captured Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\nTheodore ordered that books that he and his father had collected in urban libraries be available to all who wanted to read them.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=106}}\n\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He became convinced that sorcery had caused his illness. Theodore had forced Michael Palaiologos's niece, Theodore to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios. The marriage was never consummated and Kaballarios accused Theodora's, Maria-Martha Palaiologna, of witchcraft. She was publicly humilated and tortured. Although she did not confess, Theodore ordered the imprisonment of her brother, Michael Palaiologos, for a while. Theodore named his only son, [[John IV Laskaris|John]], as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. He became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16 August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on [[Mount Sipylus]]. His grave and the monastery was destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nThe succession of Theodore was exploited by the [[Bulgaria]]ns, who invaded [[Thrace]] under the leadership of the young and inexperienced [[Michael II Asen of Bulgaria|Michael Asen I of Bulgaria]] in 1255.  In spite of his own scholarly predisposition, Theodore immediately marched against the Bulgarians and inflicted a crushing defeat on them. During his second expedition in 1256, he managed to conclude a favorable peace with Bulgaria, which may have plunged the latter into a crisis of leadership. Theodore followed up his victory against Bulgaria by expanding his control in the west, where he annexed [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] and [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], effectively outflanking his rivals in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]].\n\nInternally, Theodore favored bureaucrats from the middle classes instead of members of the great aristocratic families. Michael Angold explains this as in part, a matter of his temperament:\n: He [Theodore] was happier in the company of a cultivated circle of friends, some of whom had been his childhood companions (''paidopoula''). He clearly disliked what he considered the philistinism prevalent among a section of the young men at his father's court.<ref>Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'' (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 76</ref>\nTheodore's favoring of commoners faced considerable opposition by the nobility to the Emperor and his chief minister, the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[George Mouzalon]], who grew up with Theodore II as his childhood companion.{{sfn|Rosser|2011|page=460}} The conflict led to the exile of one of the leaders of the aristocratic faction, the future Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], who was accused of conspiring with the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuks of Rum]]. In the midst of this crisis, Theodore's [[Epilepsy|epileptic]] condition worsened, and the Emperor died on August 16, 1258,<ref>For this date, see Albert Failler, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rebyz_0766-5598_1980_num_38_1_2105 \"Chronologie et composition dans l'Histoire de Georges Pachym\u00e8re\"], ''Revue des \u00e9tudes byzantines'', '''38''' (1980), pp. 20-23</ref> leaving George Mouzalon as the [[regent]] for his minor son [[John IV Laskaris]] who was seven years old at the time.{{sfn|Rosser|2011|page=460}}\n\n==Family==\n\nNeither Theodore nor Elena reached the minimum legal age of marriage\u2014fourteen for boys and twelfe for girls\u2014when they were married, but such an early marriage was not unique among Nicaean aristocrats and commoners. She was born to Ivan Asen&nbsp;II and [[Anna Maria of Hungary|Maria of Hungary]] in 1224. The wedding took place at Lampsakos early in 1235. Two years later, before launching an invasion of Nicaean territories in Thrace, her father forced Elena to return to Bulgaria, but peace was restored between the two empires and Elena returned to Theodore before the end of the year. Years later, Theodore described Elena as the flower of his youth and stated that their \"bond of incomparable love\" made them \"happier than all people\". Her sudden death in the spring or summer of 1252 plunged Theodore into grief. She gave birth to five daughters, and one son.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=72\u201375, 120}}    \n\nThey had several children including:<ref>Failler, ''Chronologie et composition'', pp. 65-77</ref>\n* [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina]], who married [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine I of Bulgaria]]\n* Maria Doukaina Laskarina, who married [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]] of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]<ref>Failler, \"Chronologie et composition\", p. 68</ref>\n\nHaving taken the imperial throne and made the 11-year-old John IV ineligible for the emperorship by blinding him, Michael VIII Palaiologos had Theodore's three other daughters married off to Italian and Bulgarian foreigners,<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Last Centuries of Byzantium (1261\u20131453) |chapter=The price of survival |first=Donald M. |last=Nicol |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-521-43991-4 }}</ref> so their descendants could not threaten his own children's claim to the imperial succession.

The franchise mainly focuses on the fictional character [[Jason Voorhees]], who drowned as a boy at [[Camp Crystal Lake]] due to the negligence of the camp staff. Decades later, the lake is rumored to be \"cursed\" and is the setting for a series of mass murders. Jason is featured in all of the films, as either the killer or the motivation for the killings. The [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|original film]], created to cash in on the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978),<ref name=\"F1 insp\">{{cite book|last=Grove|first=David|title=Making Friday the 13th: The Legend of Camp Blood|publisher=FAB Press|date=February 2005|location=United Kingdom|pages=11\u201312|isbn=1-903254-31-0}}</ref> was written by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]] and was produced and directed by [[Sean S. Cunningham]]. The films have grossed over $529 million at the box-office worldwide. It was the highest-grossing horror franchise in the world until the release of ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018), putting [[Halloween (franchise)|that franchise]] in the top spot.\n\n[[Frank Mancuso, Jr.]], a producer of the films, also developed the television show ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'' after Paramount released ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives|Jason Lives]]''. The television series was not connected to the franchise by any character or setting, but was created based on the idea of \"bad luck and curses\", which the film series symbolized.<ref name=\"the series\">Grove, David, pp. 189\u2013196</ref> While the franchise was owned by Paramount, four films were adapted into novels, with ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' adapted by two separate authors. When the franchise was sold to [[New Line Cinema]], Cunningham returned as a producer to oversee two additional films, in addition to a [[Freddy vs. Jason|crossover film]] with character [[Freddy Krueger]] from [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]]. Under New Line Cinema, thirteen [[novella]]s and various comic book series featuring Jason were published.\n\nAlthough the films were not popular with critics, ''Friday the 13th'' is considered one of the most successful media franchises in America\u2014not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture.<ref name=\"IGN ranking\"/> The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own ''Friday the 13th'' films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with ''Friday the 13th'' artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=99% border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s) \n! scope=\"col\" | Story\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | {{start date|1980|05|09|}}\n| align=\"center\" | [[Sean S.

Accordingly, the companies put ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' on hold in hopes that they would move forward with this next installment when the economy bounced back. Form explained that neither studio would walk away from the sequel's production to allow the other to move forward as the primary producing house, each studio concerned that its players would look like \"idiots\" should the sequel perform well without its involvement. Form and Fuller also mentioned that the ''Friday the 13th'' sequel may be a 3\u2011D film, should it ever again be [[Green-light|green-lit]] for production by the studios.<ref>{{Citation|last=Weintraub|first=Steve \"Frosty\"|title=Exclusive Interview: Platinum Dunes Producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET \u2013 Plus Updates on MONSTER SQUAD, OUIJA, FRIDAY THE 13th 2, and the NIGHTMARE Blu-ray will Have a 6-Minute Alternate Ending|publisher=Collider|date=April 26, 2010|url=https://www.collider.com/2010/04/26/exclusive-interview-producers-andrew-form-and-brad-fuller-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-plus-updates-on-monster-squad-ouija-friday-the-13th-2-and-the-nightmare-blu-ray-will-have-a-6-minute-alternat/|access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2011, Fuller announced via Twitter that Shannon and Smith had completed writing a script for the sequel.

The show starred [[John D. LeMay]] as Ryan Dallion and [[Louise Robey]] as Michelle Foster. It was created by Frank Mancuso, Jr. and Larry B. Williams originally under the title of ''The 13th Hour'', and the series ran for 72 episodes. Mancuso, Jr. never intended to link the television show directly to the film series, but he utilized \"the idea of ''Friday the 13th'', which is that it symbolizes bad luck and curses\". The creators wanted to tie\u2011in Jason's trademark hockey mask to the series, but the idea was discarded so that the show could have a chance to exist on its own. Mancuso, Jr. was afraid that mentioning any events from the films would take the audience away from \"the new world that we were trying to create\". The decision to name the show ''Friday the 13th'' over the original title was made because Mancuso, Jr. believed a \"''Friday the 13th''\" moniker would better help to sell the show to networks. Filming took place in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=\"the series\"/> ''Friday the 13th: The Series'' initially aired in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication|first-run syndication]] in a late-night spot; the success of the series as a late-night show prompted some broadcasting stations to move it to [[primetime]]. Produced on a budget estimated below $500,000 per episode, the first season placed second in the male 18- to 49-year-old demographic, just behind Paramount's ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. In addition, the first season placed fifth in the female 18- to 49-year-old demographic.<ref>{{cite news|author=Aljean Harmetz|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DB1739F936A35754C0A96E948260|title=TV Producers Discover New Path to Prime Time (page 2)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1988-07-05|accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2003, during a panel session at the Maniafest convention, Sean S.

A caption on the top of the image reads: \"From the producers of ''The Last House on the Left'' comes the most terrifying film ever made!\"]]\nThe original ''Friday the 13th'' was produced and directed by [[Sean S. Cunningham]], who had previously worked with filmmaker [[Wes Craven]] on [[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|''The Last House on the Left'']] (1972). Cunningham, inspired by the success of [[John Carpenter]]'s [[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'']] (1978), wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be shocking, visually stunning, and \"[make] you jump out of your seat\". Distancing himself from ''The Last House on the Left'', Cunningham wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be more of a \"roller coaster ride\".<ref name=\"F1 insp\"/> The first film was meant to be \"a real scary movie\", and at the same time make audiences laugh. The concept for ''Friday the 13th'' began as nothing more than a title. ''A Long Night at Camp Blood'' was the working title Victor Miller used while he drafted a script, but Cunningham believed in his \"Friday the 13th\" moniker and rushed to place an [[advertising|advertisement]] in ''International Variety''. Worrying that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. Cunningham commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his visual concept of the ''Friday the 13th'' logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass.<ref name=\"production\">Grove, David, pp.15\u201316</ref> In the end, Cunningham believed there were \"no problems\" with the title, but distributor George Mansour contends that there was an issue: \"There was a movie before ours called ''Friday the 13th: The Orphan''. Moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. It is unknown whether Phil [Scuderi] paid them off, but the issue was eventually resolved.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bracke|first=Peter|title=Crystal Lake Memories|publisher=Titan Books|date=2006-10-11|location=United Kingdom|page=17|isbn=1-84576-343-2}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''Friday the 13th'' in 1980, Paramount Pictures began plans to make a sequel and immediately acquired the worldwide distribution rights. According to Paramount Pictures' Chairman and CEO Frank Mancuso, Sr., \"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\" Initial ideas for a sequel involved the ''Friday the 13th'' title being used for a series of discontinuous films, released once a year, and each would be a separate \"scary movie\" of its own right. Phil Scuderi\u2014a co\u2011owner of Esquire Theaters with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian and a producer of the original film\u2014insisted that the sequel must have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance at the end of the original film was only meant to be a joke. [[Steve Miner]], associate producer of the first film, believed in the idea, and he ultimately directed the first two sequels after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair.<ref name=\"part2\">Brack, Peter, pp. 50\u201352</ref>\n\nThe studio continued to generate sequels over the years, based on the financial success they produced compared to their relatively low budgets. With every film repeating the same basic premise, the filmmakers came up with subtle adjustments so the audience would return.

So until they really stopped coming, why not continue to make more?\" ''A New Beginning'' shifted the focus of the story to the character of Tommy Jarvis and how he battles his inner demons, hallucinations, and \"rages to kill\" after his ordeal with Jason in ''The Final Chapter''.<ref name=\"part5\">Bracke, Peter, pg.122\u2013123</ref> This premise was not repeated, as the very next installment brought Jason back from the dead.

The idea proposed by screenwriter Daryl Haney stemmed from his realization that the films always ended with Jason battling the \"[[final girl]]\". Haney decided that this [[Tina Shepard (Friday the 13th)|final girl]] should have [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic powers]], which led Producer Barbara Sachs to dub the film, ''Jason vs. [[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]''.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg.173</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Okay, we'll make Vancouver look like New York and we'll do it that way.

[[New York City]] was selected as the main setting, with Jason spending approximately a third of the movie on a boat before reaching New York. The film was then subtitled ''Jason Takes Manhattan''. Ultimately, the character spent the majority of the time on the cruise ship, as budget restrictions forced scenes of New York to be trimmed or downgraded. [[Vancouver]] had to substitute for the majority of the New York scenes.<ref name=\"part 8\">Bracke, Peter, pp.194\u2013195</ref>\n\nWhen ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' failed to perform successfully at the box office, Sean Cunningham decided that he wanted to reacquire the rights to ''Friday the 13th'' from Paramount and start working with New Line Cinema on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', as New Line owned the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new, since Paramount had approached New Line about filming a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to ''Friday the 13th''. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make ''The New Blood''. After ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', Wes Craven returned to New Line to make ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]''. This effectively put ''Freddy vs. Jason'' on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with ''Jason Goes to Hell''.<ref name=\"part9\">Bracke, Peter, pp.218\u2013219</ref> The ninth installment \"turned a healthy profit\", though it was only intended to open the door for a crossover with Freddy Krueger rather than to start a new series for New Line.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 238</ref> Ultimately, the film series would go through another sequel before that would happen.\n\nCunningham's \"frustration\" with the delayed development of the ''Freddy vs. Jason'' project forced him to create another sequel in an effort to keep the franchise in the minds of audiences. Based on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''{{'}}s concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the 10th film would put the titular character in space.<ref name=\"part 10\">Bracke, Peter, pp.242\u2013243</ref> The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002, and it would go on to become the lowest-grossing film in the franchise at the domestic box office. It also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pp.263\u2013264</ref> After more than 15 years of off-and-on development, and approximately $6 million spent in 18 unused scripts from more than a dozen screenwriters, New Line finally produced a Freddy and Jason crossover for 2003. One of the biggest hurdles for the film was developing a story that managed to bring the two horror icons together. Potential stories varied widely, from Freddy having molested and drowned Jason as a child, to a cult of Freddy worshipers called the \"Fred Heads\".<ref>Bracke, Peter, pp.267\u2013269</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, [[Platinum Dunes]] producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller outlined their intended goal to bring a ''Friday the 13th'' reboot to life. New Line approached Fuller and Form to create a reboot, but because Paramount still owned certain copyrights to the first film, the reboot would not be able to use anything from the original. Paramount, who wanted to be included in the development of a reboot, approached the producers and gave them license to use anything from the original films, including the title. With Paramount on board, Fuller and Form decided they wanted to use pieces from the early films. Fuller said, \"I think there are moments we want to address, like how does the hockey mask happen.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Devin Faraci|url=http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=news&id=8452|title=Exclusive: Paging Tommy Jarvis|publisher=CHUD|date=2007-01-08|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> Shannon and Swift, writers of ''Freddy vs. Jason'', were brought on to pen the script for the new film,<ref name=\"Shan/Swif\">{{cite news|author=Borys Kit|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia426500233e132c71ea0487278b5bbb3|title=Duo pumps new blood into 'Friday the 13th'|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2007-10-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092956/http://hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia426500233e132c71ea0487278b5bbb3 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2007-10-11}}</ref> with [[Marcus Nispel]], director of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' remake of 2003, hired in November 2007 to direct.<ref>{{cite news|author=Borys Kit |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib4d95be28520da0db0f10edad41c0123 |title=Nispel scores a date with next 'Friday' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2007-11-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122145427/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib4d95be28520da0db0f10edad41c0123 |archivedate=2008-11-22 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office and reception===\n<!--PLEASE NOTE: THE 2010 INFLATION CALCULATOR IS CITED ONCE, AND THE INITIAL BOX OFFICE NUMBERS ARE CITED FROM BOXOFFICEMOJO.COM.

Three [[Managing editor|senior editors]], the [[editor-in-chief]], and IGN's entertainment editorial manager judged the various film franchises. In commenting on ''Friday the 13th''{{'}}s seventh-place ranking, the general consensus among the reviewers was that even though the ''Halloween'' franchise started the slasher genre, ''Friday the 13th'' became one of \"the most influential franchises of the 1980s\" and that its commercial success through 11 films, novelizations, comic books, and other collectables is proof of its legacy.<ref name=\"IGN ranking\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/751/751471p1.html|title=IGN:Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #7|website=IGN|date=2006-12-18|accessdate=2008-01-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113045133/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/18/top-25-movie-franchises-of-all-time-7|archivedate=2016-01-13}}</ref> [[ABC Online]]'s Arts and Entertainment reporter, Gary Kemble, makes note of the popularity of the franchise throughout popular culture.

Talking with Brenna O'Brien, co\u2011founder of the Fridaythe13thfilms.com website, the pair discusses how the fan base of the franchise has become so impassioned with the series that they have created films, latex body suits to emulate Jason's appearance, and tattoos of Jason and the ''Friday the 13th'' moniker on their body.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Everybody in the audience imitated hoot\u2011owls and hyenas.

T. Karnick, editor of ''American Culture'', wrote an article for the ''[[National Review]]'' detailing the impact ''Friday the 13th'' has had on the slasher genre and noting that the reasons critics have deplored the films are the same reasons why the franchise has had such a strong influence. Karnick explained that ''Friday the 13th'' did not try and recreate the same \"clever\" film that John Carpenter made in 1978, but instead \"[codified] the formula\" of ''Halloween'', and \"[boiled] it down to its essentials\" so that it could be copied by other filmmakers. In his assessment, ''Friday the 13th'' changed the horror genre by purposefully not providing back\u2011stories for characters so that when the audience witnessed a character's death, they are \"strangely unaffected\". Instead, ''Friday the 13th'' focuses on the history and motivations of the killer, who would exact revenge not on the people directly responsible, but on innocent people\u2014a formula Karnick notes was replicated in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'', ''Child's Play'', ''Scream'', ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', ''Saw'', the Hannibal Lecter films, and the ''Halloween'' sequels. As Karnick sees it, \"these films spoke directly to fears of increasing crime and social dislocation [and] provided audiences with ways to detach from these worries and conquer their fears of violence by laughing at it.\"<ref name=\"Karnick\">{{cite magazine|author=S.

Quoting director John Carpenter, Karnick emphasized that \"teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply because they were too preoccupied to notice the presence of a murderer\". Pointing to [[Roger Ebert]] as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood the films (Ebert wrote that during a screening of ''Friday the 13th Part 2'', he noticed that the audience had no sympathy for the victims and cheered during death scenes), Karnick explains that Ebert's remarks show how the film series forces \"audiences to experience the very thing that motivates the murders: a lack of compassion\". In closing, Karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical, but proved that audiences \"could be just as indifferent and callous as the characters in the films\".<ref name=\"Karnick\"/>\n\n==Music==\nWhen [[Harry Manfredini]] began working on the [[Sheet music|musical score]] for the 1980 film, the decision was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be.<ref name=\"slash\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/harry.HTML |title=Slasherama interview with Harry Manfredini |publisher=Slasherama |accessdate=2007-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511052302/http://www.slasherama.com/features/harry.HTML |archivedate=2006-05-11 |df= }}</ref> Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: \"There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her.

That was a choice.\"<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini also noted that when something ''was'' about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.\n{{Listen|filename=F13theme.ogg|pos=left|title=''Friday the 13th'' theme|description=Harry Manfredini's theme, used to identify the presence of the killer in the ''Friday the 13th'' film series|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nSince Mrs. Voorhees, the killer in the original ''Friday the 13th'', does not show up until the final reel of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence.<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini was inspired by the 1975 film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', where the shark is not seen for the majority of the film, but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience as to when the shark was present during scenes and unseen.<ref name=\"Man\">Bracke, Peter, pg. 39</ref> While listening to a piece of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] music, which contained a chorus with \"striking pronunciations\", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound for ''Friday the 13th''. He came up with the sound \"ki ki ki, ma ma ma\", based on the line \"Kill her mommy!\", which Mrs. Voorhees recites repeatedly in the final reel. The \"ki\" comes from \"kill\", and the \"ma\" from \"mommy\". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words \"harshly, distinctly, and rhythmically into a microphone\" and ran them into an echo [[reverberation]] machine.<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini finished the original score after a few weeks and recorded it in a friend's basement.<ref name=\"Man\"/> Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as \"iconographic\". Manfredini makes note of the mispronunciation of the sounds: \"Everybody thinks it's cha, cha, cha. I'm like, 'Cha, cha, cha'? What are you talking about?\"<ref name=\"ReturntoCrystalLake\">{{cite video|people=Victor Miller, Jay Keuper, Harry Manfredini|title=\"Return to Crystal Lake: Making of Friday the 13th\" ''Friday the 13th'' DVD (Special Features)|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=WB|date=1980}}</ref>\n\nWhen Manfredini returned for the first sequel, he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 70</ref> Over the course of the sequels, Manfredini loosened the philosophy that the theme should be reserved just for the killer. Manfredini describes the style of the sequels as more of a \"setting 'em up and knocking 'em down\" approach, which meant that there were more \"[[MacGuffin|McGuffins]] and red\u2011herrings\" that required the killer's theme music be played to try to trick the audience. Manfredini explains, \"The original had the real myopic approach, and then we had to start thinking of the sequels as more conventional films.\"<ref name=\"slash\"/> For ''Part 3'', Manfredini only returned to score the first and last reels of the film because he was busy with a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Jack Tillar pieced together portions of the score from the first two films to fill the remaining time for ''Part 3'', while Michael Zagar composed an opening and closing theme. Manfredini and Zagar met at the latter's apartment, where Zagar rescored the original opening theme using a disco beat. Manfredini returned for ''The Final Chapter'', and although there were similar elements to the score, everything was newly recorded for the fourth ''Friday the 13th''.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 118</ref>\n\nWhen he began work on the score for ''A New Beginning'', Manfredini created a theme just for the character of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was to suggest that there was \"madness afoot\", which he believed helped to \"'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not as you might expect\".<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 142</ref> For ''Jason Lives'', Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, \"but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves\". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's \"Eeeeeeee!\" sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a \"Gothic\" resonance.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 165</ref>\n\nManfredini did not score ''The New Blood'' and ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' because of prior film engagements, but his scores from previous films were reused.<ref name=\"slash\"/> While Manfredini was working on Sean Cunningham's ''[[DeepStar Six]]'', Producer Iain Paterson hired Fred Mollin, who was scoring ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'', to finish composing the music to ''The New Blood''. Manfredini's original music only filled half the film.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 189</ref> Mollin returned to fully score ''Jason Takes Manhattan'', and worked with Steve Mizer to write an original song reminiscent of [[Robert Plant]] for the opening credits.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 211</ref> Manfredini would score the next two entries in the series before being replaced on ''Freddy vs. Jason''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrymanfredini.com/filmography/|title=Harry Manfredini's filmography|publisher=HarryManfredini.com|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> The official reason for Manfredini's replacement was because New Line wanted to take the series in a \"new direction\", but Manfredini contends that the final cut of ''Freddy vs. Jason'' was \"just the same thing\".<ref name=\"slash\"/>\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Novels===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I couldn't believe it.

Under New Line Cinema, thirteen [[novella]]s and various comic book series featuring Jason were published.\n\nAlthough the films were not popular with critics, ''Friday the 13th'' is considered one of the most successful media franchises in America\u2014not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture.<ref name=\"IGN ranking\"/> The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own ''Friday the 13th'' films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with ''Friday the 13th'' artwork.

The show starred [[John D. LeMay]] as Ryan Dallion and [[Louise Robey]] as Michelle Foster. It was created by Frank Mancuso, Jr. and Larry B. Williams originally under the title of ''The 13th Hour'', and the series ran for 72 episodes. Mancuso, Jr. never intended to link the television show directly to the film series, but he utilized \"the idea of ''Friday the 13th'', which is that it symbolizes bad luck and curses\". The creators wanted to tie\u2011in Jason's trademark hockey mask to the series, but the idea was discarded so that the show could have a chance to exist on its own. Mancuso, Jr. was afraid that mentioning any events from the films would take the audience away from \"the new world that we were trying to create\". The decision to name the show ''Friday the 13th'' over the original title was made because Mancuso, Jr. believed a \"''Friday the 13th''\" moniker would better help to sell the show to networks. Filming took place in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=\"the series\"/> ''Friday the 13th: The Series'' initially aired in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication|first-run syndication]] in a late-night spot; the success of the series as a late-night show prompted some broadcasting stations to move it to [[primetime]]. Produced on a budget estimated below $500,000 per episode, the first season placed second in the male 18- to 49-year-old demographic, just behind Paramount's ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. In addition, the first season placed fifth in the female 18- to 49-year-old demographic.<ref>{{cite news|author=Aljean Harmetz|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DB1739F936A35754C0A96E948260|title=TV Producers Discover New Path to Prime Time (page 2)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1988-07-05|accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2003, during a panel session at the Maniafest convention, Sean S.

The series would focus more on \"coming-of-age issues\", in a similar style to ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', and ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', with Jason as more of a recurring \"background\" character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/sean.HTML|title=The Godfather|publisher=Slasherama|date=2005-10-22|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, it was announced that [[Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films]] and Crystal Lake Entertainment were planning to produce an hour-long ''Friday the 13th'' television series.

A caption on the top of the image reads: \"From the producers of ''The Last House on the Left'' comes the most terrifying film ever made!\"]]\nThe original ''Friday the 13th'' was produced and directed by [[Sean S. Cunningham]], who had previously worked with filmmaker [[Wes Craven]] on [[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|''The Last House on the Left'']] (1972). Cunningham, inspired by the success of [[John Carpenter]]'s [[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'']] (1978), wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be shocking, visually stunning, and \"[make] you jump out of your seat\". Distancing himself from ''The Last House on the Left'', Cunningham wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be more of a \"roller coaster ride\".<ref name=\"F1 insp\"/> The first film was meant to be \"a real scary movie\", and at the same time make audiences laugh. The concept for ''Friday the 13th'' began as nothing more than a title. ''A Long Night at Camp Blood'' was the working title Victor Miller used while he drafted a script, but Cunningham believed in his \"Friday the 13th\" moniker and rushed to place an [[advertising|advertisement]] in ''International Variety''. Worrying that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. Cunningham commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his visual concept of the ''Friday the 13th'' logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass.<ref name=\"production\">Grove, David, pp.15\u201316</ref> In the end, Cunningham believed there were \"no problems\" with the title, but distributor George Mansour contends that there was an issue: \"There was a movie before ours called ''Friday the 13th: The Orphan''. Moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. It is unknown whether Phil [Scuderi] paid them off, but the issue was eventually resolved.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bracke|first=Peter|title=Crystal Lake Memories|publisher=Titan Books|date=2006-10-11|location=United Kingdom|page=17|isbn=1-84576-343-2}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''Friday the 13th'' in 1980, Paramount Pictures began plans to make a sequel and immediately acquired the worldwide distribution rights. According to Paramount Pictures' Chairman and CEO Frank Mancuso, Sr., \"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\" Initial ideas for a sequel involved the ''Friday the 13th'' title being used for a series of discontinuous films, released once a year, and each would be a separate \"scary movie\" of its own right. Phil Scuderi\u2014a co\u2011owner of Esquire Theaters with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian and a producer of the original film\u2014insisted that the sequel must have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance at the end of the original film was only meant to be a joke. [[Steve Miner]], associate producer of the first film, believed in the idea, and he ultimately directed the first two sequels after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair.<ref name=\"part2\">Brack, Peter, pp. 50\u201352</ref>\n\nThe studio continued to generate sequels over the years, based on the financial success they produced compared to their relatively low budgets. With every film repeating the same basic premise, the filmmakers came up with subtle adjustments so the audience would return. Changes involved the addition of a subtitle\u2014as opposed to just a number attached to the end\u2014like \"The Final Chapter\" and \"Jason Takes Manhattan\", or filming the movie in [[3-D film|3-D]], as Miner did for ''Friday the 13th Part III''.<ref name=\"part3\">Bracke, Peter, pp.73\u201374</ref> The third film would also be the birthplace of one of the most recognizable images in popular culture, that of Jason's hockey mask.<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200601/s1546063.htm | title=Movie Minutiae: the Friday the 13th series (1980-?) | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=2006-01-13 | accessdate=2007-05-21 | author=Gary Kemble | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311030052/http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200601/s1546063.htm | archivedate=March 11, 2010}}</ref> Producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. eventually decided to kill Jason for good, after he experienced problems finding new films to produce that were more than just horror movies, because his name brought constant association to the ''Friday the 13th'' film series.<ref name=\"part4\">Bracke, Peter, pg.98</ref>\n\nJason would not stay buried for long, as the success of ''The Final Chapter'' ensured another ''Friday the 13th'' film. Mancuso, Sr. stated, \"Quite simply, the public still wanted to see these films. So until they really stopped coming, why not continue to make more?\" ''A New Beginning'' shifted the focus of the story to the character of Tommy Jarvis and how he battles his inner demons, hallucinations, and \"rages to kill\" after his ordeal with Jason in ''The Final Chapter''.<ref name=\"part5\">Bracke, Peter, pg.122\u2013123</ref> This premise was not repeated, as the very next installment brought Jason back from the dead.

The idea proposed by screenwriter Daryl Haney stemmed from his realization that the films always ended with Jason battling the \"[[final girl]]\". Haney decided that this [[Tina Shepard (Friday the 13th)|final girl]] should have [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic powers]], which led Producer Barbara Sachs to dub the film, ''Jason vs. [[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]''.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg.173</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Okay, we'll make Vancouver look like New York and we'll do it that way.

[[New York City]] was selected as the main setting, with Jason spending approximately a third of the movie on a boat before reaching New York. The film was then subtitled ''Jason Takes Manhattan''. Ultimately, the character spent the majority of the time on the cruise ship, as budget restrictions forced scenes of New York to be trimmed or downgraded. [[Vancouver]] had to substitute for the majority of the New York scenes.<ref name=\"part 8\">Bracke, Peter, pp.194\u2013195</ref>\n\nWhen ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' failed to perform successfully at the box office, Sean Cunningham decided that he wanted to reacquire the rights to ''Friday the 13th'' from Paramount and start working with New Line Cinema on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', as New Line owned the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new, since Paramount had approached New Line about filming a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to ''Friday the 13th''. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make ''The New Blood''. After ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', Wes Craven returned to New Line to make ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]''. This effectively put ''Freddy vs. Jason'' on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with ''Jason Goes to Hell''.<ref name=\"part9\">Bracke, Peter, pp.218\u2013219</ref> The ninth installment \"turned a healthy profit\", though it was only intended to open the door for a crossover with Freddy Krueger rather than to start a new series for New Line.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 238</ref> Ultimately, the film series would go through another sequel before that would happen.\n\nCunningham's \"frustration\" with the delayed development of the ''Freddy vs. Jason'' project forced him to create another sequel in an effort to keep the franchise in the minds of audiences. Based on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''{{'}}s concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the 10th film would put the titular character in space.<ref name=\"part 10\">Bracke, Peter, pp.242\u2013243</ref> The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002, and it would go on to become the lowest-grossing film in the franchise at the domestic box office. It also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pp.263\u2013264</ref> After more than 15 years of off-and-on development, and approximately $6 million spent in 18 unused scripts from more than a dozen screenwriters, New Line finally produced a Freddy and Jason crossover for 2003. One of the biggest hurdles for the film was developing a story that managed to bring the two horror icons together. Potential stories varied widely, from Freddy having molested and drowned Jason as a child, to a cult of Freddy worshipers called the \"Fred Heads\".<ref>Bracke, Peter, pp.267\u2013269</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, [[Platinum Dunes]] producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller outlined their intended goal to bring a ''Friday the 13th'' reboot to life. New Line approached Fuller and Form to create a reboot, but because Paramount still owned certain copyrights to the first film, the reboot would not be able to use anything from the original. Paramount, who wanted to be included in the development of a reboot, approached the producers and gave them license to use anything from the original films, including the title. With Paramount on board, Fuller and Form decided they wanted to use pieces from the early films. Fuller said, \"I think there are moments we want to address, like how does the hockey mask happen.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Devin Faraci|url=http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=news&id=8452|title=Exclusive: Paging Tommy Jarvis|publisher=CHUD|date=2007-01-08|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> Shannon and Swift, writers of ''Freddy vs. Jason'', were brought on to pen the script for the new film,<ref name=\"Shan/Swif\">{{cite news|author=Borys Kit|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia426500233e132c71ea0487278b5bbb3|title=Duo pumps new blood into 'Friday the 13th'|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2007-10-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092956/http://hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia426500233e132c71ea0487278b5bbb3 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2007-10-11}}</ref> with [[Marcus Nispel]], director of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' remake of 2003, hired in November 2007 to direct.<ref>{{cite news|author=Borys Kit |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib4d95be28520da0db0f10edad41c0123 |title=Nispel scores a date with next 'Friday' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2007-11-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122145427/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib4d95be28520da0db0f10edad41c0123 |archivedate=2008-11-22 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office and reception===\n<!--PLEASE NOTE: THE 2010 INFLATION CALCULATOR IS CITED ONCE, AND THE INITIAL BOX OFFICE NUMBERS ARE CITED FROM BOXOFFICEMOJO.COM.

Qualifications included: the franchise must have at least three films released before December 2006; the franchises must be either a commercial or artistic success; and the franchise must have had some form of impact on popular culture. Three [[Managing editor|senior editors]], the [[editor-in-chief]], and IGN's entertainment editorial manager judged the various film franchises. In commenting on ''Friday the 13th''{{'}}s seventh-place ranking, the general consensus among the reviewers was that even though the ''Halloween'' franchise started the slasher genre, ''Friday the 13th'' became one of \"the most influential franchises of the 1980s\" and that its commercial success through 11 films, novelizations, comic books, and other collectables is proof of its legacy.<ref name=\"IGN ranking\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/751/751471p1.html|title=IGN:Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #7|website=IGN|date=2006-12-18|accessdate=2008-01-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113045133/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/18/top-25-movie-franchises-of-all-time-7|archivedate=2016-01-13}}</ref> [[ABC Online]]'s Arts and Entertainment reporter, Gary Kemble, makes note of the popularity of the franchise throughout popular culture. Kemble points out that Jason's mask, which was not adopted until the third film in the series, is one of the most widely recognizable images in popular culture. Talking with Brenna O'Brien, co\u2011founder of the Fridaythe13thfilms.com website, the pair discusses how the fan base of the franchise has become so impassioned with the series that they have created films, latex body suits to emulate Jason's appearance, and tattoos of Jason and the ''Friday the 13th'' moniker on their body.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Everybody in the audience imitated hoot\u2011owls and hyenas.

T. Karnick, editor of ''American Culture'', wrote an article for the ''[[National Review]]'' detailing the impact ''Friday the 13th'' has had on the slasher genre and noting that the reasons critics have deplored the films are the same reasons why the franchise has had such a strong influence. Karnick explained that ''Friday the 13th'' did not try and recreate the same \"clever\" film that John Carpenter made in 1978, but instead \"[codified] the formula\" of ''Halloween'', and \"[boiled] it down to its essentials\" so that it could be copied by other filmmakers. In his assessment, ''Friday the 13th'' changed the horror genre by purposefully not providing back\u2011stories for characters so that when the audience witnessed a character's death, they are \"strangely unaffected\". Instead, ''Friday the 13th'' focuses on the history and motivations of the killer, who would exact revenge not on the people directly responsible, but on innocent people\u2014a formula Karnick notes was replicated in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'', ''Child's Play'', ''Scream'', ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', ''Saw'', the Hannibal Lecter films, and the ''Halloween'' sequels. As Karnick sees it, \"these films spoke directly to fears of increasing crime and social dislocation [and] provided audiences with ways to detach from these worries and conquer their fears of violence by laughing at it.\"<ref name=\"Karnick\">{{cite magazine|author=S. T. Karnick|title=Babes in the Woods: A franchise of fear.|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YWFkNjI2ZGZlZjJjMTc3NWU0YWQ2ZWI1NzkzNzI3MjE=|magazine=[[National Review]]|date=2009-02-13|accessdate=2009-02-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215031818/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YWFkNjI2ZGZlZjJjMTc3NWU0YWQ2ZWI1NzkzNzI3MjE%3D|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn Karnick's eyes, contemporary critics have failed to see how the film has affected audiences and subsequently branded the film series as \"both irresponsible (for numbing audiences to violence) and puritanical (for showing the murders of sexually active teens)\". Quoting director John Carpenter, Karnick emphasized that \"teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply because they were too preoccupied to notice the presence of a murderer\". Pointing to [[Roger Ebert]] as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood the films (Ebert wrote that during a screening of ''Friday the 13th Part 2'', he noticed that the audience had no sympathy for the victims and cheered during death scenes), Karnick explains that Ebert's remarks show how the film series forces \"audiences to experience the very thing that motivates the murders: a lack of compassion\". In closing, Karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical, but proved that audiences \"could be just as indifferent and callous as the characters in the films\".<ref name=\"Karnick\"/>\n\n==Music==\nWhen [[Harry Manfredini]] began working on the [[Sheet music|musical score]] for the 1980 film, the decision was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be.<ref name=\"slash\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/harry.HTML |title=Slasherama interview with Harry Manfredini |publisher=Slasherama |accessdate=2007-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511052302/http://www.slasherama.com/features/harry.HTML |archivedate=2006-05-11 |df= }}</ref> Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: \"There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice.\"<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini also noted that when something ''was'' about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.\n{{Listen|filename=F13theme.ogg|pos=left|title=''Friday the 13th'' theme|description=Harry Manfredini's theme, used to identify the presence of the killer in the ''Friday the 13th'' film series|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nSince Mrs. Voorhees, the killer in the original ''Friday the 13th'', does not show up until the final reel of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence.<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini was inspired by the 1975 film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', where the shark is not seen for the majority of the film, but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience as to when the shark was present during scenes and unseen.<ref name=\"Man\">Bracke, Peter, pg. 39</ref> While listening to a piece of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] music, which contained a chorus with \"striking pronunciations\", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound for ''Friday the 13th''. He came up with the sound \"ki ki ki, ma ma ma\", based on the line \"Kill her mommy!\", which Mrs. Voorhees recites repeatedly in the final reel. The \"ki\" comes from \"kill\", and the \"ma\" from \"mommy\". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words \"harshly, distinctly, and rhythmically into a microphone\" and ran them into an echo [[reverberation]] machine.<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini finished the original score after a few weeks and recorded it in a friend's basement.<ref name=\"Man\"/> Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as \"iconographic\". Manfredini makes note of the mispronunciation of the sounds: \"Everybody thinks it's cha, cha, cha. I'm like, 'Cha, cha, cha'? What are you talking about?\"<ref name=\"ReturntoCrystalLake\">{{cite video|people=Victor Miller, Jay Keuper, Harry Manfredini|title=\"Return to Crystal Lake: Making of Friday the 13th\" ''Friday the 13th'' DVD (Special Features)|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=WB|date=1980}}</ref>\n\nWhen Manfredini returned for the first sequel, he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 70</ref> Over the course of the sequels, Manfredini loosened the philosophy that the theme should be reserved just for the killer. Manfredini describes the style of the sequels as more of a \"setting 'em up and knocking 'em down\" approach, which meant that there were more \"[[MacGuffin|McGuffins]] and red\u2011herrings\" that required the killer's theme music be played to try to trick the audience. Manfredini explains, \"The original had the real myopic approach, and then we had to start thinking of the sequels as more conventional films.\"<ref name=\"slash\"/> For ''Part 3'', Manfredini only returned to score the first and last reels of the film because he was busy with a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Jack Tillar pieced together portions of the score from the first two films to fill the remaining time for ''Part 3'', while Michael Zagar composed an opening and closing theme. Manfredini and Zagar met at the latter's apartment, where Zagar rescored the original opening theme using a disco beat. Manfredini returned for ''The Final Chapter'', and although there were similar elements to the score, everything was newly recorded for the fourth ''Friday the 13th''.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 118</ref>\n\nWhen he began work on the score for ''A New Beginning'', Manfredini created a theme just for the character of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was to suggest that there was \"madness afoot\", which he believed helped to \"'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not as you might expect\".<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 142</ref> For ''Jason Lives'', Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, \"but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves\".

This documentary discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, as well as the television series. It is narrated by [[Corey Feldman]], and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested that his work on the well-received 2010 film, ''[[Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy]]'', which documented the making of the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'']] series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, ''His Name Was Jason''.
