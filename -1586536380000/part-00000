There must be some quality of reasonableness to the apprehension on the part of the victim. If the physical contact is everyday social behaviour such as a handshake or friendly pat on the back, this is acceptable even though the victim may have a [[phobia]] although, if the defendant is aware of the psychological difficulty, this may be converted into an assault if the intention is to exploit the condition and embarrass the victim. More generally, if the defendant threatens injury tomorrow, the victim has the opportunity to take avoiding action. Thus, what is threatened must be capable of being carried out immediately. This would exclude a conditional threat. For example, if the defendant says that he would beat the living daylights out of you but for the presence of a police officer watching them both, the victim is supposed to understand that there is no immediate danger (''cf.'' ''[[Tuberville v Savage]]'''s \"If it were not assize time I would not take such language from you\"). But inequality in size can be disregarded so if a very small person threatens a very large person and it is obvious that the risk of any real injury from this attack is remote, the large person may nevertheless feel some degree of apprehension. Normally, both the one making the threat and the victim must be physically present because, otherwise, there would be no immediate danger. However, if a [[mobile phone]] is used to transmit the threat (whether orally or by [[SMS]]) and, from the words used, the victim reasonably understands that an attack is imminent, this may constitute an assault.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn ''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]''<ref>''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1968] 1 QB 439</ref> a police officer ordered the defendant to park his car and he reluctantly complied. In doing so, he accidentally drove the car on to the policeman's foot and, when asked to remove the car, said \"Fuck you, you can wait\" and turned off the ignition. Because of the steel toe cap in his boot, the policeman's foot was not in actual danger, but the Divisional Court held that this could constitute an assault. Albeit accidentally, the driver had caused his car to rest on the officer's foot. This ''[[actus reus]]'' was a continuing act and the ''[[mens rea]]'' was formed during the relevant time (see [[concurrence]]). Whether realistically or not, the officer apprehended the possibility of injury so the offence was complete.\n\nIn ''[[R v. Ireland]]'',<ref>[1998] AC 147</ref> it was found that causing a person to apprehend violence can be committed by way of action or words. ''Words'' can also mean that otherwise threatening actions are rendered not capable of being an assault, as in the case of ''[[Tuberville v. Savage]]''.<ref>(1669) 1 Mod 3, T.</ref> In that case, the plaintiff told the defendant (while putting his hand on his sword) that he would ''not'' stab him, because the circuit judge was visiting town for the local assizes. On that basis, the defendant was deemed to have known that he was not about to be injured, and it was held that no assault had been committed by the plaintiff (which would otherwise have justified the defendant's allegedly pre-emptive strike).\n\nThe \"immediacy\" requirement has been the subject of some debate.  The leading case, again, is ''R v. Ireland''. Therein, the House of Lords held that the making of silent telephone calls could amount to an assault if it caused the victim to believe that physical violence might be used against him in the immediate future. One example of \"immediacy\" adopted by the House in that case was that a man who said, \"I will be at your door in a minute or two,\" might (in the circumstances where those words amounted to a threat) be guilty of an assault.\n\nSee also ''[[R v. Constanza]]''.\n\n===''Mens rea''===\nThe ''[[mens rea]]'' is that this fear must have been caused either [[intention (criminal law)|intentionally]] or [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]]. A battery is committed when the threatened force actually results in contact to the other and that contact was caused either intentionally or recklessly.\n\n===Defences===\n\nSelf-defence is available when reasonable force is used to prevent harm to self or another.\nPrevention of a greater crime or with the purpose of aiding a lawful arrest is also known as The Public Defence. The Private Defence or defence of property also may be used as an argument. \nThese arguments are not strictly defences but justifications for a certain level of force.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/3/data.htm|title=Criminal Law Act 1967|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\n==Alternative verdict==\nThe original effect of sections 39 and 40 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] was that common assault was not available as an [[alternative verdict]] under section 6(3) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].<ref>R v Mearns [1991] 1 QB 82, 91 Cr App R 312, [1990] 3 WLR 569, [1990] 3 All ER 989, [1990] Crim LR 708, CA</ref>\n\nCommon assault is now available as an alternative verdict under section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, by virtue of section 6(3A) of that Act (which was inserted by section 11 of the [[Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]]).\n\n==Whether it is a statutory offence==\nIn ''DPP v.
