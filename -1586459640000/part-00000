The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D).

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Its major goal is the [[self-determination]] of [[Inner Mongolia]] (an [[autonomous region]] of [[China]]).\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the 1980s, [[Temtselt Shobshuud]] ({{zh|c=|Xi Haiming}}), [[Huchuntegus]] ({{zh|c=Hu Qing Te Gu Si}}), [[Wang Manglai]] ({{zh|c=Wang Man Lai}}) and [[Hada (activist)|Hada]], all students at universities in [[Hohhot]], discussed establishment of the [[Inner Mongolian People's Party]] (IMPP), a political party for Mongolians in Inner Mongolia. Later, individuals from eastern and western Inner Mongolia divided and therefore, Huchuntegus established the ''Ordos Association of Ethnic Culture'' at the [[Leagues of China|Ikh Juu League]] (now the [[Ordos City]]). Hada established the ''Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance''. Xi Haiming fled his country and established the IMPP in New York, in March, 1997.<ref>[http://www.smhric.org/news_39.htm \u201cInner Mongolian People\u2019s Party\u201d and the basic facts about its key members]</ref>\n\nThe ''Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance'' organization was  originally named \"Mongolian Culture Rescue Committee\" and Hada was elected chairman.
