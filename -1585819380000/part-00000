Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold which they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it. \n\nSuch people, who may be real but impersonated people or fictitious characters played by the [[con artist]], could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives, or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a plane crash (leaving no [[will (law)|will]] or known [[next of kin]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/consumersmarts/archives/125509.asp |title=Latest e-mail uses Alaska Airlines crash victims to scam &#124; Consumer News - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee,<ref>{{cite web|title = Zimbabwe appeal|url = http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Types_Of_Scams-Charity_Scams-Zimbabwe_appeal.htm|website = Department of Commerce - WA ScamNet|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref> and similar characters. \n\nThe money could be in the form of [[gold as an investment|gold bullion]], gold dust, money in a bank account, [[blood diamond]]s, a series of checks or bank drafts, and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to forty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a very small percentage do, enough to make the fraud worthwhile, as many millions of messages can be sent daily.\n\nTo help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents which bear official government [[rubber stamps|stamps]], and [[seal (device)|seals]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Longmore-Etheridge|first=Ann|title=Nigerian scam goes on|journal=Security Management|date=August 1996|volume=40|issue=8|page=109|id={{ProQuest|231127826}}}}</ref> 419 scammers often mention false addresses and use photographs taken from the Internet or from magazines to falsely represent themselves. Often a photograph used by a scammer is not a picture of any person involved in the scheme. Multiple \"people\" may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls many fictitious personae all used in scams.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nOnce the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as \"To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?\" or \"For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more\" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nMore delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for \"white-collar\" crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the \"transaction\", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nSometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the \"deal\" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.\n\nDuring the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a \"test\" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];<ref name=\"Netherlands\"/> the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com\u00ae|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}</ref> The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.\n\nTelephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber caf\u00e9s that serve scammers; cyber caf\u00e9s often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.<ref name=\"eat\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.<ref name=\"eat\"/>\n\nThe \"success rate\" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.<ref name=\"Dixon_Robyn\"/> If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.<ref name=\"Grinker_Roy\">{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618\u2013621|url=https://books.google.com/?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=nigerian+scam+success+rate#v=onepage&q=nigerian%20scam%20success%20rate&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of a suspicious site warning in the [[Firefox]] browser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.1/releasenotes/ |title=Firefox Release Notes|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced fee fraud.<ref name=\"EFCC\">{{cite web|title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act of 2004 |url=http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |publisher=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Nigeria) |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628080831/http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref> In 2009, Nigeria's EFCC announced that they have adopted smart technology developed by [[Microsoft]] to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed \"Eagle Claw\", running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.<ref name=\"AFP_2009\"/>\n\nSome individuals participate in a practice known as [[scam baiting]], in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer's time and decrease the time they have available for real victims.<ref name=\"Cheng_Jacqui\">{{cite news|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Baiting Nigerian scammers for fun (not so much for profit).|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/05/baiting-nigerian-scammers-for-fun-not-so-much-for-profit/|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 11, 2009}}</ref> Details on the practice of scam baiting, and ideas, are chronicled on a website, [[419eater.com]], launched in 2003 by Michael Berry. One particularly notable case of scam baiting involved an American who identified himself to a Nigerian scammer as [[James T. Kirk]]. When the scammer \u2014 who apparently had never heard of the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' \u2014 asked for his passport details, \"Kirk\" sent a copy of a fake passport with a photo of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s Captain Kirk, hoping the scammer would attempt to use it and get arrested.<ref name=\"Corbin_Jane\">{{cite news|last=Corbin|first=Jane|title=A mysterious email and a split-second mistake: That's all it took for internet gangsters to hijack my life...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1243634/A-mysterious-email-split-second-mistake-Thats-took-internet-gangsters-hijack-life-.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=January 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Common elements==\n===Irreversible money transfers===\nA central element of advance-fee fraud is the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.\n\nWire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.\n\n===Anonymous communication===\nSince the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.\n\n====Web-based email====\nBecause many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.\n\n====Email hijacking/friend scams====\nSome fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&en=597277d1a0cbde58&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.\n\n====Fax transmissions====\n[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.\n\n====SMS messages====\nAbusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]]. \n\nThese messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.\n\nA recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.\n\n====Telecommunications relay services====\nMany scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.\n\nFCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nTracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.\n\nTRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.\n\n===Invitation to visit the country===\nSometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom.

Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.\n\n===Employment scams===\nThis scam targets people who have posted their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a \"work permit\" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) \"government official\" to contact. The \"government official\" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.\n\nMany legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior \"registration fee\", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a \"work-at-home\" opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a \"mystery shopper\", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it\u2014banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false\u2014 and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.\n\n====Bogus job offers====\nMore sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job? Security at work-applicant sites faulted|last=Menn|first=Joseph|date=2007-11-09|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother form of employment scam involves making people receive a fake \"interview\" where they are told the benefits of the company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When \"given\" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of \"training\".<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.<ref name=\"Kliot\">{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Cash-handling scam====\nThese scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on Job Search sites. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common email account such as \"Yahoo\", asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an \"Instant Messenger\" chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with \"canned responses\" in broken English.\n\nAt the \"Instant Messenger\" stage, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a \"scammer\" and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.\n\nThe scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.\n\nAnother form of the scam is the \"Representative/Collection Agent\" variation wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for \"Representative or Collection Agent\" for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from \"customers\" into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.\n\n===Lottery scam===\n{{Main|Lottery scam}}\nThe lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The \"winner\" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.\n\nThe [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.\n\nIn 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Online sales and rentals===\nMany scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.<ref name=\"Fraudguides\">{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.<ref name=\"Grant_Bob\">{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Bob|title=Another fake conference?|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56185/|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=November 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them.<ref name=\"Sichelman_Lew\">{{cite news|last=Sichelman|first=Lew|title=Rental scams can target either landlords or tenants|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/25/business/la-fi-lew-20120325|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 25, 2012}}</ref> Or the [[con artist]] finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit.<ref name=\"Aho_Karen\">{{cite news|last=Aho|first=Karen|title=Renters: Beware of new twists on an old scam|url=http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[MSN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090312/http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving. Once the terms are negotiated, a forged check is forwarded for a greater amount than negotiated, and the fraudster asks the landlord to wire some of the money back.<ref name=\"McKee_Chris\">{{cite news|last=McKee |first=Chris |title=Room rental internet scam takes Eugene college students for thousands |url=http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[KMTR]] |date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120215930/http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |archivedate=November 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Pet scams===\nThis is a variation of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are advertised as bait on online advertising websites using little real seller verification like [[Craigslist]], [[Gumtree]], and [[Junk Mail Digital Media|JunkMail]]. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nNumerous scam websites may be used for this scam. This scam has been linked to the classical 419 scams in that the fictitious couriers used, as are also used in other types of 419 scams such as lotto scams.\n\n===Romance scam===\n{{Main|Romance scam}}\n\nOne of the variants is the ''Romance Scam'', a money-for-romance angle.<ref name=\"KMBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kmbc.com/money/9246998/detail.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719002945/http://www.kmbc.com/money/9246998/detail.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-19|title=Online Romance Scams Continue To Grow - Project Economy News Story|publisher=Kmbc.com|date=2006-05-19|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> The con artist approaches the victim on an [[online dating service]], an [[instant messenger]], or a social networking site.

In other cases, they claim they're trapped in a foreign country and need assistance to return, to escape imprisonment by corrupt local officials, to pay for medical expenses due to an illness contracted abroad, and so on.<ref name=\"Seduce2\"/> The scammer may also use the confidence gained by the romance angle to introduce some variant of the original Nigerian Letter scheme,<ref name=\"Seduce2\"/> such as saying they need to get money or valuables out of the country and offer to share the wealth, making the request for help in leaving the country even more attractive to the victim. \n\nScams often involve meeting someone on an online match-making service.<ref name=\"KMBC\"/> The scammer initiates contact with their target who is out of the area and requests money for transportation fare.<ref name=\"Seduce2\"/> Scammers will typically ask for money to be sent via a [[money order]] or [[wire transfer]] due to the need to travel, or for medical or business costs.<ref name=\"romance_scam\">{{cite news|title=Attorney general: Beware of romance scams on Valentine's Day.|url=http://www.sent-trib.com/news/attorney-general-beware-of-romance-scams-on-valentine-s-day/article_45ec84ba-f060-11e6-9e53-738933627fec.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Sentinel-Tribune|date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen a victim travels to a meeting, it can have deadly consequence as in the case of Jette Jacobs, 67, from Australia.

Her body was discovered on February 9, 2013, under mysterious circumstances, two days after meeting up with Omokoh. Omokoh has fled back to Nigeria. After questioning in Nigeria, Omokoh was arrested.

The fraudster uses Internet classified websites and print media to lure the public for installation of mobile towers on their property. The fraudster also creates fake websites to appear legitimate. The victims part with their money in pieces to the fraudster on account of the Government Service Tax, government clearance charges, bank charges, transportation charges, survey fee etc. The Indian government is issuing public notices in media to spread awareness among the public and warn them against mobile tower fraudsters.<ref>{{cite web|title = Measures to Protect Consumer Interest - Consumer Info: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|url = http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|website = www.trai.gov.in|access-date = 2016-02-20|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212020852/http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Mass Marketing Frauds in the garb of Mobile Towers in India: Evolving a Framework to handle it|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294219016|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|doi = 10.13140/RG.2.1.4630.2480|last = Kumar|first = Harish|year = 2016}}</ref> This fraud is widespread in India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://propakistani.pk/2010/10/09/fraud-of-the-year-minting-money-by-acquiring-land-for-towers/|title=Fraud of the Year: Minting Money by Acquiring Land for Towers|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Villagers-fall-prey-to-mobile-tower-scam/articleshow/47697564.cms|title=Villagers fall prey to mobile tower scam - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===Other scams===\nOther scams involve unclaimed property, also called \"[[bona vacantia]]\" in the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[England and Wales]] (other than the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]), this property is administered by the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor's Department.

This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or \"[[pigeon]]\", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an [[accomplice]]).<ref name=\"Zak_Paul\">{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|title=How to Run a Con|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-moral-molecule/200811/how-run-con|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers will go after the victims of previous scams; known as a [[reloading scam]]. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim, for a price.

The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold which they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it. \n\nSuch people, who may be real but impersonated people or fictitious characters played by the [[con artist]], could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives, or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a plane crash (leaving no [[will (law)|will]] or known [[next of kin]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/consumersmarts/archives/125509.asp |title=Latest e-mail uses Alaska Airlines crash victims to scam &#124; Consumer News - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee,<ref>{{cite web|title = Zimbabwe appeal|url = http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Types_Of_Scams-Charity_Scams-Zimbabwe_appeal.htm|website = Department of Commerce - WA ScamNet|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref> and similar characters. \n\nThe money could be in the form of [[gold as an investment|gold bullion]], gold dust, money in a bank account, [[blood diamond]]s, a series of checks or bank drafts, and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to forty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a very small percentage do, enough to make the fraud worthwhile, as many millions of messages can be sent daily.\n\nTo help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents which bear official government [[rubber stamps|stamps]], and [[seal (device)|seals]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Longmore-Etheridge|first=Ann|title=Nigerian scam goes on|journal=Security Management|date=August 1996|volume=40|issue=8|page=109|id={{ProQuest|231127826}}}}</ref> 419 scammers often mention false addresses and use photographs taken from the Internet or from magazines to falsely represent themselves. Often a photograph used by a scammer is not a picture of any person involved in the scheme. Multiple \"people\" may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls many fictitious personae all used in scams.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nOnce the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as \"To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?\" or \"For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more\" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nMore delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for \"white-collar\" crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the \"transaction\", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nSometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the \"deal\" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.\n\nDuring the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a \"test\" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];<ref name=\"Netherlands\"/> the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com\u00ae|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}</ref> The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/> However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.\n\nTelephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.<ref name=\"usembassy\"/>\n\nThe spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber caf\u00e9s that serve scammers; cyber caf\u00e9s often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.<ref name=\"eat\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nNigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.<ref name=\"eat\"/>\n\nThe \"success rate\" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.<ref name=\"Dixon_Robyn\"/> If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.<ref name=\"Grinker_Roy\">{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618\u2013621|url=https://books.google.com/?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=nigerian+scam+success+rate#v=onepage&q=nigerian%20scam%20success%20rate&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n[[File:Firefox 2.0.0.1 Phising Alert.png|thumb|Screenshot of a suspicious site warning in the [[Firefox]] browser<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.1/releasenotes/ |title=Firefox Release Notes|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>]]\nIn recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams.

Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.\n\nWire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.\n\n===Anonymous communication===\nSince the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.\n\n====Web-based email====\nBecause many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.\n\n====Email hijacking/friend scams====\nSome fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&en=597277d1a0cbde58&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.\n\n====Fax transmissions====\n[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.\n\n====SMS messages====\nAbusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]]. \n\nThese messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.\n\nA recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.\n\n====Telecommunications relay services====\nMany scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.\n\nFCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\nTracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.\n\nTRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.\n\n===Invitation to visit the country===\nSometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need  a [[visa (document)|visa]], or that the scammers will provide one.<ref name=\"StateDeptPub10465\">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/2189.pdf |author=United States Department of State |title=Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud (DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 10465) |date=April 1997 |access-date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=State Dept.

Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.\n\n===Employment scams===\nThis scam targets people who have posted their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a \"work permit\" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) \"government official\" to contact. The \"government official\" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.\n\nMany legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior \"registration fee\", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a \"work-at-home\" opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a \"mystery shopper\", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it\u2014banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false\u2014 and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.\n\n====Bogus job offers====\nMore sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}</ref> A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job? Security at work-applicant sites faulted|last=Menn|first=Joseph|date=2007-11-09|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother form of employment scam involves making people receive a fake \"interview\" where they are told the benefits of the company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When \"given\" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of \"training\".<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.<ref name=\"Kliot\">{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Cash-handling scam====\nThese scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on Job Search sites. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common email account such as \"Yahoo\", asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an \"Instant Messenger\" chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with \"canned responses\" in broken English.\n\nAt the \"Instant Messenger\" stage, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a \"scammer\" and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.\n\nThe scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.\n\nAnother form of the scam is the \"Representative/Collection Agent\" variation wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for \"Representative or Collection Agent\" for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from \"customers\" into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.\n\n===Lottery scam===\n{{Main|Lottery scam}}\nThe lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The \"winner\" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.\n\nThe [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.\n\nIn 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Online sales and rentals===\nMany scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.<ref name=\"Fraudguides\">{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.<ref name=\"Grant_Bob\">{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Bob|title=Another fake conference?|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56185/|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=November 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them.<ref name=\"Sichelman_Lew\">{{cite news|last=Sichelman|first=Lew|title=Rental scams can target either landlords or tenants|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/25/business/la-fi-lew-20120325|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 25, 2012}}</ref> Or the [[con artist]] finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit.<ref name=\"Aho_Karen\">{{cite news|last=Aho|first=Karen|title=Renters: Beware of new twists on an old scam|url=http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[MSN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090312/http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving. Once the terms are negotiated, a forged check is forwarded for a greater amount than negotiated, and the fraudster asks the landlord to wire some of the money back.<ref name=\"McKee_Chris\">{{cite news|last=McKee |first=Chris |title=Room rental internet scam takes Eugene college students for thousands |url=http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[KMTR]] |date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120215930/http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |archivedate=November 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Pet scams===\nThis is a variation of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are advertised as bait on online advertising websites using little real seller verification like [[Craigslist]], [[Gumtree]], and [[Junk Mail Digital Media|JunkMail]]. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUpon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nNumerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.<ref name=\"Herb_Weisbaum\">{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nNumerous scam websites may be used for this scam.

The fraudster uses Internet classified websites and print media to lure the public for installation of mobile towers on their property. The fraudster also creates fake websites to appear legitimate. The victims part with their money in pieces to the fraudster on account of the Government Service Tax, government clearance charges, bank charges, transportation charges, survey fee etc. The Indian government is issuing public notices in media to spread awareness among the public and warn them against mobile tower fraudsters.<ref>{{cite web|title = Measures to Protect Consumer Interest - Consumer Info: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|url = http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|website = www.trai.gov.in|access-date = 2016-02-20|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212020852/http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Mass Marketing Frauds in the garb of Mobile Towers in India: Evolving a Framework to handle it|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294219016|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|doi = 10.13140/RG.2.1.4630.2480|last = Kumar|first = Harish|year = 2016}}</ref> This fraud is widespread in India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://propakistani.pk/2010/10/09/fraud-of-the-year-minting-money-by-acquiring-land-for-towers/|title=Fraud of the Year: Minting Money by Acquiring Land for Towers|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Villagers-fall-prey-to-mobile-tower-scam/articleshow/47697564.cms|title=Villagers fall prey to mobile tower scam - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===Other scams===\nOther scams involve unclaimed property, also called \"[[bona vacantia]]\" in the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[England and Wales]] (other than the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]), this property is administered by the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor's Department. Fraudulent emails and letters claiming to be from this department have been reported, informing the recipient they are the beneficiary of a legacy but requiring the payment of a fee before sending more information or releasing the money.<ref name=\"Bona_Vacantia\">{{cite web|title=Scam Email Warnings. |url=http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/scam-email-warning.aspx |publisher=Bona Vacantia |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712102227/http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/scam-email-warning.aspx |archivedate=July 12, 2012 }}</ref> In the [[United States]], messages are falsely claimed to be from the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), a real organization, but one that does not and cannot itself make payments.<ref name=\"Leamy_Elisabeth\">{{cite news|last=Leamy|first=Elisabeth|title=Beware of Unclaimed Money Scams|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/beware-unclaimed-money-scam/story?id=14293877#.T-aW4StYuxI|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn one variant of 419 fraud, an alleged [[hitman]] writes to someone explaining he has been targeted to kill them. He tells them he knows the allegations against them are false, and asks for money so the target can receive evidence of the person who ordered the hit.<ref name=\"Snopes_Hitman\">{{cite web|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=Hitman Scam.|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/hitman.asp|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of advanced fee fraud is known as a pigeon drop. This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or \"[[pigeon]]\", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an [[accomplice]]).<ref name=\"Zak_Paul\">{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|title=How to Run a Con|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-moral-molecule/200811/how-run-con|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome scammers will go after the victims of previous scams; known as a [[reloading scam]]. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim, for a price. Or they may say a fund has been set up by the Nigerian government to compensate victims of 419 fraud, and all that is required is proof of the loss, personal information, and a processing and handling fee. The recovery scammers obtain lists of victims by buying them from the original scammers.<ref name=\"Snopes_Victim_Scam\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Mikkelson|title=Scam Me Twice, Shame On Me, ...|url=https://www.snopes.com/scam-me-twice-shame-on-me/|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nEstimates of the total losses due to the scam are uncertain and vary widely, since many people may be too embarrassed to admit that they were gullible enough to be scammed to report the crime.

The University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Phoenix was initially established as a branch campus in 2007, but became an independent medical school in 2012.<ref name=\"medicine.arizona.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/about-college/campuses|title=Campuses|website=University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>  The College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson campus is located at the University of Arizona Health Sciences (UAHS) center on the campus of the [[University of Arizona]] and is governed by the Arizona Board of Regents. Traditionally, the college accepted Arizona residents exclusively. However, beginning the 2009\u20132010 incoming class, the school changed its policy to allow for admission of \"highly-qualified,\" non-residents.<ref>[http://www.admissions.medicine.arizona.edu/]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe College of Medicine at the [[University of Arizona]] was founded in 1967 with an initial class of 32 students. It has since grown to enroll approximately 125 students annually and has graduated over 4,000 physicians since its inception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/about-college/history|title=History|website=University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the early 1990s, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] program was established to allow the school's 3rd and 4th year medical students to complete clinical clerkships at Phoenix-area hospitals. In August 2007, a 4-year branch campus was founded at the [[Phoenix Biomedical Campus]] (PBC), on the former site of the historic [[Phoenix Union High School]], and its inaugural class of 24 students was admitted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/timeline|title=College Timeline|date=2014-12-22|newspaper=The University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Phoenix|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en}}</ref> In 2012, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) granted preliminary accreditation to the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix]] and the recruitment and admissions processes for the two colleges are now independent.<ref name=\"medicine.arizona.edu\"/> Though the Phoenix campus began as collaboration between the University of Arizona, [[Arizona State University]], and the neighboring [[Translational Genomics Research Institute]], Arizona State University pulled out of the partnership in April 2010, citing state budget cuts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uanews.org/node/31043|title=Arizona State University to Withdraw From Partnership With University of Arizona on College of Medicine-Phoenix|newspaper=UANews|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> Both colleges are now associated solely with the [[University of Arizona]].\n\nIn 1974, the University of Arizona received $5.5 million from the [[Arizona State Legislature]] to renovate its football stadium. A provision of this legislation (ARS 15-1630) prohibited the school's associated [[academic medical center]], then known as [[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|University Medical Center]] from performing abortions (unless the mother's life was in jeopardy) or teaching its medical students about various [[abortion]] procedures. This legislation is still in effect for every public medical school in Arizona, making Arizona the only state which prohibits the teaching of abortion in public universities. To address this issue, [[Planned Parenthood]] implemented a rotation for [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] (Ob/Gyn) residents to receive abortion training to meet [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) requirements. Residents and medical students have thus maintained the ability to study the medical and surgical abortion procedures necessary to complete their training. Second and third year [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Ob/Gyn]] residents have scheduled time available to pursue training. Medical students may pursue training on an elective basis.\n\n==Medical education==\nThe standard curriculum is a four-year program which currently graduates approximately 135 students per year.<ref name=\"facts-figures\">{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/admissions/why-ua/facts-figures|title=Facts and Figures|website=University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>\n\nClasses for the first two years are graded on a Pass/Fail basis. In the last two years, students complete clinical clerkships at a number of Tucson-area hospitals and have the option to rotate in Phoenix as well. Grades for the last two years are assigned on a Pass/Fail/Honors basis. This system is similar to the curriculum of most other schools medical schools. The college also offers three dual degree programs: a joint [[MD\u2013PhD|MD/PhD]], [[Professional degrees of public health|Masters of Public Health]] (MD/MPH), and [[Master of Business Administration|Masters of Business Administration]] (MD/MBA) degree through the College of Medicine, the [[Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health]], and the [[Eller College of Management]], respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medicine.arizona.edu/education/graduate/dual-degree-md|title=Dual Degree MD Programs|website=University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|language=en|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Admissions and rankings==\nAdmission to the College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson is very competitive with nearly 10,000 applicants vying for 120 spots for the 2022 graduating class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tucson.com/news/local/applications-to-medical-school-in-tucson-reach-record-high/article_aa855c4c-0a05-5538-858b-34c71c6fa0d1.html|title=Applications to Medical School in Tucson Reach Record High|website=Arizona Daily Star|language=en|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref> Beginning in the 2009\u20132010 admissions cycle, the school began to accept \"extremely qualified\" out of state applicants with a cap of 25% of the incoming class.

The University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Phoenix was initially established as a branch campus in 2007, but became an independent medical school in 2012.<ref name=\"medicine.arizona.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/about-college/campuses|title=Campuses {{!}} College of Medicine - Tucson|website=medicine.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>  The College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson campus is located at the University of Arizona Health Sciences (UAHS) center on the campus of the [[University of Arizona]] and is governed by the Arizona Board of Regents. Traditionally, the college accepted Arizona residents exclusively. However, beginning the 2009-2010 incoming class, the school changed its policy to allow for admission of \"highly-qualified,\" non-residents.<ref>[http://www.admissions.medicine.arizona.edu/]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe College of Medicine at the [[University of Arizona]] was founded in 1967 with an initial class of 32 students. It has since grown to enroll approximately 125 students annually and has graduated over 4,000 physicians since its inception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/about-college/history|title=History {{!}} College of Medicine - Tucson|website=medicine.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the early 1990s, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] program was established to allow the school's 3rd and 4th year medical students to complete clinical clerkships at Phoenix-area hospitals. In August 2007, a 4-year branch campus was founded at the [[Phoenix Biomedical Campus]] (PBC), on the former site of the historic [[Phoenix Union High School]], and its inaugural class of 24 students was admitted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/timeline|title=College Timeline|date=2014-12-22|newspaper=The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en}}</ref> In 2012, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) granted preliminary accreditation to the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix]] and the recruitment and admissions processes for the two colleges are now independent.<ref name=\"medicine.arizona.edu\"/> Though the Phoenix campus began as collaboration between the University of Arizona, [[Arizona State University]], and the neighboring [[Translational Genomics Research Institute]], Arizona State University pulled out of the partnership in April 2010, citing state budget cuts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uanews.org/node/31043|title=Arizona State University to Withdraw From Partnership With University of Arizona on College of Medicine-Phoenix|newspaper=UANews|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> Both colleges are now associated solely with the [[University of Arizona]].\n\nIn 1974, the University of Arizona received $5.5 million from the [[Arizona State Legislature|Arizona state legislature]] to renovate its football stadium. A provision of this legislation (ARS 15-1630) prohibited the school's associated [[Academic Medical Center|academic medical center]], then known as [[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|University Medical Center]] from performing abortions (unless the mother's life was in jeopardy) or teaching its medical students about various [[abortion]] procedures. This legislation is still in effect for every public medical school in Arizona, making Arizona the only state which prohibits the teaching of abortion in public universities. To address this issue, [[Planned Parenthood]] implemented a rotation for [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] (Ob/Gyn) residents to receive abortion training to meet [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) requirements. Residents and medical students have thus maintained the ability to study the medical and surgical abortion procedures necessary to complete their training. Second and third year [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Ob/Gyn]] residents have scheduled time available to pursue training. Medical students may pursue training on an elective basis.\n\n==Medical education==\nThe standard curriculum is a four-year program which currently graduates approximately 135 students per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/admissions/why-ua/facts-figures|title=Facts and Figures {{!}} College of Medicine - Tucson|website=medicine.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref>\n\nClasses for the first two years are graded on a Pass/Fail basis. In the last two years, students complete clinical clerkships at a number of Tucson-area hospitals and have the option to rotate in Phoenix as well. Grades for the last two years are assigned on a Pass/Fail/Honors basis. This system is similar to the curriculum of most other schools medical schools. The college also offers three dual degree programs: a joint [[MD\u2013PhD|MD/PhD]], [[Professional degrees of public health|Masters of Public Health]] (MD/MPH), and [[Master of Business Administration|Masters of Business Administration]] (MD/MBA) degree through the College of Medicine, the [[Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health]], and the [[Eller College of Management]], respectively. <ref>{{Cit web|url=https://medicine.arizona.edu/education/graduate/dual-degree-md|title=Dual Degree MD Programs {{!}} College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|website=medicine.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Admissions and rankings==\nAdmission to the College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson is very competitive with nearly 10,000 applicants vying for 120 spots for the 2022 graduating class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tucson.com/news/local/applications-to-medical-school-in-tucson-reach-record-high/article_aa855c4c-0a05-5538-858b-34c71c6fa0d1.html|title=Applications to Medical School in Tucson Reach Record High {{!}} The Arizona Daily Star|website=tucson.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref> Beginning in the 2009-2010 admissions cycle, the school began to accept \"extremely qualified\" out of state applicants with a cap of 25% of the incoming class. Starting in the 2011-2012 cycle, this cap was raised to 50% due to the increased number of seats at the recently established Phoenix campus. The College of Medicine, like most medical schools across the country, does not allow international students unless recommended by a faculty of the college and approved by the Dean under very special circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/sites/medicine.arizona.edu/files/uploads/education/tuc/Information%20for%20International%20Students.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|website=medicine.arizona.edu|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> The average GPA and MCAT for the Class of 2018 was 3.7 and 30.5 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.arizona.edu/admissions/why-ua/facts-figures|title=Facts and Figures {{!}} College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson|website=medicine.arizona.edu|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> Starting in the 2010-2011 admissions cycle, the [[American Medical College Application Service]] (AMCAS) separated the application process between Phoenix and Tucson, allowing students to apply for these campuses separately.\n\nIn 2017, ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranked the University of Arizona College of Medicine #74 for [[primary care]] and #63 for research.
