The series follows the adventures of [[Timmy Turner]], a 10-year-old boy with two [[fairy godparent]]s named Cosmo and Wanda. He is constantly at odds with his 16-year-old babysitter Vicky, with whom his parents are oblivious to her malevolent doings against their son. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] (2001\u20132017), [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]], and Billionfold Inc. (2008\u20132017).\n\nThe series originated from shorts on Nick's animation showcase, ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', that aired from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a half-hour series on March 30, 2001, due to its popularity. Originally, it ended on November 25, 2006, totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. Production of the series ceased again after Hartman left Nickelodeon in February 2018.<ref name=\"leave1\">{{cite web|last=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-978368492/why-i-left-nickelodeon|via=SoundCloud|date=February 9, 2018|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"leave2\">{{cite web|last1=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4faDISwSVo|website=YouTube|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Premise===\nSet in the fictional town of Dimmsdale, [[California]], ''The Fairly OddParents'' tells the story of a 10-year-old boy named Timmy Turner who is neglected by his parents and tortured by his babysitter, Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes usually backfire or cause a series of problems that Timmy must fix. Earlier episodes of the series tend to revolve around Timmy trying to navigate his everyday life at home, at school or elsewhere in town with his best friends, Chester and A.J. or occasionally his parents, while also trying to fix a wish gone awry and ultimately, learning a lesson in the end. Later in the series, Timmy wishes that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof. Much later in the series, Timmy gets a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Even later in the series, Timmy is informed that due to a shortage of available fairies, he must now share Cosmo and Wanda with his neighbor, Chloe Carmichael, who is essentially his polar opposite. Chloe loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Vicky was the main antagonist, but as the series progressed, many more villains were introduced, including: Denzel Crocker, Timmy's mentally-ill teacher who wishes to prove the world that fairies exist; The school bully, Francis; Remy Buxaplenty, a young billionaire child with a fairy godparent who is set on getting rid of Timmy's fairy godparents due to his immense jealousy towards him for having two fairy godparents compared to his one; Dark Laser, a parody of [[Darth Vader]], who wants to destroy Timmy and the Earth; The Pixies, who are known to wield as much power as fairies, but they treat their magical powers like a business. The Pixie's primary goal is to take control of Fairy World and the Earth; The Anti-fairies, who are similar to the actual fairies, but with polar opposite personalities and character traits. Anti-fairies are also known for causing bad luck; and Norm the Genie, who hatches plans to gain freedom from his lamp and get revenge on Timmy.\n\n===Setting===\n''The Fairly OddParents'' is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. Dimmsdale has a sign on some mountains near the city that is a parody of the [[Hollywood Sign]]. In the episode, \"Vicky Loses Her Icky\", the Mayor of Dimmsdale unveils the \"Welcome to Dimmsdale - Nicest Town on Earth!\" sign. However, at the end of the episode, the President of the United States changes the word \u201cNicest\u201d to \u201cMeanest\u201d. Dimmsdale appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings, skyscrapers and a city hall, but also containing uptown areas with suburban residences (including the neighborhood where Timmy, his parents and his friends live) and businesses, such as Timmy's school; a hospital; a jail; a sports complex called, \u201cThe Dimmadome\u201d, which is named after its founder and owner, Doug Dimmadome; a local TV channel and various restaurants and stores, as well as a park in the center of the city. Dimmsdale also appears to have rural farmland located outside of the city. The adults who live in Dimmsdale are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still manage to form a working and functioning society. In the episode, \"Which Witch is Which?\", it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1630s and named after a man called Dale Dimm.\n\nWhen the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the home of the fairies, which is a floating world located on top of some clouds and colored with an abundance of pink and purple. Fairy World is depicted as a large metropolis with houses, streets, different kinds of buildings and skyscrapers. Most buildings in Fairy World have crowns or stars above their roofs. The fairies have a civilization like that of humans, but with their primary source of power being magic, which also keeps their world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth, although the bridge seems to exist only for decoration since fairies teleport via magic to and from Earth. Fairy World is not actually a part of Earth but is depicted as a separate world in outer space located near Earth's orbit that can only be accessed by magic. Among the most notable landmarks in Fairy World is the glowing entrance sign on the other side of the rainbow bridge and the giant wand located in the center of Fairy World that powers the fairies' magic. Jorgen Von Strangle, who acts as the leader of the fairies and Fairy World is an enormous and tough fairy with an [[Austrian accent]], similar to that of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Jorgen personally dislikes Timmy at the beginning of the series but warms up to him over time.\n\nAnother location seen in the show is the city of Chincinatti, the home town of Timmy's favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the Anti-fairies reside; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the Pixies; and Yugopotamia, another planet where Timmy's alien friend, Mark Chang, lived until the episode \u201cNew Squid in Town!\u201d when Timmy invites Mark to live in the Dimmsdale junkyard in order to escape his evil fianc\u00e9e, Princess Mandie.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Fairly OddParents characters}}\n<!-- http://www.nick.com/shows/fairly-oddparents/characters/timmy-turner.html -->\n* [[Tara Strong]] as [[Timmy Tiberius Turner|Timmy Turner]], [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Poof|Poof]]\n* [[Daran Norris]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Cosmo|Cosmo]]\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Wanda|Wanda]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Vicky|Vicky]]\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Denzel Crocker|Denzel Crocker]]\n* [[Matthew W.

In 1997, [[Fred Seibert]] contacted Hartman about pitching ideas for his ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' series which he was developing for [[Nickelodeon]], Hartman initially declined the offer. Several months later, ''Johnny Bravo'' finished and Hartman decided to create his own series instead of going back to working for other studios.<ref name=\"Nickelodeon podcast\">{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=29oy4OZgMKQ|title=Episode 10: Butch Hartman|date=July 8, 2016|publisher=[[Nickelodeon Animation Podcast]]}}</ref>\n{{Quote box | quote=\"I wanted initially to do a boy version of ''Cinderella''.

Instead, he decided to give Timmy a magic friend.

Hartman then went back to Seibert at Nickelodeon and successfully pitched it to them for ''Oh Yeah! Cartoons''.<ref name=\"Nickelodeon podcast\"/>\n\nWhile in early development, the series was titled ''The Fairy GodParents'' and then it was briefly changed to ''Oh My GodParents''.<ref name=\"107 More Facts\"/> [[Bill Burnett (writer)|Bill Burnett]] came up with the title ''The Fairly OddParents'', which they ended up sticking with.<ref name=\"107 Facts\">{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz2ymPiCd4I|title=107 Facts About The Fairly OddParents Cartoon Hangover|date=January 20, 2016|publisher=[[Channel Frederator Network|Cartoon Hangover]]}}</ref> Hartman originally created ''The Fairly OddParents'' as a seven-minute [[short film]], which was one of the thirty-nine short cartoons created for ''Oh Yeah!

Cartoons'': ''[[ChalkZone]]'' and ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]''. On 2000, Nickelodeon ordered seven twenty-three-minute episodes for the series' first season, which premiered on March 30, 2001<ref name=\"107 Facts\"/> in the half-hour before fellow Nicktoon ''[[Invader Zim]]'' made its debut.<ref name=\"fishbowl\">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E7D8133CF936A15750C0A9679C8B63|title=Fishbowl Fairies and an Alien in Exile|first=Kathryn|last=Shattuck|date=March 15, 2001|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the later series, the animation in the original shorts is not as smooth and the designs are notably different (including Timmy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky's abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include the voices like Timmy Turner, who was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] rather than Tara Strong. Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series while Wanda is shown to be ditzy. Vicky is also much less evil than in the current series; she also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used \"twerp\".\n\nInitially, Hartman wanted Timmy to wear a blue hat, but he changed it to pink after his blue marker ran out of ink.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzr3A7Sz474|title=Fun Facts About My Shows: The Fairly OddParents, Danny Phantom & TUFF Puppy!|date=September 1, 2015|publisher=Butch Hartman}}</ref> Additionally, Wanda was originally going to have blue hair, but it was also changed to pink so that it wouldn't clash with Timmy's bedroom walls.<ref name=\"107 More Facts\">{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w9G7sCtYqKs|title=107 MORE The Fairly OddParents Facts YOU Should Know!

Mainly because sometimes the network, Nickelodeon, wants us to add things and so we add things, but we try to add things in a way that makes the show better, not worse.\" \u2014 Butch Hartman<ref name=\"Then Vs Now\"/>\n | align=left\n | width=25em\n}}\nThe [[The Fairly OddParents (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''The Fairly OddParents'' began with a special called ''The Big Fairy Share Scare!'', which introduced another new main character named Chloe Carmichael, Timmy's neighbor who he is forced to share Cosmo and Wanda with due to a fairy shortage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/entertainment/the-10th-season-of-butch-hartmans-fairly-oddparents-is-as-crazy-as-ever/2016/01/13/515272ec-ba2e-11e5-85cd-5ad59bc19432_video.html|title=The 10th season of Butch Hartman's 'Fairly OddParents' is as crazy as ever|date=January 13, 2016|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The tenth season aired from January 15, 2016, to July 26, 2017, on both [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]]. The visuals and lyrics for the theme song were changed for season ten in order to include Chloe; however, it still contained the same rhythm and melody as the original theme song.<ref name=\"Then Vs Now\"/> Also in season 10, the show's animation made the transition from [[traditional animation]] to [[Flash animation]]. The animation for season ten was done by Elliot Animation Studios in Canada, whereas all of the prior seasons were animated by Yeson Animation Studios in South Korea.<ref name=\"Then Vs Now\"/> Sparky was completely absent from season ten, with no in-universe explanation for his disappearance. Poof was absent throughout most of season 10 as well, but returned in the episode \"Certifiable Super Sitter\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Fairly OddParents episodes}}\n{{: List of The Fairly OddParents episodes#Series overview}}\n\n==Cancelled spin-off series and film==\nIn 2004, Hartman revealed his intentions to make a ''Crash Nebula'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series. The [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] \"Crash Nebula\" was aired as part of the show's [[The Fairly OddParents (season 4)|fourth season]]. Despite this, [[Nickelodeon]] decided not to pick up the episode as a series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manic-expression.com/top-5-rejected-nickelodeon-shows-or-pilots-that-should-never-be-made/|title=Top 5 Rejected Nickelodeon Shows or Pilots That Should Never Be Made|date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> However in 2006, Hartman stated that he was still confident and would try to get the spin-off greenlighted in the future. He also wrote a script entitled ''Crash Nebula: The Movie'' for [[Paramount Pictures]], but the film was canceled due to its similarities with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-fairly-oddparents/crash-nebula-321929/trivia/|title=The Fairly OddParents: Crash Nebula|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 or 2006, Hartman had also considered making a theatrical [[film adaptation]] of the series after its initial cancellation in 2006, to be produced by [[Nickelodeon Movies]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was to be animated much like the series as well as previous Nickelodeon fare such as the [[Rugrats (film series)|''Rugrats'' trilogy]] and ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', but was scrapped due to [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|a management change at Paramount]] although the script was already written. Despite this, Hartman expressed interest in releasing the film [[Direct-to-video|for DVD]] someday, and stated that the script could serve for another [[TV movie]] of the show. The series stopped production after the last episode aired on July 26, 2017 and Butch Hartman left Nickelodeon in early 2018 before moving to [[Sony Pictures Animation]] to plan any direct-to-video sequels to the original film,<ref name=\"leave1\" /><ref name=\"leave2\" /> seemingly ending any chances of the film happening. Despite several TV films, The Fairly OddParents is the longest running series on the network to not receive a theatrical film release.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/butch-hartman-pocketwatch-hobbykidstv-1202584593/|title='Fairly OddParents' Creator Butch Hartman Developing Three Series With Startup Pocket.watch|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=October 17, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Main|List of The Fairly OddParents home video releases}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nBetsy Wallace from [[Common Sense Media]] gave the series 3 of 5 stars saying, \u201cNickelodeon airs some of the most creative and expertly animated cartoons on television, and it has another winner with ''The Fairly OddParents''.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/the-fairly-oddparents|title=The Fairly OddParents review|first=Betsy|last=Wallace|publisher=Common Sense Media|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nDennis Cass from ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' favorably compared the series' writing to that of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and praised the series' broad appeal.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The series follows the adventures of [[Timmy Turner]], a 10-year-old boy with two [[fairy godparent]]s named Cosmo and Wanda. He is constantly at odds with his 16-year-old babysitter Vicky, with whom his parents are oblivious to her malevolent doings against their son. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] (2001\u20132017), [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]], and Billionfold Inc. (2008\u20132017).\n\nThe series originated from shorts on Nick's animation showcase, ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', that aired from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a half-hour series on March 30, 2001, due to its popularity. Originally, it ended on November 25, 2006, totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. Production of the series ceased again after Hartman left Nickelodeon in February 2018.<ref name=\"leave1\">{{cite web|last=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-978368492/why-i-left-nickelodeon|via=SoundCloud|date=February 9, 2018|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"leave2\">{{cite web|last1=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4faDISwSVo|website=YouTube|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Premise===\nSet in the fictional town of Dimmsdale, [[California]], ''The Fairly OddParents'' tells the story of a 10-year-old boy named Timmy Turner who is neglected by his parents and tortured by his babysitter, Vicky. One day, he is granted two fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant his every wish to improve his miserable life. However, these wishes usually backfire or cause a series of problems that Timmy must fix. Earlier episodes of the series tend to revolve around Timmy trying to navigate his everyday life at home, at school or elsewhere in town with his best friends, Chester and A.J. or occasionally his parents, while also trying to fix a wish gone awry and ultimately, learning a lesson in the end. Later in the series, Timmy wishes that Cosmo and Wanda would have a baby, whom they named Poof. Much later in the series, Timmy gets a pet fairy dog named Sparky. Even later in the series, Timmy is informed that due to a shortage of available fairies, he must now share Cosmo and Wanda with his neighbor, Chloe Carmichael, who is essentially his polar opposite. Chloe loves sharing, animals, and everything that is ecologically friendly.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Vicky was the main antagonist, but as the series progressed, many more villains were introduced, including: Denzel Crocker, Timmy's mentally-ill teacher who wishes to prove the world that fairies exist; The school bully, Francis; Remy Buxaplenty, a young billionaire child with a fairy godparent who is set on getting rid of Timmy's fairy godparents due to his immense jealousy towards him for having two fairy godparents compared to his one; Dark Laser, a parody of [[Darth Vader]], who wants to destroy Timmy and the Earth; The Pixies, who are known to wield as much power as fairies, but they treat their magical powers like a business. The Pixie's primary goal is to take control of Fairy World and the Earth; The Anti-fairies, who are similar to the actual fairies, but with polar opposite personalities and character traits. Anti-fairies are also known for causing bad luck; and Norm the Genie, who hatches plans to gain freedom from his lamp and get revenge on Timmy.\n\n===Setting===\n''The Fairly OddParents'' is set in the fictional city of Dimmsdale, California. Dimmsdale has a sign on some mountains near the city that is a parody of the [[Hollywood Sign]]. In the episode, \"Vicky Loses Her Icky\", the Mayor of Dimmsdale unveils the \"Welcome to Dimmsdale - Nicest Town on Earth!\" sign. However, at the end of the episode, the President of the United States changes the word \u201cNicest\u201d to \u201cMeanest\u201d. Dimmsdale appears to be average-sized, with a downtown containing large buildings, skyscrapers and a city hall, but also containing uptown areas with suburban residences (including the neighborhood where Timmy, his parents and his friends live) and businesses, such as Timmy's school; a hospital; a jail; a sports complex called, \u201cThe Dimmadome\u201d, which is named after its founder and owner, Doug Dimmadome; a local TV channel and various restaurants and stores, as well as a park in the center of the city. Dimmsdale also appears to have rural farmland located outside of the city. The adults who live in Dimmsdale are notably moronic and often settle situations with things like angry mobs, but they do still manage to form a working and functioning society. In the episode, \"Which Witch is Which?\", it was revealed that Dimmsdale was founded in the 1630s and named after a man called Dale Dimm.\n\nWhen the show needs to, it switches its location to Fairy World, the home of the fairies, which is a floating world located on top of some clouds and colored with an abundance of pink and purple. Fairy World is depicted as a large metropolis with houses, streets, different kinds of buildings and skyscrapers. Most buildings in Fairy World have crowns or stars above their roofs. The fairies have a civilization like that of humans, but with their primary source of power being magic, which also keeps their world afloat. A large rainbow acts as the bridge between Fairy World and the Earth, although the bridge seems to exist only for decoration since fairies teleport via magic to and from Earth. Fairy World is not actually a part of Earth but is depicted as a separate world in outer space located near Earth's orbit that can only be accessed by magic. Among the most notable landmarks in Fairy World is the glowing entrance sign on the other side of the rainbow bridge and the giant wand located in the center of Fairy World that powers the fairies' magic. Jorgen Von Strangle, who acts as the leader of the fairies and Fairy World is an enormous and tough fairy with an [[Austrian accent]], similar to that of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Jorgen personally dislikes Timmy at the beginning of the series but warms up to him over time.\n\nAnother location seen in the show is the city of Chincinatti, the home town of Timmy's favorite comic book superhero, the Crimson Chin. Other locations include the dark and twisted Anti-Fairy World, the dark counterpart of Fairy World where the Anti-fairies reside; the dull and gray metropolis of Pixies Inc., home of the Pixies; and Yugopotamia, another planet where Timmy's alien friend, Mark Chang, lived until the episode \u201cNew Squid in Town!\u201d when Timmy invites Mark to live in the Dimmsdale junkyard in order to escape his evil fianc\u00e9e, Princess Mandie.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Fairly OddParents characters}}\n<!-- http://www.nick.com/shows/fairly-oddparents/characters/timmy-turner.html -->\n* [[Tara Strong]] as [[Timmy Tiberius Turner|Timmy Turner]], [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Poof|Poof]]\n* [[Daran Norris]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Cosmo|Cosmo]]\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Wanda|Wanda]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Vicky|Vicky]]\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Denzel Crocker|Denzel Crocker]]\n* [[Matthew W.

In 1997, [[Fred Seibert]] contacted Hartman about pitching ideas for his ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' series which he was developing for [[Nickelodeon]], Hartman initially declined the offer. Several months later, ''Johnny Bravo'' finished and Hartman decided to create his own series instead of going back to working for other studios.<ref name=\"Nickelodeon podcast\">{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=29oy4OZgMKQ|title=Episode 10: Butch Hartman|date=July 8, 2016|publisher=[[Nickelodeon Animation Podcast]]}}</ref>\n{{Quote box | quote=\"I wanted initially to do a boy version of ''Cinderella''.

Hartman then went back to Seibert at Nickelodeon and successfully pitched it to them for ''Oh Yeah!

On 2000, Nickelodeon ordered seven twenty-three-minute episodes for the series' first season, which premiered on March 30, 2001<ref name=\"107 Facts\"/> in the half-hour before fellow Nicktoon ''[[Invader Zim]]'' made its debut.<ref name=\"fishbowl\">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E7D8133CF936A15750C0A9679C8B63|title=Fishbowl Fairies and an Alien in Exile|first=Kathryn|last=Shattuck|date=March 15, 2001|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the later series, the animation in the original shorts is not as smooth and the designs are notably different (including Timmy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who are only seen from the neck down with their faces hidden in the [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] and appear to be more intelligent than they appeared to be in the proceeding series, yet still easily duped by Vicky's abhorrent actions). Other notable differences include the voices like Timmy Turner, who was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] rather than Tara Strong. Cosmo is significantly more intelligent than he appears to be in the proceeding series while Wanda is shown to be ditzy. Vicky is also much less evil than in the current series; she also calls Timmy by his name as opposed to the more often used \"twerp\".\n\nInitially, Hartman wanted Timmy to wear a blue hat, but he changed it to pink after his blue marker ran out of ink.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzr3A7Sz474|title=Fun Facts About My Shows: The Fairly OddParents, Danny Phantom & TUFF Puppy!|date=September 1, 2015|publisher=Butch Hartman}}</ref> Additionally, Wanda was originally going to have blue hair, but it was also changed to pink so that it wouldn't clash with Timmy's bedroom walls.<ref name=\"107 More Facts\">{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w9G7sCtYqKs|title=107 MORE The Fairly OddParents Facts YOU Should Know!

Twenty Navajo chiefs asked for peace. In 1804 and 1805 the Navajo and Spanish mounted major expeditions against each other's settlements. In May 1805 another peace was established. Similar patterns of peace-making, raiding, and trading among the Navajo, Spanish, Apache, Comanche, and Hopi continued until the arrival of Americans in 1846.<ref name=Correll1976 />\n\n===Territory of New Mexico 1846\u20131863===\n[[File:Manuelito.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chief [[Manuelito]]]]\nThe Navajo encountered the [[United States Army]] in 1846, when General [[Stephen W. Kearny]] invaded Santa Fe with 1,600 men during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, [[Narbona]] and other Navajo negotiated [[Bear Springs Treaty|a treaty of peace]] with Colonel [[Alexander William Doniphan|Alexander Doniphan]] at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of [[Fort Wingate]]). This agreement was not honored by some Navajo, nor by some New Mexicans. The Navajo raided New Mexican livestock, and New Mexicans took women, children, and livestock from the Navajo.<ref>Pages 133 to 140 and 152 to 154, Sides, ''Blood and Thunder''</ref>\n\nIn 1849, the military governor of New Mexico, Colonel [[John M. Washington|John MacRae Washington]]\u2014accompanied by John S. Calhoun, an Indian agent\u2014led a force of 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]]. He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. The United States, on its part, promised \"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper.\"<ref>{{USStat|9|974}}</ref> While en route to this treaty signing, Narbona, a prominent Navajo peace leader, was killed, resulting in hostility between the treaty parties.<ref>[[James H.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo. Other groups continued to come in though 1864.<ref>{{cite book | author=Thompson, Gerald| title=The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863\u20131868 | location=Tucson, Arizona| publisher=The University of Arizona Press | year=1976 | isbn=9780816504954}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all the Navajo came in or were found. Some lived near the San Juan River, some beyond the Hopi villages, and others lived with Apache bands.<ref name=\"Longwalk\"/>\n\n===Long Walk===\n{{main|Long Walk of the Navajo}}\nBeginning in the spring of 1864, the Army forced around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and children to walk over {{convert|300|mi|km}} to [[Fort Sumner]], New Mexico, for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt. Lockett, with the aid of 42 enlisted soldiers, was joined by Lt. Holomon at [[Navajo Springs, Arizona|Navajo Springs]]. Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.\n\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River] with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Lt. Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of [[Henry Chee Dodge]], a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Boarding schools and education===\n{{main|American Indian boarding schools}}\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation.

European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\"/> The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the ''Sil\u00e1o''.{{Clarify|reason=Silao is a Navajo word for Police Officer.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

The museum was founded to preserve the religion and traditions of the Navajo, which Klah was sure would otherwise soon be lost forever.\n\n===Livestock Reduction 1930s\u20131950s===\n{{see also|Navajo Livestock Reduction}}\nThe [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] was imposed upon the Navajo Nation by the federal government starting in the 1933, during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Peter Iverson, ''Dine: A History of the Navajos,'' 2002, University of New Mexico Press, Chapter 5, \"our People Cried\": 1923\u20131941.</ref> Under various forms it continued into the 1950s. Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the [[matrilineal]] and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25443605|title = Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|volume = 38|issue = 4|pages = 437\u2013455|last1 = Weisiger|first1 = Marsha|year = 2007|doi = 10.2307/25443605|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5612987e5b94ff46d5b9ffaaad5f556be04bc308}}</ref>\n\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.<ref name=\"Reduction\" /> They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard White, ch 13: \"The Navajos become Dependent\"|title=The Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change Among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_be-2k1oScC&pg=PA300|year=1988|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=300ff|isbn=0803297246}}</ref> Historian Brian Dippie notes that the [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \"near reign of terror\" on the Navajo reservation.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R. Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II: Toward a New Era in Indian Affairs,'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1999) pp 40, 67, 132, 152</ref>\n\nFour hundred [[Navajo code talkers]] played a famous role during World War II by relaying radio messages using their own language. The Japanese were unable to understand or decode it.<ref>Bernstein, ''American Indians and World War II'' pp 46\u201349</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s, large quantities of uranium were discovered in Navajo land. From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their tact. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.\n\nThere is a system of [[clans]] which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques.

The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or T\u00e1shch\u00f3zhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World.

The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.

He signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders: Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. The United States, on its part, promised \"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper.\"<ref>{{USStat|9|974}}</ref> While en route to this treaty signing, Narbona, a prominent Navajo peace leader, was killed, resulting in hostility between the treaty parties.<ref>[[James H.

Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajo from each other. However, the Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860\u201361. They killed Navajo warriors, captured women and children for slaves, and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period ''Naahondzood'', \"the fearing time.\"\n\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General [[James Henry Carleton|James H. Carleton]], Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajo and Apache. Colonel [[Kit Carson]]  was at the new [[Fort Wingate]] with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia.  Carleton ordered Carson to kill [[Mescalero]] Apache men and destroy any Mescalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control. The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called [[Bosque Redondo]].\n\nIn the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajo and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came in to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] for relief. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups departed to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo. Other groups continued to come in though 1864.<ref>{{cite book | author=Thompson, Gerald| title=The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863\u20131868 | location=Tucson, Arizona| publisher=The University of Arizona Press | year=1976 | isbn=9780816504954}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all the Navajo came in or were found. Some lived near the San Juan River, some beyond the Hopi villages, and others lived with Apache bands.<ref name=\"Longwalk\"/>\n\n===Long Walk===\n{{main|Long Walk of the Navajo}}\nBeginning in the spring of 1864, the Army forced around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and children to walk over {{convert|300|mi|km}} to [[Fort Sumner]], New Mexico, for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo, as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for the 4,000\u20135,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as were raids by other tribes and civilians. Some Navajo froze during the winter because they could make only poor shelters from the few materials and resources they were given. This period is known among the Navajo as \"The Fearing Time\".<ref>George Bornstein, \"The Fearing Time: Telling the tales of Indian slavery in American history\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 20 October 2017 p. 29 (review of Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez, ''The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, {{ISBN|9780547640983}}).</ref> In addition, a small group of [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]], longtime enemies of the Navajos had been relocated to the area. Conflicts resulted.\n\nIn 1868, the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]] was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajo to return to a [[Native American reservation|reservation]] on a portion of their former homeland.\n\n===Reservation era===\n\n[[File:Navajo woman & child.jpg|thumb|200px|Navajo woman and child, ''circa'' 1880\u20131910]]\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajo as [[Navajo Scouts|\"Indian Scouts\"]] at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.<ref>Marei Bouknight and others, ''Guide to Records in the Military Archives Division Pertaining to Indian-White Relations,'' GSA National Archives, 1972</ref> During this period, Chief [[Manuelito]] founded the [[Navajo Tribal Police]]. It operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\n\nBy treaty, the Navajo were allowed to leave the reservation for trade, with permission from the military or local [[Indian agent]]. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids, as the tribe was able to increase the size of their livestock herds and cultivated crops. In addition, the tribe gained an increase in the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres ({{convert|14,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) to the 16 million acres ({{convert|65,000|km\u00b2|mi2|abbr=on}}) as it stands today. But economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajo. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\n\nIn 1883, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate the Navajo and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.<ref>Ford, \"September 30, 1887 Letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref> In the same year, Lt. Lockett, with the aid of 42 enlisted soldiers, was joined by Lt. Holomon at [[Navajo Springs, Arizona|Navajo Springs]]. Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajo warriors were looking for them.\n\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a dwelling on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died as a result, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajo at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, told Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.<ref>Kerr, \"February 18, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona.</ref> In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River] with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Lt. Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajo. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.<ref>Scott,\" June 22, 1887 letter to Acting Assistant General,\" District of New Mexico, National Archive Materials, Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock, Arizona</ref>\n\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajo a fine of livestock. The Navajo tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajo were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajo used force to free the women and retreated to [[Beautiful Mountain]] with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of [[Henry Chee Dodge]], a leader among the Navajo, defused the situation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Boarding schools and education===\n{{main|American Indian boarding schools}}\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to assimilate to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation. The first [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) school opened at [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] in 1870<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftdefiance.navajochapters.org/|website=FORT DEFIANCE CHAPTER|accessdate=31 May 2017|title=Fort Defiance Chapter}}</ref> and led the way for eight others to be established.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\">{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=42}}</ref> Many older Navajo were against this education and would hide their children to keep them from being taken.\n\nOnce the children arrived at the boarding school, their lives changed dramatically. European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.<ref name=\"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\"/> The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the ''Sil\u00e1o''.{{Clarify|reason=Silao is a Navajo word for Police Officer.

This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|page=48}}</ref>\n\nThis report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. But Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as having a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial for the Navajo children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=T.L.|last2=Bia|first2=Fred|title=A Place to be Navajo: Rough Rock and the Struggle for Self-Determination in Indigenous Schooling|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-3760-4|pages=50\u20131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Navajo Woman and Infant, Canyon de Chelle, Arizona.\" (Canyon de Chelly National Monument), 1933 - 1942 - NARA - 519947.jpg|thumb|left|''Untitled''.

It is a repository for sound recordings, manuscripts, paintings, and sandpainting tapestries of the Navajos. It also featured exhibits to express the beauty, dignity, and logic of Navajo religion. When Klah met Cabot in 1921, he had witnessed decades of efforts by the US government and  missionaries to assimilate the Navajos into mainstream society. The museum was founded to preserve the religion and traditions of the Navajo, which Klah was sure would otherwise soon be lost forever.\n\n===Livestock Reduction 1930s\u20131950s===\n{{see also|Navajo Livestock Reduction}}\nThe [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] was imposed upon the Navajo Nation by the federal government starting in the 1933, during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Peter Iverson, ''Dine: A History of the Navajos,'' 2002, University of New Mexico Press, Chapter 5, \"our People Cried\": 1923\u20131941.</ref> Under various forms it continued into the 1950s. Worried about large herds in the arid climate, at a time when the Dust Bowl was endangering the Great Plains, the government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could support only a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed that land erosion was worsening in the area and the only solution was to reduce the number of livestock.\n\nIn 1933, [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was appointed commissioner of the BIA. In many ways, he worked to reform government relations with the Native American tribes, but the reduction program was devastating for the Navajo, for whom their livestock was so important. The government set land capacity in terms of \"sheep units\".  In 1930 the Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units.<ref name=\"Reduction\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth |title=Navajo Livestock Reduction: A National Disgrace | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-912586-18-4}}</ref> These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Iverson|title=\"For Our Navajo People\": Din\u00e9 Letters, Speeches & Petitions, 1900-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dU2_8WAkD4EC&pg=PA250|year=2002|publisher=U of New Mexico Press|page=250|isbn=9780826327185}}</ref>\n\nCollier's solution was to first launch a voluntary reduction program, which was made mandatory two years later in 1935. The government paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to compensate for the loss of future yearly income for so many Navajo. In the [[matrilineal]] and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income with the reduction of livestock herds.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25443605|title = Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|volume = 38|issue = 4|pages = 437\u2013455|last1 = Weisiger|first1 = Marsha|year = 2007|doi = 10.2307/25443605|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5612987e5b94ff46d5b9ffaaad5f556be04bc308}}</ref>\n\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.<ref name=\"Reduction\" /> They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard White, ch 13: \"The Navajos become Dependent\"|title=The Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change Among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_be-2k1oScC&pg=PA300|year=1988|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=300ff|isbn=0803297246}}</ref> Historian Brian Dippie notes that the [[Indian Rights Association]] denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \"near reign of terror\" on the Navajo reservation.

Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, and they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. The Navajo gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world, and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation, which had few jobs.<ref>Alison R.

From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajo have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.<ref>Judy Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt- An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed,'' Free Press, New York, 2010.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps Involvement===\nThe Navajo Code Talkers played a significant role in the history of [[USMC]] history. Using their own language they utilized a military code; for example, the Navajo word \"turtle\" represented a tank. In 1942, Marine staff officers composed several combat simulations and the Navajo translated it and transmitted in their dialect to another Navajo on the other line. This Navajo then translated it back in english faster than any other cryptographic facilities, which demonstrated their tact. As a result, General Vogel recommended their recruitment into the USMC code talker program. \n\nEach Navajo went through basic bootcamp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot]], San Diego before being assigned to Field Signal Battalion training at [[Camp Pendleton]]. Once the code talkers completed training in the States, they were sent to the Pacific for assignment to the Marine combat divisions. With that said, there was never a crack in the Navajo language, it was never deciphered. It is known that many more Navajos volunteered to become code talkers than could be accepted; however, an undetermined number of other Navajos served as Marines in the war, but not as code talkers. \n\nThese achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers have resulted in an honorable chapter in USMC history. Their patriotism and honor inevitably earned them the respect of all Americans.<ref> Marine Corps.

Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.\n\nThere is a system of [[clans]] which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is [[exogamy|exogamous]]: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. Some Navajo favor their\nchildren to marry into their father\u2019s clan. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.<ref name=\"Longwalk\">{{cite book | author=Compiled | editor=Roessel, Ruth | title=Navajo Stories of the Long Walk Period | location=Tsaile, Arizona | publisher=Navajo Community College Press | year=1973 | isbn=0-912586-16-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/navajostoriesofl0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|xix-xxi}}\n\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a [[matrilineal]] system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would follow a [[matrilocal]] residence and live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. In cases of marital separation, women would maintain the property and children.  Children are \"born to\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \"born for\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.<ref name=\"TheNavajo\" /> <!--Note: matrilocal is not the equivalent as matriarchal-->\n\nNeither sex can live without the other in the Navajo culture. Men and women are seen as contemporary equals as both a male and female are needed to reproduce. Although women may carry a bigger burden, fertility is so highly valued that males are expected to provide economic resources (known as [[bride wealth]]). Corn is a symbol of fertility in Navajo culture as they eat white corn in the wedding ceremonies. It is considered to be immoral and/or stealing if one does not provide for the other in that premarital or marital relationship. <ref> Lauren Del Carlo, ''Between the Sacred Mountains: A Cultural History of the Dineh,'' Essai, Volume 5: Article 15, 2007.</ref>\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Navajo ethnobotany]].\n\n===Traditional dwellings===\n[[File:Navajo hogan.jpg|thumb|left|A Navajo hogan (with a woodshed)]]\nA [[hogan]], the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan is an eight-sided house.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both are made of logs and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the [[Blessing Way|''kinaald\u00e1'']], take place inside a hogan.<ref>Iverson, Nez, and Deer, 23</ref> According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.<ref name=k>Kehoe, 133</ref>\n\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \"[[The Blessingway]]\" (''{{spell-nv|h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301j\u00ed}}'') describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques.

The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World.

The Blessing Way ceremonies are based on establishing \"peace, harmony, and good things exclusively\" within the Dine. The Enemy Way, or Evil Way ceremonies are concerned with counteracting influences that come from outside the Dine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Spiritual healing ceremonies are rooted in Navajo traditional stories. One of them, the Night Chant ceremony, is conducted over several days and involves up to 24 dancers. The ceremony requires  the dancers to wear buckskin masks, as do many of the other Navajo ceremonies, and they all represent specific gods.<ref name=\":2\" /> The purpose of the Night Chant is to purify the patients and heal them through prayers to the spirit-beings. Each day of the ceremony entails the performance of certain rites and the creation of detailed sand paintings. One of the songs describes the home of the thunderbirds:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nIn Tsegihi [White House],\nIn the house made of the dawn,\nIn the house made of the evening light<ref>Sandner, 88</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nThe ceremonial leader proceeds by asking the Holy People to be present in the beginning of the ceremony, then identifying the patient with the power of the spirit-being, and describing the patient's transformation to renewed health with lines such as, \"Happily I recover.\"<ref>Sandner, 90</ref>\n\nCeremonies are used to correct curses that cause some illnesses or misfortunes.

[[Atsidi Sani]] (c. 1830\u2013c. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called ''Nakai Tsosi'' (\"Thin Mexican\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.<ref>Adair 4</ref> By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating [[handmade jewelry]] including bracelets, tobacco flasks, [[necklace]]s and [[bracer]]s. Later, they added silver [[earrings]], [[buckles]], [[Bolo tie|bolos]], hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.<ref>Adair 135</ref>\n\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \"squash blossom\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \"squash blossom\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican [[pomegranate]] designs.<ref>Adair 44</ref> The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \"naja\" (''najahe'' in Navajo)<ref>Adair, 9</ref> symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \"squash blossom\" necklace.\n\n[[Turquoise]] has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\n\n===Weaving===\n{{Main|Navajo weaving}}\n[[File:Navajo sheep & weaver.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Navajo weaver with sheep]]\n[[File:Navajo Germantown Rug 2008.008.001.jpg|180px|thumb|Navajo Germantown Eye Dazzler Rug, [[Science History Institute]] ]]\n[[File:Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design, 1870-1880, 50.67.54.jpg|thumbnail|''Probably Bayeta-style Blanket with Terrace and Stepped Design'', 1870\u20131880, 50.67.54, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by [[Ute tribe|Ute]] and [[Plains Indians]]. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\n\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from [[Philadelphia]], commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\n\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying [[Navajo rug]]s by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and [[Navajo Rug|rugs]] into distinct styles. These included \"Two Gray Hills\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); ''Teec Nos Pos'' (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \"Ganado\" (founded by [[Don Lorenzo Hubbell]]<ref>[http://www.wmonline.com/attract/pforest/hubbell.htm \"Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\"] ''White Mountains Online.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref>), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \"Crystal\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and [[Persian rug|Persian]] styles (almost always with [[natural dye]]s); \"Wide Ruins\", \"Chinlee\", banded geometric patterns; \"Klagetoh\", diamond-type patterns; \"Red Mesa\" and bold diamond patterns.<ref>Denver Art Museum. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa75.htm \"Blanket Statements\"], ''Traditional Fine Arts Organization.'' (retrieved 28 Nov 2010)</ref> Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or ''[[h\u00f3zh\u01eb\u0301]]''.\n\n==In the media==\nIn 2000 the documentary ''[[The Return of Navajo Boy]]'' was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was written in response to an earlier film, ''[[The Navajo Boy]]'' which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. ''The Return of Navajo Boy'' allowed the Navajos to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.<ref name=navajoboy.com>{{cite web|title=Synopsis |work=navajoboy.com |url=http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |accessdate=2009-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208005920/http://www.navajoboy.com/press.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show ''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]'', the show's producer [[Morgan Spurlock]] spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico.

He was subsequently a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from 1897 until 1910.  He was the brother of [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]], one of the candidates in the contested [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1872|1872 election]] for governor.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Mrs Samuel D. McEnery.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Samuel D. McEnery]]\n\nMcEnery was born in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] in [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]] in [[North Louisiana]].  He attended [[Spring Hill College]] in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], and the [[University of Virginia]] at [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].  In 1859, McEnery graduated from the [[State and National Law School]] in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  McEnery served as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1866, McEnery began practicing law in Monroe.  He became active in the Democratic Party, and served as its chairman in [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]]. He was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|lieutenant governor]] in 1879, and became [[Governor]] of Louisiana in 1881 after the death of [[Louis A. Wiltz]]. McEnery was elected to a full term as governor in 1884, but failed to be re-elected in 1888.  McEnery's administration was weak because of the power wielded by the State Treasurer [[Edward A. Burke]] and the [[Public corruption|corrupt]] [[Louisiana State Lottery Company]]. Despite Louisiana's [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] (and majority in [[Acadiana]] and many of the southern parishes of the state), McEnery was the last Catholic to be elected governor prior to [[Edwin Edwards]] in 1972.<ref>After Edwin Edwards, Catholics [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]], [[Bobby Jindal]], and [[John Bel Edwards]] were elected governors.</ref>\n\nAfter losing the 1888 election, McEnery was appointed to serve as an associate justice in the Louisiana Supreme Court.  He was elected to serve in the [[United States Senate]] in 1896, serving there until his death in 1910.

{"title_page": "Irreducible component", "text_new": "{{short description|Subset (often algebraic set) that is not the union of subsets of the same nature}}\nIn [[mathematics]], specifically in [[algebraic geometry]], the concept of an '''irreducible component''' is used to formalize the idea that an [[Algebraic variety|algebraic set]] such as the one defined by the equation ''XY'' = 0 is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the two lines ''X'' = 0 and ''Y'' = 0. Thus an algebraic set is '''irreducible''' if it is not the union of two [[Subset#Definitions|proper]] algebraic subsets. It is a fundamental theorem of classical algebraic geometry that every algebraic set is the union of a finite number of irreducible algebraic subsets (varieties), and that, if one removes those subsets contained in another one, this decomposition is unique. The elements of this unique decomposition are called '''irreducible components'''.\n\nThis notion may be reformulated in [[topology|topological]] terms, using the [[Zariski topology]], for which the [[closed set|closed sets]] are the subvarieties: an algebraic set is irreducible if it is not the union of two proper subsets that are closed in the Zariski topology. This allows a generalization in topology and, through it, to general [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] for which the above property of finite decomposition is not necessarily true.\n\n== In topology ==\nA [[Topological spaces|topological space]] ''X'' is '''reducible''' if it can be written as a union <math>X = X_1 \\cup X_2</math> of two non-empty [[Closed set|closed]] proper subsets <math>X_1</math>, <math>X_2</math> of <math>X</math>. A topological space is '''irreducible''' (or '''[[hyperconnected space|hyperconnected]]''') if it is not reducible. Equivalently, a topological space is irreducible if every nonempty [[open set|open]] subsets of ''X'' is [[dense set|dense]] or if any two nonempty open sets have nonempty [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]].\n\nA subset ''F'' of a topological space ''X'' is called irreducible or reducible if ''F'' considered as a topological space via the [[subspace topology]] has the corresponding property in the above sense. That is, <math>F</math> is reducible if it can be written as a union <math>F = (G_1\\cap F)\\cup(G_2\\cap F)</math> where <math>G_1,G_2</math> are closed subsets of <math>X</math>, neither of which contains <math>F</math>.\n\nAn '''irreducible component''' of a [[topological space]] is a [[maximal element|maximal]] irreducible subset. If a subset is irreducible, its [[closure (topology)|closure]] is, so irreducible components are always closed.\n\n== In algebraic geometry ==\n\nEvery [[affine variety|affine]] or [[projective variety|projective algebraic set]] is defined as the set of the zeros of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a [[polynomial ring]]. In this case, the irreducible components are the varieties associated to the minimal primes over the ideal. This is the identification that allows to prove the uniqueness and the finiteness of the decomposition. This decomposition is strongly related with the [[primary decomposition]] of the ideal.\n\nIn general [[scheme theory]], every scheme is the union of its irreducible components, but the number of components is not necessarily finite. However, in most cases occurring in \"practice\", namely for all [[noetherian scheme|noetherian schemes]], there are finitely many irreducible components.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe irreducibility depends much on actual topology on some set. For example, possibly contradicting the intuition, the real numbers are reducible for their usual topology: they are the union of the two closed intervals (-\u221e,0] and [0,+\u221e).\n\nThe notion of irreducible component is fundamental in algebraic geometry and rarely considered outside this area of mathematics: consider the algebraic set\n\n:''X'' := {(''x'', ''y'') | ''xy'' = 0}.\n\nIt is subset of the plane. For the [[Zariski topology]], its closed subsets are itself, the empty set, the [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] and the two lines defined by ''x'' = 0 and ''y'' = 0. It is thus reducible with these two lines as irreducible components.\n\nThis can also be read off the coordinate ring ''k''[''x'',&nbsp;''y'']/(''xy'') (if the variety is defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''), whose minimal [[prime ideal]]s are (''x'') and (''y''). \n \n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=1109|title=irreducible}}\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=3107|title=Irreducible component}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Irreducible Component}}\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:General topology]]\n[[Category:Algebraic varieties]]\n\n[[fr:Dimension_de_Krull#Composantes_irr.C3.A9ductibles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Subset (often algebraic set) that is not the union of subsets of the same nature}}\nIn [[mathematics]], specifically in [[algebraic geometry]], the concept of an '''irreducible component''' is used to formalize the idea that an [[Algebraic variety|algebraic set]] such as the one defined by the equation ''XY'' = 0 is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the two lines ''X'' = 0 and ''Y'' = 0.

If a subset is irreducible, its [[closure (topology)|closure]] is, so irreducible components are always closed.\n\n== In algebraic geometry ==\n\nEvery [[affine variety|affine]] or [[projective variety|projective algebraic set]] is defined as the set of the zeros of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a [[polynomial ring]]. In this case, the irreducible components are the varieties associated to the minimal primes over the ideal. This is the identification that allows to prove the uniqueness and the finiteness of the decomposition. This decomposition is strongly related with the [[primary decomposition]] of the ideal.\n\nIn general [[scheme theory]], every scheme is the union of its irreducible components, but the number of components is not necessarily finite. However, in most cases occurring in \"practice\", namely for all [[noetherian scheme|noetherian schemes]], there are finitely many irreducible components.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe irreducibility depends much on actual topology on some set. For example, possibly contradicting the intuition, the real numbers are reducible for their usual topology: they are the union of the two closed intervals ]-\u221e,0] and [0,+\u221e[.\n\nThe notion of irreducible component is fundamental in algebraic geometry and rarely considered outside this area of mathematics: consider the algebraic set\n\n:''X'' := {(''x'', ''y'') | ''xy'' = 0}.\n\nIt is subset of the plane. For the [[Zariski topology]], its closed subsets are itself, the empty set, the [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] and the two lines defined by ''x'' = 0 and ''y'' = 0. It is thus reducible with these two lines as irreducible components.\n\nThis can also be read off the coordinate ring ''k''[''x'',&nbsp;''y'']/(''xy'') (if the variety is defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''), whose minimal [[prime ideal]]s are (''x'') and (''y''). \n \n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=1109|title=irreducible}}\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=3107|title=Irreducible component}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Irreducible Component}}\n[[Category:Algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:General topology]]\n[[Category:Algebraic varieties]]\n\n[[fr:Dimension_de_Krull#Composantes_irr.C3.A9ductibles]]\n", "name_user": "Hiabc", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExamples:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_component"}
