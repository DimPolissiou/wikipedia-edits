The lumberyard shut down in 2009.]]\n\nCotter & Company was established in 1948 by John Cotter with 12 original member stores. The cooperative grew in membership and in 1962 Cotter & Company purchased the assets of Hibbard Spencer Bartlett & Company for $2.5 million, acquiring the True Value trademark for $2500 as part of the acquisition.<ref name=\"rfb\" /> ServiStar Hardware (formerly American Hardware Supply) had previously purchased Coast to Coast Hardware<ref name=\"rfb\" /> and had renamed itself to Servistar & Coast to Coast Hardware.

In 1997 they merged with Cotter & Company to form TruServ Corporation.\n\nDuring a 1999 audit, accounting irregularities of about $100 million were discovered originating from pre-merger Cotter & Company, leading to a $131 million loss that year causing the value of TruServ stock to plummet.<ref name=\"rfb\" /> During this tumultuous period (1999\u20132001), a number of hardware stores chose to leave TruServ to join competing hardware cooperatives ([[Ace Hardware]], [[Do It Best]]). TruServ Corporation brought in new management, eliminated the ServiStar and Coast to Coast brand names, and streamlined operations by closing many of the regional distribution centers.  In 2006 TruServ Corporation was renamed True Value Company.\n\nIn 2018 an international private equity investment firm, ACON, purchased True Value.''<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.truevaluecompany.com/Newsroom/News-and-Updates/Press-Releases/ID/52/True-Value-Company-and-Acon-Investments-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-To-Accelerate-Transformation-of-True-Value-Business|title=True Value Company and Acon Investments Announce Strategic Partnership To Accelerate Transformation of True Value Business > True Value Company|website=Truevaluecompany.com|accessdate=11 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 True Value announced the opening of its first all new custom designed distribution center in over 30 years.

This update comes as True Value has grown and expanded the number of businesses it serves after the majority of the company was purchased by ACON in 2018. Along with the new distribution center True Value has also adopted the \"hub-and-spoke\" model along with new software that will allow all warehouses to operate extremely efficiently through forecasted inventory models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/true-value-retools-hardware-supply-chain-11563300888|title=True Value Retools Hardware Supply Chain|first=Jennifer|last=Smith|website=Wsj.com|accessdate=11 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== General Paint & Manufacturing ==\nTrue Value owns its paint manufacturing plant known as General Paint & Manufacturing (GPM) and also manufactures paint for a variety of other companies.

It was started by ServiStar to help build their lawn and garden sales.  Today there are over 260 Home & Garden Showplace stores across the United States.

Grand Rental Station, Taylor Rental, and Party Central are all standalone, independently owned franchises. Today there are over 400 of these stores across the United States.  These stores purchase merchandise both through the True Value distribution centers and directly from certain manufacturers.  ''True Value Rental'' is the in-store rental program found in many True Value Hardware stores across the country.\n\n== Induserve Supply == \nInduserve Supply is the [[Maintenance, repair and operations|MRO]] store identity of the True Value Company.

They are manufactured to company specifications and are sold exclusively by True Value member stores, including True Value, Home & Garden Showplace, and other affiliates.\n\n==TruServ Canada==\nThe roots of the Canadian affiliate ''TruServ Canada'' go back to the Stedman's chain founded in 1907 in Ontario, and the Macleod's chain of Western Canada founded in 1917.  Together they became Macleod-Stedman Inc. in 1964. In 1992 Macleod-Stedman became Cotter Canada.  When Cotter in the US changed its name to TrueServ 1997, so did the Canadian affiliate.

ABC wanted to split the network and show the NHL in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[NASCAR on ESPN|NASCAR]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] on Sunday afternoons.\n\n====ABC's coverage of the Winter Olympics====\nIt should be noted that even though ABC didn't yet televise National Hockey League games, they were the [[ABC Olympic broadcasts|American network broadcast home]] of the [[Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic]] games beginning in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and continuing through the [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Games]] from [[Calgary]]. For the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey events]], employed [[Curt Gowdy]] for play-by-play [[Olympics on ABC commentators|duties]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968]] and [[Ice hockey at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976]] ([[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBC]] had the broadcasting rights for the [[1972 Winter Olympics|1972 Games]] in the interim) Games. Gowdy worked with [[Brian Conacher]] for the 1976 ice hockey events.\n\nFor years [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|later]] at [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], ABC was on hand for a medal-round men's [[ice hockey]] game that would soon become known the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\". On February 22, 1980, the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]] team, made up of [[amateur]] and [[college sports|collegiate]] players and led by coach [[Herb Brooks]], defeated the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet team]], which consisted of veteran professional players with significant experience in international play. The rest of the United States (except those who watched the game live on Canadian television) had to wait to see the game, as ABC decided to broadcast the late-afternoon game on tape delay in prime time.<ref name=espn>[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html \"College kids perform Olympic miracle\"], ESPN.com</ref> Sportscaster [[Al Michaels]], who was calling the game on ABC along with former [[Montreal Canadiens]] goalie [[Ken Dryden]], picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call:<ref name=youtube2>{{YouTube|id=QTev5pSuYLk|title=1980 Miracle On Ice}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Eleven seconds, you've got ten seconds, the countdown going on right now! [[Ken Morrow|Morrow]], up to [[Dave Silk|Silk]]. Five seconds left in the game. Do you believe in miracles? YES!}}\n\nAl Michaels would continue serving as ABC's top play-by-play announcer for their ice hockey coverage for their next two Winter Olympics. In [[Ice hockey at the 1984 Winter Olympics|1984]] from [[Sarajevo]], Michaels again worked alongside Ken Dryden while [[Mike Eruzione]], who was the [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] of the gold medal winning United States ice hockey team from 1980, primarily worked with [[Don Chevrier]]. For ABC's final Winter Olympics [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|four years later]], Michaels was once again, working with Dryden while Eruzione was this time, paired with [[Jiggs McDonald]].\n\n====ABC Radio coverage (1989\u20131991)====\nIn 1989,<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC RADIO GETS STANLEY CUP|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=September 12, 1989}}</ref> the NHL signed a two-year contract (lasting through the {{NHL Year|1990}} season) with [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] for the broadcast rights to the All-Star Game and Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite news|title=NOTEBOOK; Regular Season Honors to Bruins; Liut Top Goalie|author=Robert Fachet|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=B08|date=April 3, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV deal offers another chance but CFL needs a career year|author=Rob Grant|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|page=C.8|date=May 17, 1991}}</ref> ABC Radio named [[Don Chevrier]] and [[Phil Esposito]] as their main commentating crew.<ref>{{cite news|title=Relief role McGwire's dream|author=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=Toronto Star|page=G1|date=July 16, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Munchies List is Some Food for Thought|newspaper=[[Worcester Telegram & Gazette]]|page=B8|date=May 19, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cool Goodyear feels the heat of Indy-scribable media hype|author=Rob Grant|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=May 19, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Palmer heads the short list as replacement for Kubek|author=Ken McKee|newspaper=Toronto Star|page=B7|date=December 22, 1989}}</ref>\n\n===Time-buy deal with ESPN (1992\u20131994)===\nIn the {{NHL Year|1992}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Network Lineup|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138127/index.htm|author=Steve Wulf|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=December 27, 1993}}</ref> and {{NHL Year|1993}} seasons, ABC televised six<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|date=September 2, 1992|title=NHL strikes TV deal with ESPN|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/09/02/NHL-strikes-TV-deal-with-ESPN/2438715406400/|work=UPI|location= |access-date= }}</ref> weekly regional telecasts<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL governors \"ecstatic' over reported TV package|newspaper=[[Kitchener-Waterloo Record]]|page=E2|date=August 27, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Hot Not|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=While+the+NBA%27s+image+has+cooled%2C+the+NHL+has+ignited+-+06.20.94+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=421025542&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1005307%2F4%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|author=E.M.

In the league's previous broadcast television deal with Fox, the network split coverage of the [[List of Stanley Cup Finals broadcasters|Stanley Cup Finals]] with [[ESPN National Hockey Night|ESPN]]. Games 1, 5 and 7 were usually scheduled to be televised by Fox; Games 2, 3, 4 and 6 by ESPN. However, from [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]] to [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]], the Finals were all four-game sweeps; [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]] ended in six games. The consequence was that \u2013 except for 1995, when Fox did televise Game 4 \u2013 the decisive game was never on network television.\n\n2003 was the only year that ABC broadcast both the [[2003 NBA Finals|NBA]] and the [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] that involved teams from one city in the same year, as both the [[2002\u201303 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]] and the [[2002\u201303 New Jersey Devils season|New Jersey Devils]] were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of Game 3 between the [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] and the Nets in [[New Jersey]] on June 8, [[Brad Nessler]], [[Tom Tolbert]] and [[Bill Walton]] said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and Game 7 of the [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] between the Devils and the [[2002\u201303 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim season|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] the following night, also at [[Continental Airlines Arena]]. [[Gary Thorne]], [[Bill Clement]] and [[John Davidson (ice hockey)|John Davidson]] mentioned this the following night, and thanked Nessler, Tolbert and Walton for promoting ABC's broadcast of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite video|title=NHL on ABC: Game 7 of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals|medium=television|publisher=ABC Sports|date=June 9, 2003}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 2003\u201304 season, ESPN was only willing to renew its contract for two additional years at $60 million per year.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL announces TV deal with NBC|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2004-05-19-martzke-nbc_x.htm|author=Rudy Martzke|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 19, 2004|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> ABC refused to televise the Stanley Cup Finals in prime time, suggesting that the Finals games it would telecast be played on weekend afternoons (including a potential Game 7).

For the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|ice hockey events]], employed [[Curt Gowdy]] for play-by-play [[Olympics on ABC commentators|duties]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1968 Winter Olympics|1968]] and [[Ice hockey at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976]] ([[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBC]] had the broadcasting rights for the [[1972 Winter Olympics|1972 Games]] in the interim) Games. Gowdy worked with [[Brian Conacher]] for the 1976 ice hockey events.\n\nFor years [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|later]] at [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], ABC was on hand for a medal-round men's [[ice hockey]] game that would soon become known the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\". On February 22, 1980, the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]] team, made up of [[amateur]] and [[college sports|collegiate]] players and led by coach [[Herb Brooks]], defeated the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet team]], which consisted of veteran professional players with significant experience in international play. The rest of the United States (except those who watched the game live on Canadian television) had to wait to see the game, as ABC decided to broadcast the late-afternoon game on tape delay in prime time.<ref name=espn>[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html \"College kids perform Olympic miracle\"], ESPN.com</ref> Sportscaster [[Al Michaels]], who was calling the game on ABC along with former [[Montreal Canadiens]] goalie [[Ken Dryden]], picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call:<ref name=youtube2>{{YouTube|id=QTev5pSuYLk|title=1980 Miracle On Ice}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Eleven seconds, you've got ten seconds, the countdown going on right now! [[Ken Morrow|Morrow]], up to [[Dave Silk|Silk]]. Five seconds left in the game. Do you believe in miracles?

In [[Ice hockey at the 1984 Winter Olympics|1984]] from [[Sarajevo]], Michaels again worked alongside Ken Dryden while [[Mike Eruzione]], who was the [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]], of the gold medal winning United States ice hockey team from 1980, primarily worked with [[Don Chevrier]]. For ABC's final Winter Olympics [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|four years later]], Michaels was once again, working with Dryden while Eruzione was this time, paired with [[Jiggs McDonald]].\n\n====ABC Radio coverage (1989\u20131991)====\nIn 1989,<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC RADIO GETS STANLEY CUP|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=September 12, 1989}}</ref> the NHL signed a two-year contract (lasting through the {{NHL Year|1990}} season) with [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] for the broadcast rights to the All-Star Game and Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite news|title=NOTEBOOK; Regular Season Honors to Bruins; Liut Top Goalie|author=Robert Fachet|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=B08|date=April 3, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TV deal offers another chance but CFL needs a career year|author=Rob Grant|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|page=C.8|date=May 17, 1991}}</ref> ABC Radio named [[Don Chevrier]] and [[Phil Esposito]] as their main commentating crew.<ref>{{cite news|title=Relief role McGwire's dream|author=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=Toronto Star|page=G1|date=July 16, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Munchies List is Some Food for Thought|newspaper=[[Worcester Telegram & Gazette]]|page=B8|date=May 19, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cool Goodyear feels the heat of Indy-scribable media hype|author=Rob Grant|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=May 19, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Palmer heads the short list as replacement for Kubek|author=Ken McKee|newspaper=Toronto Star|page=B7|date=December 22, 1989}}</ref>\n\n===Time-buy deal with ESPN (1992\u20131994)===\nIn the {{NHL Year|1992}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Network Lineup|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138127/index.htm|author=Steve Wulf|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=December 27, 1993}}</ref> and {{NHL Year|1993}} seasons, ABC televised six<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|date=September 2, 1992|title=NHL strikes TV deal with ESPN|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/09/02/NHL-strikes-TV-deal-with-ESPN/2438715406400/|work=UPI|location= |access-date= }}</ref> weekly regional telecasts<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL governors \"ecstatic' over reported TV package|newspaper=[[Kitchener-Waterloo Record]]|page=E2|date=August 27, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Hot Not|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=While+the+NBA%27s+image+has+cooled%2C+the+NHL+has+ignited+-+06.20.94+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=421025542&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1005307%2F4%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|author=E.M.

In the league's previous broadcast television deal with Fox, the network split coverage of the [[List of Stanley Cup Finals broadcasters|Stanley Cup Finals]] with [[ESPN National Hockey Night|ESPN]]. Games 1, 5 and 7 were usually scheduled to be televised by Fox; Games 2, 3, 4 and 6 by ESPN. However, from [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]] to [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]], the Finals were all four-game sweeps; [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]] ended in six games. The consequence was that \u2013 except for 1995, when Fox did televise Game 4 \u2013 the decisive game was never on network television.\n\n2003 was the only year that ABC broadcast both the [[2003 NBA Finals|NBA]] and the [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] that involved teams from one city in the same year, as both the [[2002\u201303 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]] and the [[2002\u201303 New Jersey Devils season|New Jersey Devils]] were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of Game 3 between the [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] and the Nets in [[New Jersey]] on June 8, [[Brad Nessler]], [[Tom Tolbert]] and [[Bill Walton]] said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and Game 7 of the [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] between the Devils and the [[2002\u201303 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim season|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] the following night, also at [[Continental Airlines Arena]]. [[Gary Thorne]], [[Bill Clement]] and [[John Davidson (ice hockey)|John Davidson]] mentioned this the following night, and thanked Nessler, Tolbert and Walton for promoting ABC's broadcast of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite video|title=NHL on ABC: Game 7 of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals|medium=television|publisher=ABC Sports|date=June 9, 2003}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 2003\u201304 season, ESPN was only willing to renew its contract for two additional years at $60 million per year.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL announces TV deal with NBC|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2004-05-19-martzke-nbc_x.htm|author=Rudy Martzke|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 19, 2004|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> ABC refused to televise the Stanley Cup Finals in prime time, suggesting that the Finals games it would telecast be played on weekend afternoons (including a potential Game 7).

The council was first led by his uncle [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1547\u20131549), and then by [[John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick]] (1550\u20131553), who from 1551 was [[Duke of Northumberland]].\n\nEdward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in exchange for peace. The transformation of the [[Church of England]] into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, Henry{{nbsp}}VIII, had severed the link between the Church and [[Catholic Church|Rome]], Henry{{nbsp}}VIII had never permitted the renunciation of [[Catholic doctrine]] or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was [[established church|established]] for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the imposition of compulsory services in English.\n\nIn February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a \"Devise for the Succession\", to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his [[Cousin#Relationship charts|first cousin once removed]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. This decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary nine days after becoming queen. During her reign, Mary reversed Edward's Protestant reforms, which nonetheless became the basis of the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] of 1559.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Edward VI as a Child - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Prince Edward as a baby, depicted with regal splendour and a kingly gesture.

In addition, he is known to have studied [[geometry]] and learned to play musical instruments, including the [[lute]] and the [[virginals]]. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward's religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref> His religious establishment was probably chosen by [[Archbishop Thomas Cranmer]], a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were \"reformed\" Catholics or [[Erasmians]] and later became [[Marian exiles]]. By 1549, Edward had written a [[treatise]] on the pope as [[Antichrist]] and was making informed notes on theological controversies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=13\u201316}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> Many aspects of Edward's religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and reverence for images and relics of the saints.<ref name=\"Skidmore 2007 p=38\">{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=38}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Badge of Prince Edward 1543.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Prince of Wales's feathers|badge of Prince Edward]], from [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s ''Genethliacon illustrissimi Eaduerdi principis Cambriae'' (1543)]]\n\nBoth Edward's sisters were attentive to their brother and often visited him \u2013 on one occasion, Elizabeth gave him a shirt \"of her own working\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=26}}</ref> Edward \"took special content\" in Mary's company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; \"I love you most\", he wrote to her in 1546.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=38\u201337}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=16}}</ref> In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited.

Edward's surroundings and possessions were regally splendid: his rooms were hung with costly Flemish [[tapestries]], and his clothes, books, and cutlery were encrusted with precious jewels and gold.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=35\u201336}}</ref> Like his father, Edward was fascinated by military arts, and many of his portraits show him wearing a gold dagger with a jewelled hilt, in imitation of Henry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=36}}; {{Harvnb|Strong|1969|p=92}}.

The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]], arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called [[Kett's Rebellion|Robert Kett]], mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=70\u201383}}</ref> A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against [[enclosure|enclosing]] landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=347\u2013350}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=66\u201367, 86.}} For example, in Hereford, a man was recorded as saying that \"by the king's proclamation all enclosures were to be broken up\".</ref>\n\nThe same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west.

The procession was led by \"a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples\" and watched by Londoners \"wepyng and lamenting\"; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref> Edward's burial place was unmarked until as late as 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by [[Christ's Hospital]] school to commemorate their founder.

However, a minority prefer the terms \"evangelical\" or \"new\". In this view, as expressed by Diarmaid MacCulloch, it is \"premature to use the label 'Protestant' for the English movement of reform in the reigns of Henry and Edward, even though its priorities were intimately related to what was happening in central Europe. A description more true to the period would be'evangelical', a word which was indeed used at the time in various cognates\".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=2}}</ref>}} In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's [[Thirty-nine Articles|Forty-two Articles]] formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1962|p=212}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, [[Hugh Latimer]], and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref>\n\nQueen Mary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles.

Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary's councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Northumberland's former secretary, and [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]], Edward's old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon at the opening of parliament in 1559.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haigh|1993|p=238}}</ref> Parliament passed an [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer's prayer book of 1552;<ref>{{Harvnb|Somerset|1997|p=101}}</ref> and the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer's Forty-two Articles.

The council was first led by his uncle [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1547\u20131549), and then by [[John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick]] (1550\u20131553), who from 1551 was [[Duke of Northumberland]].\n\nEdward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in exchange for peace. The transformation of the [[Church of England]] into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, Henry{{nbsp}}VIII, had severed the link between the Church and [[Catholic Church|Rome]], Henry{{nbsp}}VIII had never permitted the renunciation of [[Catholic doctrine]] or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was [[established church|established]] for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the imposition of compulsory services in English.\n\nIn February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a \"Devise for the Succession\", to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his [[Cousin#Relationship charts|first cousin once removed]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. This decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary nine days after becoming queen. During her reign, Mary reversed Edward's Protestant reforms, which nonetheless became the basis of the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] of 1559.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Edward VI as a Child - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Prince Edward as a baby, depicted with regal splendour and a kingly gesture.

In addition, he is known to have studied [[geometry]] and learned to play musical instruments, including the [[lute]] and the [[virginals]]. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward's religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref> His religious establishment was probably chosen by [[Archbishop Thomas Cranmer]], a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were \"reformed\" Catholics or [[Erasmians]] and later became [[Marian exiles]]. By 1549, Edward had written a [[treatise]] on the pope as [[Antichrist]] and was making informed notes on theological controversies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=13\u201316}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> Many aspects of Edward's religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and reverence for images and relics of the saints.<ref name=\"Skidmore 2007 p=38\">{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=38}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Badge of Prince Edward 1543.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Prince of Wales's feathers|badge of Prince Edward]], from [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s ''Genethliacon illustrissimi Eaduerdi principis Cambriae'' (1543)]]\n\nBoth Edward's sisters were attentive to their brother and often visited him \u2013 on one occasion, Elizabeth gave him a shirt \"of her own working\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=26}}</ref> Edward \"took special content\" in Mary's company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; \"I love you most\", he wrote to her in 1546.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=38\u201337}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=16}}</ref> In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited.

The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]], arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called [[Kett's Rebellion|Robert Kett]], mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=70\u201383}}</ref> A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against [[enclosure|enclosing]] landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=347\u2013350}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=66\u201367, 86.}} For example, in Hereford, a man was recorded as saying that \"by the king's proclamation all enclosures were to be broken up\".</ref>\n\nThe same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west.

Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimise his authority.

In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant.{{efn|name=MacPr|The article follows the majority of historians in using the term \"Protestant\" for the Church of England as it stood by the end of Edward's reign. However, a minority prefer the terms \"evangelical\" or \"new\". In this view, as expressed by Diarmaid MacCulloch, it is \"premature to use the label 'Protestant' for the English movement of reform in the reigns of Henry and Edward, even though its priorities were intimately related to what was happening in central Europe. A description more true to the period would be'evangelical', a word which was indeed used at the time in various cognates\".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=2}}</ref>}} In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's [[Thirty-nine Articles|Forty-two Articles]] formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1962|p=212}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, [[Hugh Latimer]], and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref>\n\nQueen Mary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles. Despite her belief in the papal supremacy, she ruled constitutionally as the [[Supreme Head]] of the English Church, a contradiction under which she bridled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=378, 383}}</ref> She found herself entirely unable to restore the vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1962|pp=216\u2013219}}</ref> Although she burned a number of leading Protestant churchmen, many reformers either went into exile or remained subversively active in England during her reign, producing a torrent of reforming propaganda that she was unable to stem.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haigh|1993|p=223}}; {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=382\u2013383}}</ref> Nevertheless, Protestantism was not yet \"printed in the stomachs\" of the English people,<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=182}}; {{Harvnb|Haigh|1993|p=175}}</ref> and had Mary lived longer, her Catholic reconstruction might have succeeded, leaving Edward's reign, rather than hers, as a historical aberration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haigh|1993|p=235}}</ref>\n\nOn Mary's death in 1558, the English Reformation resumed its course, and most of the reforms instituted during Edward's reign were reinstated in the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary's councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Northumberland's former secretary, and [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]], Edward's old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon at the opening of parliament in 1559.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haigh|1993|p=238}}</ref> Parliament passed an [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer's prayer book of 1552;<ref>{{Harvnb|Somerset|1997|p=101}}</ref> and the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer's Forty-two Articles.

It is a co-production of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States. Set in early 18th century England, the film's plot examines the relationship between two cousins, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]] ([[Rachel Weisz]]) and [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Masham]] ([[Emma Stone]]), who are vying to be Court favourites of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] ([[Olivia Colman]]).

It was theatrically released in the United States on 23 November 2018 by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 1 January 2019. The film became a box office success, grossing $95 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.\n\n''The Favourite'' received widespread critical acclaim, with praise drawn towards its screenplay, Lanthimos' direction, cinematography, editing, costume design, production values, music, and the lead actresses' performances. It received [[List of accolades received by The Favourite|numerous awards and nominations]], including ten [[91st Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations (tying ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' for the most nominations of any film that year). ''The Favourite'' also won seven [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] (including [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Best British Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for Weisz) and ten [[British Independent Film Awards 2018|British Independent Film Awards]]. Colman won Best Actress at the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Awards]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globes]], and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTAs]]. The film was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2018]]. The film also won eight [[European Film Awards]] including [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[European Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[European Film Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Colman.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough by Jervas.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]].]]\n\nIn 1711, England is at [[War of the Spanish Succession|war with France]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] is in frail health; she shows little interest in governing, preferring activities such as racing ducks and playing with her 17 rabbits, surrogates for the children she miscarried or lost in childhood. Her confidante, adviser, and furtive lover Sarah Churchill effectively rules the country through her influence over the Queen. Sarah's efforts to control Anne are undermined by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], who as a landowner argues against a doubling of property taxes proposed to fund the war.\n\n[[File:Abigail Masham portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham]].]]\n\nAbigail Hill, Sarah's impoverished younger cousin, arrives in search of employment. Abigail's standing has been tainted by her father, who gambled her away in a game of [[whist]]. Abigail is forced to do menial work as a scullery maid in the palace. After seeing the Queen's [[gout]], Abigail forages for herbs and applies them to the Queen's inflamed legs. Sarah has Abigail whipped for entering the Queen's bedroom without permission but relents and appoints her [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] after realising the herbs have helped the Queen. Harley asks Abigail to spy on Sarah and the Queen, hoping to circumvent Sarah's authority. Abigail witnesses Sarah and the Queen having sex.\n\nWith Sarah focused on the war effort, Abigail kindles a friendship with Anne that becomes sexual. Sarah becomes aware of Abigail's machinations and attempts to send her away. Abigail drugs Sarah's tea, causing her to fall off her horse and be dragged unconscious on the ground. Sarah awakens in a brothel, battered from the fall. Anne, thinking Sarah has abandoned her to make her jealous, takes Abigail into her [[Favourite|favour]] and allows her to marry [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Colonel Masham]], reinstating Abigail's noble standing.\n\nWhen Sarah returns to court, she issues an ultimatum to Queen Anne: send Abigail away or Sarah will disclose her correspondence with Anne that details their sexual relationship. She tells Anne that Abigail does not love her and merely flatters her. Sarah, remorseful, burns the letters but Anne nevertheless sends her away from court. When Abigail, who has been promoted to [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], presents what she claims is evidence Sarah had been embezzling money, Anne exiles Sarah and her husband from Britain.\n\nWith Sarah gone and her position secure, Abigail begins to neglect and ignore Anne while indulging in court society and openly having affairs. One day, while lounging in the Queen's chamber, Abigail abuses one of Anne's rabbits. Anne, now very sick, is awakened by the animal's distress cry. Finally realising Abigail's cruel nature, Anne forces herself out of bed and orders Abigail to massage her leg while gradually bearing down on Abigail's head with her hand.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Olivia Colman]] as [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]\n* [[Emma Stone]] as [[Abigail Hill|Abigail]]\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Lady Sarah]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harley]]\n* [[Joe Alwyn]] as [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Masham]]\n* [[James Smith (actor)|James Smith]] as [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]]\n* [[Mark Gatiss]] as [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Marlborough]]\n* [[Jenny Rainsford]] as Mae\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nDeborah Davis wrote the first draft of ''The Favourite'' in 1998.

Lanthimos was attracted to Davis' and McNamara's script, and \"became acquainted with the three female characters who happened to be real people\".<ref name=\"colman\"/>  Lanthimos felt the story was interesting and also had a chance \"to create three complex female characters which is something you rarely see\".<ref name=\"colman\"/> Of her working relationship with Lanthimos, Dempsey said:\n\n{{quote|He has a very particular, contained view.

Almost a decade later, producer [[Ed Guiney]] obtained the script and was also attracted to the complex plot and relationships of the three women; he said, \"We didn't want to make just another British costume drama&nbsp;...&#0032;[we wanted] a story that felt contemporary and relevant and vibrant\u2014not something out of a museum\".<ref name=\"HWR_gnder\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Guiney became acquainted with Lanthimos, whose film ''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'' (2009) had received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].

Lanthimos immediately became intrigued with the idea \"[t]hese three women possessed power that affected the lives of millions\"; at the same time he found the story to be \"intimate\".<ref name=\"HWR_gnder\"/> Lanthimos began working closely with screenwriter [[Tony McNamara (writer)|Tony McNamara]] on \"freshening up\" the script.

The filmmakers used mostly natural lighting, which proved challenging for the candle-lit night time scenes; Crombie said, \"as you imagine, there are very strict protocols about managing candles&nbsp;... we had to use an enormous number of wax-catchers.

Powell wanted Abigail's rise to power to be reflected in her costumes; she said, \"I wanted to give her that vulgarity of the ''nouveau riche'', and her dresses get a little bolder and showier. There's more pattern involved and there are black-and-white stripes&nbsp;... I wanted her to stand out from everybody else as trying too hard\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/the-favourite-costumes-sandy-powell-interview/|title=How 'The Favourite' costumes added renegade 'punk' edge to Queen Anne's court|last=Nolfi|first=Joey|date=9 November 2018|website=EW.com|language=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204150223/https://ew.com/movies/the-favourite-costumes-sandy-powell-interview/|archive-date=4 December 2018|url-status=live|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref> Although the film's Queen Anne spends most of her time wearing a nightgown because she is ill, Powell wanted her to have an \"iconic\" look and constructed a robe made of [[ermine]], saying:\n<blockquote>This is the queen at her most queenly, in her ceremonial outfit&nbsp;... I looked at images and real things like it, and normally [this type of garment] would be solid gold, embroidered, and bejewelled, so I thought what else can I do just to give it an air of royalty? Ermine is associated with royalty, it's usually just used as a decoration in small amounts, so I decided to just cover her in it. Because in the rest of the film I have her in a nightgown, not bothering to get dressed every day.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough unintentional, Powell drew inspiration for Sarah's contrasting, feminine gowns and her masculine recreational attire from her previous designs for [[Tilda Swinton]]'s character in ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'' (1992); she said, \"I didn't think about it at the time, it was just subliminal. I do think there is a similarity between the two films because ''Orlando'' was the last unconventional period film I'd done, so there is a similarity.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Powell stated Lanthimos wanted the women in the film to have natural hair and faces but he wanted the men to wear considerable makeup and large wigs. He said; \"Normally films are filled with men and the women are the decoration in the background, and I've done many of those, so it was quite nice for it to be reversed this time where the women are the centre of the film and the men are the decoration in the background. Of course, they've got serious, important parts, but I think the frivolity of them is quite funny.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nPowell would deliver the costumes, check they fitted the actors and that the actors had no problems and would leave the set, as Lanthimos requested. She described his directing style:<blockquote>He knew he wanted to be left alone with his actors and his camera. A lot of the time I wasn't aware of how it was going to be. Even when you see the dailies, you can't really tell until it's all put together&nbsp;...

[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] is in frail health; she shows little interest in governing, preferring activities such as racing ducks and playing with her 17 rabbits, surrogates for the children she miscarried or lost in childhood. Her confidante, adviser, and furtive lover Sarah Churchill effectively rules the country through her influence over the Queen. Sarah's efforts to control Anne are undermined by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], who as a landowner argues against a doubling of property taxes proposed to fund the war.\n\n[[File:Abigail Masham portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham]].]]\n\nAbigail Hill, Sarah's impoverished younger cousin, arrives in search of employment. Abigail's standing has been tainted by her father, who gambled her away in a game of [[whist]]. Abigail is forced to do menial work as a scullery maid in the palace. After seeing the Queen's [[gout]], Abigail forages for herbs and applies them to the Queen's inflamed legs. Sarah has Abigail whipped for entering the Queen's bedroom without permission but relents and appoints her [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] after realising the herbs have helped the Queen. Harley asks Abigail to spy on Sarah and the Queen, hoping to circumvent Sarah's authority. Abigail witnesses Sarah and the Queen having sex.\n\nWith Sarah focused on the war effort, Abigail kindles a friendship with Anne that becomes sexual. Sarah becomes aware of Abigail's machinations and attempts to send her away. Abigail drugs Sarah's tea, causing her to fall off her horse and be dragged unconscious on the ground. Sarah awakens in a brothel, battered from the fall. Anne, thinking Sarah has abandoned her to make her jealous, takes Abigail into her [[Favourite|favour]] and allows her to marry [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Colonel Masham]], reinstating Abigail's noble standing.\n\nWhen Sarah returns to court, she issues an ultimatum to Queen Anne: send Abigail away or Sarah will disclose her correspondence with Anne that details their sexual relationship. She tells Anne that Abigail does not love her and merely flatters her. Sarah, remorseful, burns the letters but Anne nevertheless sends her away from court. When Abigail, who has been promoted to [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], presents what she claims is evidence Sarah had been embezzling money, Anne exiles Sarah and her husband from Britain.\n\nWith Sarah gone and her position secure, Abigail begins to neglect and ignore Anne while indulging in court society and openly having affairs. One day, while lounging in the Queen's chamber, Abigail abuses one of Anne's rabbits. Anne, now very sick, is awakened by the animal's distress cry. Finally realising Abigail's cruel nature, Anne forces herself out of bed and orders Abigail to massage her leg while gradually bearing down on Abigail's head with her hand.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Olivia Colman]] as [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]\n* [[Emma Stone]] as [[Abigail Hill|Abigail]]\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Lady Sarah]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harley]]\n* [[Joe Alwyn]] as [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Masham]]\n* [[James Smith (actor)|James Smith]] as [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]]\n* [[Mark Gatiss]] as [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Marlborough]]\n* [[Jenny Rainsford]] as Mae\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nDeborah Davis wrote the first draft of ''The Favourite'' in 1998.

I wanted her to stand out from everybody else as trying too hard\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/the-favourite-costumes-sandy-powell-interview/|title=How 'The Favourite' costumes added renegade 'punk' edge to Queen Anne's court|last=Nolfi|first=Joey|date=9 November 2018|website=EW.com|language=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204150223/https://ew.com/movies/the-favourite-costumes-sandy-powell-interview/|archive-date=4 December 2018|url-status=live|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref> Although the film's Queen Anne spends most of her time wearing a nightgown because she is ill, Powell wanted her to have an \"iconic\" look and constructed a robe made of [[ermine]], saying:\n<blockquote>This is the queen at her most queenly, in her ceremonial outfit&nbsp;... I looked at images and real things like it, and normally [this type of garment] would be solid gold, embroidered, and bejewelled, so I thought what else can I do just to give it an air of royalty? Ermine is associated with royalty, it's usually just used as a decoration in small amounts, so I decided to just cover her in it. Because in the rest of the film I have her in a nightgown, not bothering to get dressed every day.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough unintentional, Powell drew inspiration for Sarah's contrasting, feminine gowns and her masculine recreational attire from her previous designs for [[Tilda Swinton]]'s character in ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'' (1992); she said, \"I didn't think about it at the time, it was just subliminal. I do think there is a similarity between the two films because ''Orlando'' was the last unconventional period film I'd done, so there is a similarity.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Powell stated Lanthimos wanted the women in the film to have natural hair and faces but he wanted the men to wear considerable makeup and large wigs. He said; \"Normally films are filled with men and the women are the decoration in the background, and I've done many of those, so it was quite nice for it to be reversed this time where the women are the centre of the film and the men are the decoration in the background. Of course, they've got serious, important parts, but I think the frivolity of them is quite funny.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nPowell would deliver the costumes, check they fitted the actors and that the actors had no problems and would leave the set, as Lanthimos requested. She described his directing style:<blockquote>He knew he wanted to be left alone with his actors and his camera. A lot of the time I wasn't aware of how it was going to be. Even when you see the dailies, you can't really tell until it's all put together&nbsp;... But when it all comes together, you're like of course it was all going to come together, he knows exactly what he's doing. We were all part of the jigsaw and he could put all the pieces together.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe soundtrack of ''The Favourite'' consists mostly of [[Baroque music|baroque]] and [[Classical music|classical]] music, including pieces by [[W.

October 1916 \u2013 8 January 1996)<!--full dates in infobox, per MOS--> was a French statesman who served as [[President of France]] from 1981 to 1995, the longest time in office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain.

They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949.

Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], ''Le Syndrome de Vichy'', p.365</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand then served his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd r\u00e9giment d'infanterie coloniale. In 1938, he became the best friend of [[Georges Dayan]], a Jewish socialist, whom he saved from anti-Semitic aggressions by the national-royalist movement ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb, pp. 46/48</ref> His friendship with Dayan caused Mitterrand to begin to question some of his nationalist ideas. Finishing his law studies, he was sent in September 1939 to the [[Maginot line]] near [[Montm\u00e9dy]], with the rank of Sergeant-chief (infantry sergeant). He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942. Following an observation of Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became an [[agnostic]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiHLZQ6XtzEC|title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President|first=Ronald|last=Tiersky |date=1 January 2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|via=Google Books|isbn=9780742524736}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's actions during [[World War II]] were the cause of much controversy in France during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n===Prisoner of War: 1940\u20131941===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was at the end of his national service when the war broke out.

B\u00e9nouville was a member of the resistance groups ''[[Combat (French Resistance)|Combat]]'' and ''[[Noyautage des administrations publiques]]'' (NAP).\n\nIn late 1942, the non-occupied zone was invaded by the Germans.

In the spring of 1943, along with [[Gabriel Jeantet]], a member of Marshal P\u00e9tain's cabinet, and [[Simon Arbellot]] (both former members of La Cagoule), Mitterrand received the [[Order of the Francisque]] (the honorific distinction of the Vichy Regime).\n\nDebate rages in France as to the significance of this.

In his memoirs, he says that he had started this organisation while he was still officially working for the Vichy Regime.

When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]]. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but Mitterrand arranged for his \"escape\" and sent him back to France for treatment.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', \u00e9d.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Mend\u00e8s-France and Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

F; Mitterrand cloture sa campagne \u00e0 Toulouse. (1965) - 53Fi3417.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand in [[Toulouse]] on 17 December 1965 during the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]] campaign]]\n\nIn the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Reagan Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7&nbsp;million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.<ref>''Socialism, the State and Public Policy'' in France edited by Philip G.

As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period.<ref>''The Death of Politics: France under Mitterrand'' by John Laughland {{page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment.

A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Rocard led the moderate wing of the PS and he was the most popular of the Socialist politicians. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand decided to organize a new [[1988 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The PS obtained a relative parliamentary majority. Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]]. On 16 February 1993, President Mitterrand inaugurated in [[Fr\u00e9jus]] a memorial to the [[Indochina War|wars in Indochina]].\n\nBut the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the ''Mitterrandist'' group (at the [[Rennes Congress]], where supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the [[Infected blood scandal (France)|contaminated blood scandal]] which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Herv\u00e9, and the Elys\u00e9e wiretaps affairs.\n\n====Second Cohabitation====\nDisappointed with Rocard's apparent failure to enact the Socialists' programme, Mitterrand dismissed Rocard in 1991 and appointed [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] to replace him. She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also sharply criticized the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as the country's nuclear weapons buildup. When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand visited the USSR in November 1988, the Soviet media claimed to be 'leaving aside the virtually wasted decade and the loss of the [[France-Russia relations|Soviet-French]] 'special relationship' of the Gaullist era'.\n\nNevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was worried by the rapidity of the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc's]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]].

Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, [[Centre d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches internationales]] (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference.

[[Hassan II]], the king of Morocco, said for his part that \"Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it\", but that Western countries should \"help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.\"<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/B0100_-fiche22sommets.pdf Les 22 premi\u00e8res conf\u00e9rences des chefs d'Etat de France et d'Afrique], on French government website \u2013 URL accessed in January 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAll in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand \"one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area\", and on the other hand \"cooperation with France\", this despite \"incoherence and inconsistency, like any [[public policy]]\".<ref>[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/detail-memoire.html?ID=310 Le discours de la Baule et le pluralisme en Afrique noire francophone.

Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nMitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte. The court declared \"Les faits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sur ordre soit du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, soit des ministres de la D\u00e9fense successifs qui ont mis \u00e0 la disposition de ([[Christian Prouteau]]) tous les moyens de l'\u00c9tat afin de les ex\u00e9cuter\" (translation: these actions were committed following orders from the French President or his various Defence Ministers who gave [[Christian Prouteau]] full access to the state machinery so he could execute the orders) The court stated that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the principal instigator of the wire taps (l'inspirateur et le d\u00e9cideur de l'essentiel) and that he had ordered some of the taps and turned a blind eye to others and that none of the 3000 wiretaps carried out by the cell were legally obtained.<ref>''Les oreilles du Pr\u00e9sident'' de [[Jean-Marie Pontaut]] et [[J\u00e9rome Dupuis]], [[Fayard]], 1996.

office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway. He had three brothers, Robert, Jacques, and Philippe, and four sisters, Antoinette, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe, Colette, and Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's wife, [[Danielle Mitterrand]] (''n\u00e9e'' Gouze, 1924\u20132011), came from a socialist background and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949.

Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], ''Le Syndrome de Vichy'', p.365</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand then served his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd r\u00e9giment d'infanterie coloniale. In 1938, he became the best friend of [[Georges Dayan]], a Jewish socialist, whom he saved from anti-Semitic aggressions by the national-royalist movement ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb, pp. 46/48</ref> His friendship with Dayan caused Mitterrand to begin to question some of his nationalist ideas. Finishing his law studies, he was sent in September 1939 to the [[Maginot line]] near [[Montm\u00e9dy]], with the rank of Sergeant-chief (infantry sergeant). He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942.

From 27 November 1943 Mitterrand worked for the [[Bureau central de renseignements et d'action]].<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', tome 1, p. 102</ref> In December 1943 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ordered the execution of Henri Marlin (who was about to order attacks on the \"[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]\") by Jacques Paris and Jean Munier, who later hid out with Mitterrand's father.\n\nAfter a second visit to London in February 1944,Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took part in the liberation of Paris in August; he took over the headquarters of Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux prisonniers de guerre (general office for POW, the ministry he was working for), immediately he took up the vacant post of secretary general of POWs. When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]]. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but Mitterrand arranged for his \"escape\" and sent him back to France for treatment.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', \u00e9d.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Mend\u00e8s-France and Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

(1965) - 53Fi3417.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand in [[Toulouse]] on 17 December 1965 during the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]] campaign]]\n\nIn the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Reagan Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period.<ref>''The Death of Politics: France under Mitterrand'' by John Laughland {{page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment. Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on special work schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Cultural policy====\nWith respect to cultural policies, grants were allocated to non-profit associations and community cultural initiatives,<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Hijab and the Republic: Uncovering the French Headscarf Debate|author=Winter, B.|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-5132-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint/page/113 113]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Mitterrand [[Liberalization|liberalized]] the media, created the [[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel|CSA]] media regulation agency, and authorized [[pirate radios in France|pirate radio]] and the first private TV ([[Canal+]]), giving rise to the [[Media of France|private broadcasting]] sector.\n\nIn terms of the theatre, some transfer of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor,Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]]. On 16 February 1993, President Mitterrand inaugurated in [[Fr\u00e9jus]] a memorial to the [[Indochina War|wars in Indochina]].\n\nBut the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the ''Mitterrandist'' group (at the [[Rennes Congress]], where supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the [[Infected blood scandal (France)|contaminated blood scandal]] which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Herv\u00e9, and the Elys\u00e9e wiretaps affairs.\n\n====Second Cohabitation====\nDisappointed with Rocard's apparent failure to enact the Socialists' programme, Mitterrand dismissed Rocard in 1991 and appointed [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] to replace him. She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President,Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also sharply criticized the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as the country's nuclear weapons buildup.

When the [[European Court of Human Rights]] finally ruled against the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand doctrine, the policy had already led to most of the criminals never being punished for their crimes.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n====1990 speech at La Baule====\nResponding to a democratic movement in Africa after the 1989 fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he made his La Baule speech in June 1990 which tied [[development aid]] to democratic efforts from former French colonies, and during which he opposed the devaluation of the [[CFA Franc]]. Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, [[Centre d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches internationales]] (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference. [[Omar Bongo]], President of Gabon, declared that he would rather have \"events counsel him;\" [[Abdou Diouf]], President of Senegal, said that, according to him, the best solution was a \"strong government\" and a \"good faith opposition;\" the President of Chad, [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]] (nicknamed the \"African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]\") claimed that it was contradictory to demand that African states should simultaneously carry on a \"democratic policy\" and \"social and economic policies which limited their sovereignty\", in a clear allusion to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]'s \"[[structural adjustment]] programs\". [[Hassan II]], the king of Morocco, said for his part that \"Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it\", but that Western countries should \"help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.\"<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/B0100_-fiche22sommets.pdf Les 22 premi\u00e8res conf\u00e9rences des chefs d'Etat de France et d'Afrique], on French government website \u2013 URL accessed in January 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAll in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand \"one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area\", and on the other hand \"cooperation with France\", this despite \"incoherence and inconsistency, like any [[public policy]]\".<ref>[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/detail-memoire.html?ID=310 Le discours de la Baule et le pluralisme en Afrique noire francophone.

Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nMitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte. The court declared \"Les faits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sur ordre soit du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, soit des ministres de la D\u00e9fense successifs qui ont mis \u00e0 la disposition de ([[Christian Prouteau]]) tous les moyens de l'\u00c9tat afin de les ex\u00e9cuter\" (translation: these actions were committed following orders from the French President or his various Defence Ministers who gave [[Christian Prouteau]] full access to the state machinery so he could execute the orders) The court stated that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the principal instigator of the wire taps (l'inspirateur et le d\u00e9cideur de l'essentiel) and that he had ordered some of the taps and turned a blind eye to others and that none of the 3000 wiretaps carried out by the cell were legally obtained.<ref>''Les oreilles du Pr\u00e9sident'' de [[Jean-Marie Pontaut]] et [[J\u00e9rome Dupuis]], [[Fayard]], 1996.
