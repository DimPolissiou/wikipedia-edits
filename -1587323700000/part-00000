Speed and maneuverability are significant virtues in a cruising boat, and the N-41 has retained them.

She is the oldest of four children, and often tries to help take care of her 3 baby brothers; this has given her a tendency towards bossiness, which her friends do not always like, especially when she tries to take control of their games.\n*'''Matt''' - Matt is 7 years old, loves to play sports, and is very energetic in everything he does. He is very curious, full of ideas and opinions, and very mischievous, which means he is often getting into trouble.  He has an older sister named Nina who often teases him.\n\n===Big Friends===\n*'''Golias''' - Golias, Yuri's Big Big Friend, is a large, round, blue [[elephant]]. Golias is affectionate, likes to act, dress up, try new things and play outdoors. He is also very timid, and gnashes his teeth in fear if the lights are out. He loves to give Yuri trunk rides, and is quite sad if he ever feels left out. In Spanish he is called Goliat.\n*'''Nessa''' - Nessa is Lili's Big Big Friend.  She is a pink [[giraffe]] who can make friends with anyone, and is optimistic and cheerful. Nessa also lets Lili ride on her neck. She is agreeable and mediates conflicts.\n*'''Bongo''' - Matt's Big Big Friend is named Bongo; he is a green [[Kangaroo]]. Like Matt, he is athletic, energetic and constantly jumping.  He has a great sense of humor and an infectious, uncontrollable laugh.  Bongo is afraid of being ignored and likes attention. Bongo is also very fearful. He has a pouch that Matt rides in despite the fact he is a male kangaroo. His pouch is apparently in more than one spot, since Bongo can be seen pulling things out or putting things into different pouches in various locations, such as, up by his neck, down at his sides (almost like pockets).\n\n==Cast==\n===Canada===\n* Yuri - [[Nissae Isen]]\n* Matt - [[Gage Munroe]]\n* Lili - [[Addison Holley]]\n* Golias - [[Keanu Reeves]]\n* Bongo - [[Rick Miller (comedian)|Rick Miller]]\n* Nessa - [[Tajja Isen]]\n\n===Brazil===\n* Yuri - [[Fernanda Ribeiro (voice actor)|Fernanda Ribeiro]]\n* Matt - [[Eduardo Drummond]]\n* Lili - [[Anna Rita Cerqueira]]\n* Golias - [[M\u00e1rcio Sim\u00f5es]]\n* Bongo - [[S\u00e9rgio Stern]]\n* Nessa - [[Lina Mendes]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{expand section|date=December 2016}}\n===Season 1===\n*Episode 1: Brickle Pickle, All the way up\n*Episode 2: Hippo-licious/Clowning Around \n*Episode 3: Air Buddies/The Sneakers\n\n<br />\n\n*Episode 4: Skipping Stones/No Kid is an Island \n*Episode 5: Show and Tell/Perfect Princess \n*Episode 6: Count Glerm/Hair Brained Idea\n*Episode 12: Fort Messy, Beach Blast\n*Episode 13: Finders Keepers\n*Episode 14: Music Man, Dream On\n*Episode 15: King of the Monkeys\n*Episode 16: It's My Party, Doggy Duty\n<ref name=11-16>https://web.archive.org/web/20140214065545/http://www.rogersondemand.com/OnDemand/Show/my_big_big_friend?lang=en\nEP 15 King of the Monkeys Aired on 01/13/14\nEP 14 Music Man, Dream On Aired on 01/13/14\nEP 16 It's My Party, Doggy Duty Aired on 01/13/14\nEP 13 Finders Keepers Aired on 12/11/13\nEP 12 Fort Messy, Beach Blast Aired on 12/11/13\nEP 11 Faeries of the Forest Aired on 12/11/13</ref>\n*17-19 TBA\n*Episode 20: Lili Bee Flower Power\n*Episode 21: No My Game, Manly Matt\n*Episode 22: Stickers, Matt's Fun Park\n*Episode 23: Big and Small, Super Lilly, Valentine's Day{{fact|date=December 2016}}\n*Episode 24: The Boat Ride, Hot and Cold\n*Episode 25: Super Lili, Holding It In\n*Episode 26: You Can't Make Me, Toy Drive\n*Episode 27: Harold the Hamster, The Caterpillar\n*Episode 28: Toybreaker, Stuck\n*Episode 29: Ready, Set...No!\n*Episode 30: Hooray for You, No Way, Karate\n*Episode 31: Teacher Trouble, A Knightly Thing to Do\n*Episode 32: One and Only, Sand and Flowers\n<ref name=20-24,26-32>https://web.archive.org/web/20140613090937/http://www.rogersondemand.com/OnDemand/Show/my_big_big_friend?lang=en\nEP 28 Toybreaker, Stuck Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 29 Ready, Set...No!, Orange and Purple Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 30 Hooray for You, No Way, Karate Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 32 One and Only, Sand and Flowers Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 31 Teacher Trouble, A Knightly Thing to Do Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 23 Big and Small, Super Lilly Aired on 04/09/14\nEP 24 The Boat Ride, Hot and Cold Aired on 04/09/14\nEP 26 You Can't Make Me, Toy Drive Aired on 04/09/14\nEP 27 Harold the Hamster, The Caterpillar...

He is smart, independent and happy, and has a very fertile imagination.  He is an only child, and as a result is sometimes lonely, and can be a little selfish.\n*'''Lili''' - Lili is almost 6 years old, very determined and loyal, and often speaks before she thinks.  She is the oldest of four children, and often tries to help take care of her 3 baby brothers; this has given her a tendency towards bossiness, which her friends do not always like, especially when she tries to take control of their games.\n*'''Matt''' - Matt is 7 years old, loves to play sports, and is very energetic in everything he does. He is very curious, full of ideas and opinions, and very mischievous, which means he is often getting into trouble.  He has an older sister named Nina who often teases him.\n\n===Big Friends===\n*'''Golias''' - Golias, Yuri's Big Big Friend, is a large, round, blue [[elephant]]. Golias is affectionate, likes to act, dress up, try new things and play outdoors. He is also very timid, and gnashes his teeth in fear if the lights are out. He loves to give Yuri trunk rides, and is quite sad if he ever feels left out. In Spanish he is called Goliat.\n*'''Nessa''' - Nessa is Lili's Big Big Friend.  She is a pink [[giraffe]] who can make friends with anyone, and is optimistic and cheerful. Nessa also lets Lili ride on her neck. She is agreeable and mediates conflicts.\n*'''Bongo''' - Matt's Big Big Friend is named Bongo; he is a green [[Kangaroo]]. Like Matt, he is athletic, energetic and constantly jumping.  He has a great sense of humor and an infectious, uncontrollable laugh.  Bongo is afraid of being ignored and likes attention. Bongo is also very fearful. He has a pouch that Matt rides in despite the fact he is a male kangaroo. His pouch is apparently in more than one spot, since Bongo can be seen pulling things out or putting things into different pouches in various locations, such as, up by his neck, down at his sides (almost like pockets).\n\n==Cast==\n===Canada===\n* Yuri - [[Nissae Isen]]\n* Matt - [[Gage Munroe]]\n* Lili - [[Addison Holley]]\n* Golias - [[Scott McCord]]\n* Bongo - [[Rick Miller (comedian)|Rick Miller]]\n* Nessa - [[Tajja Isen]]\n\n===Brazil===\n* Yuri - [[Fernanda Ribeiro (voice actor)|Fernanda Ribeiro]]\n* Matt - [[Eduardo Drummond]]\n* Lili - [[Anna Rita Cerqueira]]\n* Golias - [[M\u00e1rcio Sim\u00f5es]]\n* Bongo - [[S\u00e9rgio Stern]]\n* Nessa - [[Lina Mendes]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{expand section|date=December 2016}}\n===Season 1===\n*Episode 1: Brickle Pickle, All the way up\n*Episode 2: Hippo-licious/Clowning Around \n*Episode 3: Air Buddies/The Sneakers\n\n<br />\n\n*Episode 4: Skipping Stones/No Kid is an Island \n*Episode 5: Show and Tell/Perfect Princess \n*Episode 6: Count Glerm/Hair Brained Idea\n*Episode 12: Fort Messy, Beach Blast\n*Episode 13: Finders Keepers\n*Episode 14: Music Man, Dream On\n*Episode 15: King of the Monkeys\n*Episode 16: It's My Party, Doggy Duty\n<ref name=11-16>https://web.archive.org/web/20140214065545/http://www.rogersondemand.com/OnDemand/Show/my_big_big_friend?lang=en\nEP 15 King of the Monkeys Aired on 01/13/14\nEP 14 Music Man, Dream On Aired on 01/13/14\nEP 16 It's My Party, Doggy Duty Aired on 01/13/14\nEP 13 Finders Keepers Aired on 12/11/13\nEP 12 Fort Messy, Beach Blast Aired on 12/11/13\nEP 11 Faeries of the Forest Aired on 12/11/13</ref>\n*17-19 TBA\n*Episode 20: Lili Bee Flower Power\n*Episode 21: No My Game, Manly Matt\n*Episode 22: Stickers, Matt's Fun Park\n*Episode 23: Big and Small, Super Lilly, Valentine's Day{{fact|date=December 2016}}\n*Episode 24: The Boat Ride, Hot and Cold\n*Episode 25: Super Lili, Holding It In\n*Episode 26: You Can't Make Me, Toy Drive\n*Episode 27: Harold the Hamster, The Caterpillar\n*Episode 28: Toybreaker, Stuck\n*Episode 29: Ready, Set...No!\n*Episode 30: Hooray for You, No Way, Karate\n*Episode 31: Teacher Trouble, A Knightly Thing to Do\n*Episode 32: One and Only, Sand and Flowers\n<ref name=20-24,26-32>https://web.archive.org/web/20140613090937/http://www.rogersondemand.com/OnDemand/Show/my_big_big_friend?lang=en\nEP 28 Toybreaker, Stuck Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 29 Ready, Set...No!, Orange and Purple Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 30 Hooray for You, No Way, Karate Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 32 One and Only, Sand and Flowers Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 31 Teacher Trouble, A Knightly Thing to Do Aired on 05/01/14\nEP 23 Big and Small, Super Lilly Aired on 04/09/14\nEP 24 The Boat Ride, Hot and Cold Aired on 04/09/14\nEP 26 You Can't Make Me, Toy Drive Aired on 04/09/14\nEP 27 Harold the Hamster, The Caterpillar...

It is about a young girl who has accidentally passed through an opening into another dimension. Her parents and their friend attempt to locate and retrieve her.\n\n==Opening narration==\n{{cquote|Missing: one frightened little girl. Name: Bettina Miller. Description: six years of age, average height and build, light brown hair, quite pretty. Last seen being tucked in bed by her mother a few hours ago. Last heard: 'ay, there's the rub,' as [[Hamlet]] put it. For Bettina Miller can be heard quite clearly, despite the rather curious fact that she can't be seen at all. Present location? Let's say for the moment... in the Twilight Zone.}}\n\n==Plot==\nA married couple, Chris and Ruth Miller, are awakened by the whimpering of their little daughter, Tina. Chris goes to see what the trouble is.  Their dog, Mack, begins to bark from the backyard. Chris cannot find Tina either in or under the bed, even though her pleas for help seem to be coming from nearby, yet far away. He calls Ruth into the room, and she is similarly mystified. Chris phones his [[physicist]] =friend, Bill, for help, and opens the door to let the incessantly barking Mack into the house. The dog runs under the bed and disappears, but can still be heard barking, again close, but far away. \n\nBill arrives and helps Chris move the bed so that he can physically scan the area where it was, marking the legs with books. When this proves fruitless, Bill examines the wall behind the bed. His hand passes easily  through the wall and to another dimension, and draws marks on the wall outlining the apparent boundary. He explains to Chris and Ruth that sometimes lines in our three dimensions end parallel with, rather than perpendicular to, the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]. He warns them that they know nothing of what's beyond this portal, and should they follow Tina into the fourth dimension, they would only become hopelessly lost as well, since it is not manifested like the third dimension.\n\nChris calls to Mack to guide Tina back. Mack leads Tina to the source of Chris's voice, but they still cannot find the entrance. Despite Bill's warnings, Chris reaches into the portal and falls into the fourth dimension, an abstract, crystalline landscape which seems distorted, and constantly turning upside down and sideways. Bill advises him not to move. Chris sees Tina and Mack and calls them towards him. Bill calls for him to hurry. When Tina and Mack close in on Chris, Bill grabs them and pulls them back into the bedroom. Ruth rushes Tina to another room.\n\nBill explains that Chris was only halfway through the portal, despite Chris' perception that he was standing up in the new dimension. Bill was in fact holding onto Chris the entire time. He was telling Chris to hurry because the portal was closing. Bill knocks on the wall, and it is solid. The portal has closed. Bill tells Chris, \"Another few seconds, and half of you would have been here, and the other half...\"\n\n==Closing narration==\n{{cquote|The other half ''where''? The fourth dimension? The fifth? Perhaps. They never found the answer. Despite a battery of research physicists equipped with every device known to man, electronic and otherwise, no result was ever achieved, except perhaps a little more respect for and uncertainty about the mechanisms of the Twilight Zone.}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe opening is slightly altered beginning with this episode. The graphics and words are the same, but there are subtle differences in the acoustics for the theme music. \n\nMatheson wrote the short story based on a real-life incident involving his young daughter, who fell off her bed while asleep and rolled against a wall. Despite hearing her daughter's cries for help, Matheson's wife was initially unable to locate her daughter.\n\nThe voice of Tina in the alternate dimension was played by voice actor Rhoda Williams, who was then 32 years old. During the opening narration the outline to the fourth dimension is behind Rod Serling, indicating that the opening narration was filmed last.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe critic [[Camille Paglia]] calls \"Little Girl Lost\" the \"first great script\" of ''The Twilight Zone'' in ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990).<ref>Sexual Personae, Yale University Press, 1990, p. 344</ref>\n\n==References in other media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}\n\n\"Little Girl Lost\" was parodied in \"Homer<sup>3</sup>\", a segment of \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\", an episode from the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode, the two-dimensional characters attempt to retrieve [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] from the [[dimension|third dimension]]. Homer likens the entrance to the third dimension to \"something out of that twilighty show about that zone\".\n\nAn area of the queue for the [[Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]] theme park attractions in California and [[Walt Disney Studios Park|Paris]] uses subtle effects to simulate air currents coming out of a solid wall, as well as playing a subtle recording of the little girl's dialogue at intervals. In the exit area of the Florida version of the attraction, there is an area of the wall outlined in chalk, exactly like the portal in the episode.\n\nSome (including Richard Matheson) have noted similarities between the episode and the 1982 film ''Poltergeist''. <ref>http://www.poltergeist.poltergeistiii.com/wrote.html</ref>\n\n==Theoretical basis==\nAlthough not intended by the writers, the hole into the other dimension was later given as an example of a [[Cut locus (Riemannian manifold)|\"Riemannian cut\"]],<ref>Kaku, Michio, ''Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps and the 10th Dimension'' Oxford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-508514-0}} p.42</ref> which is a type of [[wormhole]] formed when two spaces join at the same set of points.\n\n==Music==\nBernard Herrmann's score for the episode is written for an unusual chamber ensemble of four flutes (doubling on piccolos, and alto and bass flutes), four harps, percussion (one player, utilizing tambourine, tam-tams, and vibraphone), and [[viola d'amore]].  It has been performed as a concert suite by the [[San Francisco Composers Chamber Orchestra]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*DeVoe, Bill. (2008). ''Trivia from The Twilight Zone''.

He explains to Chris and Ruth that sometimes lines in our three dimensions end parallel with, rather than perpendicular to, the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]. He warns them that they know nothing of what's beyond this portal, and should they follow Tina into the fourth dimension, they would only become hopelessly lost as well, since it is not laid out like the third dimension.\n\nChris calls to Mack to guide Tina back. Mack leads Tina to the source of Chris's voice, but they still cannot find the entrance. Despite Bill's warnings, Chris reaches into the portal and falls into the fourth dimension, an abstract, crystalline landscape which seems distorted, and constantly turning upside down and sideways. Bill advises him not to move. Chris sees Tina and Mack and calls them towards him. Bill calls for him to hurry. When Tina and Mack close in on Chris, Bill grabs them and pulls them back into the bedroom. Ruth takes Tina to another room.\n\nBill explains that Chris was only halfway through the portal, despite Chris' perception that he was standing up in the new dimension. Bill was in fact holding onto Chris the entire time. He was telling Chris to hurry because the portal was closing. Bill knocks on the wall, and it is solid. The portal has closed. Bill tells Chris, \"Another few seconds, and half of you would have been here, and the other half...\"\n\n==Closing narration==\n{{cquote|The other half ''where''? The fourth dimension? The fifth? Perhaps. They never found the answer. Despite a battery of research physicists equipped with every device known to man, electronic and otherwise, no result was ever achieved, except perhaps a little more respect for and uncertainty about the mechanisms of the Twilight Zone.}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe opening is slightly altered beginning with this episode. The graphics and words are the same, but there are subtle differences in the acoustics for the theme music. \n\nMatheson wrote the short story based on a real-life incident involving his young daughter, who fell off her bed while asleep and rolled against a wall. Despite hearing her daughter's cries for help, Matheson's wife was initially unable to locate her daughter.\n\nThe voice of Tina in the alternate dimension was played by voice actor Rhoda Williams, who was then 32 years old. During the opening narration the outline to the fourth dimension is behind Rod Serling, indicating that the opening narration was filmed last.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe critic [[Camille Paglia]] calls \"Little Girl Lost\" the \"first great script\" of ''The Twilight Zone'' in ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990).<ref>Sexual Personae, Yale University Press, 1990, p. 344</ref>\n\n==References in other media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}\n\n\"Little Girl Lost\" was parodied in \"Homer<sup>3</sup>\", a segment of \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\", an episode from the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode, the two-dimensional characters attempt to retrieve [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] from the [[dimension|third dimension]]. Homer likens the entrance to the third dimension to \"something out of that twilighty show about that zone\".\n\nAn area of the queue for the [[Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]] theme park attractions in California and [[Walt Disney Studios Park|Paris]] uses subtle effects to simulate air currents coming out of a solid wall, as well as playing a subtle recording of the little girl's dialogue at intervals. In the exit area of the Florida version of the attraction, there is an area of the wall outlined in chalk, exactly like the portal in the episode.\n\nSome (including Richard Matheson) have noted similarities between the episode and the 1982 film ''Poltergeist''. <ref>http://www.poltergeist.poltergeistiii.com/wrote.html</ref>\n\n==Theoretical basis==\nAlthough not intended by the writers, the hole into the other dimension was later given as an example of a [[Cut locus (Riemannian manifold)|\"Riemannian cut\"]],<ref>Kaku, Michio, ''Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps and the 10th Dimension'' Oxford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-508514-0}} p.42</ref> which is a type of [[wormhole]] formed when two spaces join at the same set of points.\n\n==Music==\nBernard Herrmann's score for the episode is written for an unusual chamber ensemble of four flutes (doubling on piccolos, and alto and bass flutes), four harps, percussion (one player, utilizing tambourine, tam-tams, and vibraphone), and [[viola d'amore]].  It has been performed as a concert suite by the [[San Francisco Composers Chamber Orchestra]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*DeVoe, Bill. (2008). ''Trivia from The Twilight Zone''.

Artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics.

The character battles an extensive rogues' gallery, primarily archenemies [[Doctor Sivana]], [[Black Adam]], and [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]].\n\nBased on comic book sales, the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even [[Superman]].<ref name=\"TiptonMoviePoopShoot\">{{cite web | last=Tipton | first=Scott | title=The World's Mightiest Mortal | work=Comics 101 | date=April 1, 2003 | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=I've always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s. | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050614004150/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | archivedate=June 14, 2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"ComicSuccessMuseum\">{{cite web | title=Comic Book Success Stories | work=The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | url= http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | accessdate= 2005-06-17 | quote=By the middle of the decade, Captain Marvel had received a self-titled comic book, ''Captain Marvel's Adventures'' [sic],<!--the proper name of the publication is \"Captain Marvel Adventures\"--> which had a circulation that reached 1.3 million copies per month.

Besides penning stories featuring his creations [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]], and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes. Each superhero in this team possessed a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.<ref name=\"JohnnyShazam\"/>\n\nFawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called \"'''Captain Thunder'''\".<ref name=\"JohnnyShazam\">{{cite web | last=Hembeck | first=Fred | title=Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work=The Hembeck Files | date=June 18, 2003 | url=http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2.html | accessdate=2005-06-22}}</ref> Staff artist [[C.

Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark \"Captain Thunder\", \"Flash Comics\", or \"Thrill Comics\", because all three names were already in use. Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to \"Captain Marvelous\", which the editors shortened to \"'''Captain Marvel'''\". The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as \"Captain Marvel\".\n\n====Introduction====\n''Whiz Comics'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939. ''Captain Marvel,'' the comic's lead feature, introduced audiences to Billy Batson, an orphaned 12-year-old boy who, by speaking the name of the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], is struck by a magic lightning bolt and transformed into the adult superhero Captain Marvel. Shazam's name was an acronym derived from the six immortal elders who grant Captain Marvel his superpowers: [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]].\n\nIn addition to introducing the main character, his alter ego, and his mentor, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter with station WHIZ. ''Captain Marvel'' was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"ComicSuccessMuseum\"/> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', the premiere issue of which was written and drawn by [[Joe Simon]] & [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/1178/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Captain Marvel Adventures #[1] |website=www.comics.org |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> Captain Marvel continued to appear in ''Whiz Comics'', as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''[[Master Comics]]''.\n\n====Inspiration and success at Fawcett====\n[[Image:WhizComicsNo22.jpg|right|thumb|''Whiz Comics'' #22 (Oct. 1941), featuring Captain Marvel and his young alter-ego, Billy Batson.

Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called [[Marvelman]]. Captain Marvel Jr. was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word \"Shazam!\" was replaced with \"Kimota\" (\"Atomik\" spelled backwards). The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number #25.\n\n''Marvelman'' ceased publication in 1963, but the character was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Beginning in 1985, Moore's black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by [[Eclipse Comics]] under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' (as [[Marvel Comics]] objected to the use of \"Marvel\" in the title), and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior''{{'}}s demise. Within the [[Metatextuality|metatextual]] story line of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]].

This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html |title=An Oral History of DC's CAPTAIN MARVEL/SHAZAM: The New Beginning Years |last=Smith |first=Zack |date=2017-09-05 |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051645/https://www.newsarama.com/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html |archive-date=2017-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story arc featured in the short-lived anthology ''[[Action Comics Weekly]]'' #623\u2013626 (October 25, 1988 \u2013 November 15, 1988), in which a [[Neo-Nazi]] version of Captain Nazi was introduced.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new ''Shazam!'' ongoing series.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> Though ''New Beginning'' had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas.<ref name=\"ThomasIntro\"/> As a result, Thomas's intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new [[Punk subculture|punk]]-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \"Spike\") who was not Billy's sister, and an [[African-American]] take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the ''Shazam!'' project.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\">{{cite journal\n | last = Thomas\n | first = Roy\n | authorlink =\n |author2= Jerry Ordway\n | title = Not Your Father's Captain Marvel!

Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]]' and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series, which depicted the latest adventures of the world's first superhero team, the [[Justice Society of America]], with Captain Marvel also briefly joining the team to keep an eye on his old nemesis. Captain Marvel also appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the sequel to Miller's highly acclaimed graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which culminated in his death. The ''[[Superman/Shazam: First Thunder]]'' miniseries, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-''Crisis'' meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.\n \nThe Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise. In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the [[Rock of Eternity]]. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters. ''52'' introduced Adam's \"Black Marvel Family,\" which included Adam's wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], her brother [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and [[Sobek (character)|Sobek]]. The series chronicled Adam's attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] after she and Osiris are killed. The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and [[Doug Braithwaite]], published from 2005 to 2007.\n\n===''The Trials of Shazam!''===\n\n{{Main|The Trials of Shazam!}}\n\n''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue maxi-series written by [[Judd Winick]] and illustrated by [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter]] for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008. The series redefined the ''Shazam!'' property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism. ''Trials of Shazam!'' featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name ''Marvel,'' while the former Captain Marvel Jr., Freddy Freeman, attempts to prove himself worthy to become Marvel's champion under the name ''Shazam.''\n\nIn the pages of the 2007\u20132008 ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless [[Mary Batson]] his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel. By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008\u20132009 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God [[DeSaad]], becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain [[Darkseid]] and fighting both [[Supergirl]] and Freddy Freeman/Shazam.\n\nA three-issue arc in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) undid many of the ''Trials of Shazam!'' changes. Issues 23 through 25 of ''Justice Society'' featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis defeating Marvel and taking over the Rock of Eternity. Adam and Isis recruit the now-evil Mary Marvel to help them in the ensuing fight against a now-powerless Billy Batson and the Justice Society.\n\nBilly and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009\u20132010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' saga in a one-shot special, ''The Power of Shazam!'' #48.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (Jan. 2010)</ref> In 2011, DC published a one-shot ''Shazam!'' story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]]. Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in ''Titans'' (vol. 2) #32 the same year.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #32 (Feb. 2011)</ref>\n\n===The ''New 52'' relaunch===\n[[Image:Justice League 0 Shazam Alt Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Alternate cover for ''[[Justice League]]'' (Vol. 2) #0 (Nov. 2012).

In his new origin story, Billy Batson is a moody and troubled 15-year-old foster child living in [[Philadelphia]] who has gone through several foster homes.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #7 (May 2012)</ref> At his newest foster home under Victor and Rosa V\u00e1zquez, Billy gains five foster siblings: \"den mother\" Mary Bromfield, trickster and pick-pocket Freddy Freeman, shy and quiet Pedro Pe\u00f1a, brainy Eugene Choi, and energetic Darla Dudley.<ref name=\"JL8\">''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #8 (April 2012)</ref> When the evil Dr. Sivana unleashes the ancient magical warrior Black Adam from his tomb,<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #9 (July 2012)</ref> the Wizard of the Rock of Eternity\u2014the last of a council of beings who once controlled magic\u2014begins abducting candidates to assess them for the job of being his champion.

In desperation and seeing the \"embers of good\" within Billy, the dying Wizard passes on his powers and teaches Billy they can be accessed through the magic word \"Shazam\" when spoken with good intentions. After saying the magic word, Billy is struck by a bolt of lightning which transforms him into Shazam, a super-powered adult possessing super-strength, flight, and vast magical powers. The Wizard dies and Shazam is transported back to Earth, where Billy reveals his new secret to Freddy. The two scheme to make money and score beer with Shazam's new powers, but Shazam is instead led to crime scenes where he is needed as a hero. Shazam and Freddy have a falling out when Shazam refuses to change back into Billy, and as soon as Freddy heads back home, Shazam is attacked by Black Adam.<ref name=\"JL0\"/> Billy is saved only by mending his relationships with Freddy, Mary, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla. When Adam again attacks, unleashing the Seven Deadly Sins on downtown Philadelphia and threatening to kill the other kids, Billy shares his powers with them, who all become magic-powered adult superheroes (except for Darla, who remains a child).<ref name=\"JL21\"/> Ultimately, Billy goads Adam into saying the magic word and transforming into his human form, at which point he promptly turns to dust.<ref name=\"JL21\">''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #21 (2013)</ref> Although he had contemplated running away, Billy decides to stay with his new family, having learned to be a better and more open person.<ref name=\"JL21\"/>\n\nCommencing the \"[[Trinity War]]\" story line, Billy flies to Black Adam's home nation of [[Kahndaq]] to bury Adam's remains. Shazam's entry into the country is interpreted by the locals as illegal US entry into their territory. This leads to run-ins with both the independent Justice League and the US-sponsored Justice League of America (JLA), and a series of events that see the opening of [[Pandora's Box]], a portal to [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]] which brings the evil Justice League analogues of the [[Crime Syndicate]] to Earth-0.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #22\u201323 (2013)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 3) #6 (2013)</ref> Following the successful defeat of the Crime Syndicate, Shazam is inducted into the League.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #30 (2014)</ref> While still a newcomer to the league, Billy has a number of new adventures while under the mentorship of [[Victor Stone|Cyborg]], who becomes one of his best friends.<ref name=\"Justice League #31 2014\">''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #31 (2014)</ref>\n\nAfter a year of living in the V\u00e1zquez home, Billy and his foster siblings have taken to having fun fighting crime around Philadelphia as the Shazam Family.

Billy is also able to share his powers with others.\n\nThough the link to the specific mythological figures is de-emphasized in some modern-day stories, traditionally the letters in the name ''Shazam'' each represent a specific superhuman ability:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''S''' || for the Wisdom of '''S'''olomon || Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge.

From this, he can read and decipher any coding, solve long mathematical equations instantaneously, and make intuitive guesses based on limited data, which are almost always correct. He also has a great understanding of divine phenomena in the mortal world, an uncanny awareness of his circumstances akin to clairvoyance that lets him turn disadvantages into advantages, and can provide counselling and advice in times of need. In some stories, this power also gives him the ability to hypnotize people.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #18 (1941)</ref>\n|-\n|'''H''' || for the Strength of '''H'''ercules || The might of [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] grants superhuman strength comparable to that of the legendary demigod, making him one of DC Comics' strongest characters.

He has a supernaturally-endowed [[metabolism]] far beyond the normal realm of human physical activities, doesn't require nourishment or even air (although he can partake of them for personal enjoyment), and he can even survive unaided in space. Sustained by the magical energies coursing through his body, Billy's empowered form never ages, making him biologically immortal and he can potentially live forever with no decline in performance so long as he remains in that form, although his normal self will continue to age.<ref name=\"WFC 257\">''World's Finest Comics'' #257 (1979)</ref>\n|-\n|'''Z''' || for the Power of '''Z'''eus || [[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel/Shazam, also greatly enhances Captain Marvel/Shazam's other physical and mental abilities, including his five senses, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks.<ref name=\"WFC 254\">''World's Finest Comics'' #254 (1979)</ref> The hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996)</ref><ref>''Shazam!'' #28 (1977)</ref> The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to the hero, and providing fuel for magic spells.

Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled [[pastiche]] of Marvel\u2014down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named \"Willie Fawcett\" (a reference to Fawcett Comics), and a magic word (\"Thunder!\"), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying \"Thunder\". His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), [[Uncas]] (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity). Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.\n\n\"Make Way for Captain Thunder\" was written by Elliot S! Maggin and illustrated by [[Curt Swan]] and Bob Oskner. At the time of its publication, DC had been printing ''Shazam!'' comics for 18 months, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in ''Justice League of America'' #137, two years later (although he met [[Lex Luthor]] in ''Shazam!'' #15, November/December 1974).\n\n===Captain Thunder (1982)===\nIn 1983, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC's main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson named \"Willie Fawcett\" (as in the 1974 story), who spoke the magic word \"Shazam!\" to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One's Mightiest Mortal.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> This alternate version of the character was never used.\n\n===''Elseworld's Finest'' (1998)===\nIn the alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] one-shot comic ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' (1998) by Tom Simmons, Matt Haley and Barbara Kesel, the current Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African-American man. A flashback to the older Justice Society features the traditional Caucasian Captain Marvel, leading to the conclusion that there were two Captain Marvels.\n\n===''Superman: Distant Fires'' (1998)===\nIn the dark alternate future of the [[Elseworlds]] comic ''Superman: Distant Fires'' (1998) by [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Gil Kane]], [[Kevin Nowlan]], and [[Matt Hollingsworth]], most of humanity has been destroyed in nuclear war. An adult Billy Batson becomes obsessed with Wonder Woman when they become part of a small community of survivors of the holocaust, with most of the surviving superhumans having lost their powers or dealing with altered abilities. When the now-powerless Clark Kent joins their community, starting a relationship with Wonder Woman that includes them having a child together, Batson's resentment of Superman becomes insanity, as he provokes his transformation into Captain Marvel despite use of this power causing damage to Earth.\n\n===''The Dark Knight Strikes Again'' (2001-2002)===\nIn the dark alternate future shown in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 2001\u20132002 comic miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses. Lex Luthor, who has captured Mary Marvel, coerces him into working for him by threatening to kill her. During an alien attack on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson\u2014here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him\u2014died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist. His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.\n\n===''Kingdom Come''===\nThe 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', written by [[Mark Waid]] with painted art by [[Alex Ross]], depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is an adult who now matches the appearance of his superhero identity. The human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Batson has become the brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind's mind-controlling worm offspring to keep him in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson's potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, believing it is a non-costumed Captain Marvel that serves Luthor.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #3 (1996). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nEvents finally cause him to transform into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel\u2014spurred by Superman telling him that due to his ties to both humanity and the superhuman community, he is the only one capable of choosing which one to save\u2014intercepts the bomb and summons his lightning to detonate it while it is still airborne, sacrificing himself to save as many lives as possible, both human and metahuman. The nuclear blast still kills a large number of heroes, but does cool the war-like attitudes of the survivors.

Teamed with the beautiful, and much tougher, fellow agent, Carla Noral, the two of them are in India searching for the megalomaniac master criminal Gunga Kahn. Rogers is given the ability to transform into a large, winged being by saying the magic word \"Shazam!\" This version is co-created with Gary Frank, and is based on the Bill Parker\u2013C. C.

Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash's accomplice [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], who is revealed to be a traitor.

Prime Earth's [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Injustice League|his team]] sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape over his mouth, allowing Alexander to speak the magic word \"Mazahs!\" and transform into his muscular, highly powerful alter-ego. While Prime Earth's Shazam is known for sharing his powers with others, Mazahs kills other superbeings and takes their powers for his own, as when he kills the Syndicate's speedster [[Johnny Quick]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Earth-3's Wonder Woman analogue, [[Superwoman]], is in a relationship with Alexander and tricked her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team, but Prime Earth Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning, using a lightning-rod that Batman had retrieved to try and use against Johnny Quick based on his planned defense against the Flash, and transform Mazahs into his human form.

The story ends with the orphaned baby having absorbed both the Omega Effect from Lex Luthor as well as the [[Anti-Life Equation]] from Justice League associate [[Steve Trevor]], transforming him into a resurrected\u2014yet still infantile\u2014Darkseid.<ref>''Justice League'' #50.

Similar to the Golden Age version, this Shazam is suggested to have two personalities: Billy Batson is a separate person from Shazam. In Year One he, like the Flash, is somewhat skeptical of Superman's intentions, as his actions are often immoral. Ultimately, Shazam decides to stay and support the Regime, devoted to its cause. He becomes the object of Harley Quinn's affection, being bound and gagged by her in Year Four.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2016/05/13/injustice-gods-among-us-year-five-chapter-21/ |title=Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year Five Chapter 21 Review |date=2016-05-13 |website=Bam Smack Pow |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> He is freed by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] to join the Regime in combating the Amazon army and Greek gods, but just when they seem to be winning Zeus strips him of his powers, reverting him to Billy permanently.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/injustice-gods-among-us/256603/injustice-gods-among-us-deaths |title=The Many Deaths of Injustice: Gods Among Us |website=Den of Geek |language=en |access-date=2018-09-23}}</ref> He, Harley (for trying to help him), and Wonder Woman's mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] are sent to the abyss of [[Tartarus (DC Comics)|Tartarus]] as punishment, though they escape and Billy is left out of the conflict without his powers.

The character had a more substantial role in the 2009 animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', based on a ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book arc in which Marvel battles Superman under orders from United States President Lex Luthor. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. An uncredited [[Rachael MacFarlane]] voiced Billy Batson.\n* An evil version of Captain Marvel, named '''Captain Super''', has a minor role in the 2010 animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]].''

H! A! Z! A! M! kids as supporting characters. Apart, each child has a facet of SHAZAM's power: Eugene Choi (wisdom of '''S'''olomon), Pedro Pe\u00f1a (strength of '''H'''ercules), Mary Bromfield (stamina of '''A'''tlas), Freddy Freeman (power of '''Z'''eus), Billy Batson (courage of '''A'''chilles), and Darla Dudley (speed of '''M'''ercury). Together, they form Captain Thunder. Pedro Pe\u00f1a and Billy Batson are voiced by [[Candi Milo]] and [[Jennifer Hale]], respectively, with '''Captain Thunder''' voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. The children travel to London, now an Amazon stronghold, along with resistance heroes Cyborg, Batman and the Flash. They combine into Captain Thunder and fight Wonder Woman 1v1, ending in Wonder Woman using her lasso to compel Captain Thunder to revert back into the children. Batson is killed immediately afterwards, while the other children are either killed by Wonder Woman offscreen or vaporized with every other combatant when Aquaman detonates his desperation weapon (powered by a captive Captain Atom), razing the entire battlefield. Nonetheless, the Flash escapes and races back in time, preventing the Flashpoint timeline's existence and also the SHAZAM kids' deaths.\n* In 2014, the character\u2014now renamed Shazam\u2014appeared in the animated film ''[[Justice League: War]]''.

In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League, but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman.

Superman destroys the device, but its remains are examined and it turns out to really be a generator. Despite Superman trying to apologize, Captain Marvel quits the Justice League in disgust claiming that they aren't like the heroes he admired anymore. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Captain Marvel has been only used because the clash between the two superheroes was part of a big plot organized by Lex Luthor and [[Amanda Waller]] to discredit Superman.\n* Later, Captain Marvel made eight appearances in Cartoon Network's ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' series, which ran from 2010 to 2013.

According to Boyar's faint memories in a 2011 interview, the show was initially produced in New York but after about a month relocated to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcripts of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian [[Jim Harmon]] via recollections of old-time radio fans who recalled hearing it during original broadcasts, plus locating period program listings.<ref>Hamerlinck, P.C.

Art by [[Andy Kubert]]]]\n\nCaptain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[pop culture]] in general. The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories. The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman's [[Heat vision (fiction)|heat vision]], X-ray vision or superhuman breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.\n\nThe National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in \"[[Superduperman]]\",<ref>Wright, p. 146.</ref> a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April/May 1953). Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature. Marbles' magic word is \"SHAZOOM\", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x (power of), '''O'''x (power of another), and '''M'''oney. In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal. Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.\n\nWhile publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name. He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free.<ref>''Superman'' #276 (June 1974)</ref> Two years later, ''Justice League of America'' #135\u2013137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies. It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly. [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] has caused Superman to go mad using red [[kryptonite]], compelling Marvel to battle him at first and subsequently restore Superman's mind with the help of lightning.\n\nIn ''Shazam!'' #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of ''[[Action Comics]]''. He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.\n\nNotable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (1978), ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #36\u201337 (1984), and ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' [[Superman vol. 2|vol. 2]], #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes. The \"Clash\" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece, Lex Luthor manipulating events so that Captain Marvel will perceive Superman as being prejudced against Luthor's criminal past and attacking him without provokation or evidence that Luthor has actually done anything wrong. By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the ''Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder'' miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Cimino |first = John |title = Superman vs. Captain Marvel The Definitive Write-Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics |journal= Back Issue! |issue = 66 |pages = 69\u201377 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing |date = August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|United States|Television|Animation|Cartoon|Film|Comics|Toys|Speculative fiction|1950s|1960s|1980s|1990s}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Beck | first1=C.

Artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. He is the alter ego of '''Billy Batson''', a boy who, by speaking the magic word \"'''SHAZAM!'''\" (acronym of six \"immortal elders\": [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules (DC Comics)|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (DC Comics)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus (DC Comics)|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and [[Hermes (DC Comics)|'''M'''ercury]]), can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight and other abilities. The character battles an extensive rogues' gallery, primarily archenemies [[Doctor Sivana]], [[Black Adam]], and [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]].\n\nBased on comic book sales, the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even [[Superman]].<ref name=\"TiptonMoviePoopShoot\">{{cite web | last=Tipton | first=Scott | title=The World's Mightiest Mortal | work=Comics 101 | date=April 1, 2003 | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=I've always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s. | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050614004150/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | archivedate=June 14, 2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"ComicSuccessMuseum\">{{cite web | title=Comic Book Success Stories | work=The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | url= http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | accessdate= 2005-06-17 | quote=By the middle of the decade, Captain Marvel had received a self-titled comic book, ''Captain Marvel's Adventures'' [sic],<!--the proper name of the publication is \"Captain Marvel Adventures\"--> which had a circulation that reached 1.3 million copies per month.

Besides penning stories featuring his creations [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]], and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes. Each superhero in this team possessed a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.<ref name=\"JohnnyShazam\"/>\n\nFawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called \"'''Captain Thunder'''\".<ref name=\"JohnnyShazam\">{{cite web | last=Hembeck | first=Fred | title=Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work=The Hembeck Files | date=June 18, 2003 | url=http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2.html | accessdate=2005-06-22}}</ref> Staff artist [[C. C. Beck|Charles Clarence \"C. C.\" Beck]] was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat [[cartoon]]y style that became his trademark. \"When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett's first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were,\" Beck told an interviewer. \"We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/an-interview-with-c-c-beck/ |title=An Interview with C.

Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark \"Captain Thunder\", \"Flash Comics\", or \"Thrill Comics\", because all three names were already in use. Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to \"Captain Marvelous\", which the editors shortened to \"'''Captain Marvel'''\". The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as \"Captain Marvel\".\n\n====Introduction====\n''Whiz Comics'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939. ''Captain Marvel,'' the comic's lead feature, introduced audiences to Billy Batson, an orphaned 12-year-old boy who, by speaking the name of the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], is struck by a magic lightning bolt and transformed into the adult superhero Captain Marvel. Shazam's name was an acronym derived from the six immortal elders who grant Captain Marvel his superpowers: [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]].\n\nIn addition to introducing the main character, his alter ego, and his mentor, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter with station WHIZ. ''Captain Marvel'' was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"ComicSuccessMuseum\"/> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', the premiere issue of which was written and drawn by [[Joe Simon]] & [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/1178/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Captain Marvel Adventures #[1] |website=www.comics.org |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> Captain Marvel continued to appear in ''Whiz Comics'', as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''[[Master Comics]]''.\n\n====Inspiration and success at Fawcett====\n[[Image:WhizComicsNo22.jpg|right|thumb|''Whiz Comics'' #22 (Oct. 1941), featuring Captain Marvel and his young alter-ego, Billy Batson.

Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called [[Marvelman]]. Captain Marvel Jr. was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word \"Shazam!\" was replaced with \"Kimota\" (\"Atomik\" spelled backwards). The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number #25.\n\n''Marvelman'' ceased publication in 1963, but the character was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Beginning in 1985, Moore's black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by [[Eclipse Comics]] under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' (as [[Marvel Comics]] objected to the use of \"Marvel\" in the title), and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior''{{'}}s demise. Within the [[Metatextuality|metatextual]] story line of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]].

This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html |title=An Oral History of DC's CAPTAIN MARVEL/SHAZAM: The New Beginning Years |last=Smith |first=Zack |date=2017-09-05 |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051645/https://www.newsarama.com/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html |archive-date=2017-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story arc featured in the short-lived anthology ''[[Action Comics Weekly]]'' #623\u2013626 (October 25, 1988 \u2013 November 15, 1988), in which a [[Neo-Nazi]] version of Captain Nazi was introduced.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new ''Shazam!'' ongoing series.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> Though ''New Beginning'' had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas.<ref name=\"ThomasIntro\"/> As a result, Thomas's intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new [[Punk subculture|punk]]-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \"Spike\") who was not Billy's sister, and an [[African-American]] take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the ''Shazam!'' project.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\">{{cite journal\n | last = Thomas\n | first = Roy\n | authorlink =\n |author2= Jerry Ordway\n | title = Not Your Father's Captain Marvel!

Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]]' and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series, which depicted the latest adventures of the world's first superhero team, the [[Justice Society of America]], with Captain Marvel also briefly joining the team to keep an eye on his old nemesis. Captain Marvel also appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the sequel to Miller's highly acclaimed graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which culminated in his death. The ''[[Superman/Shazam: First Thunder]]'' miniseries, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-''Crisis'' meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.\n \nThe Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise. In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the [[Rock of Eternity]]. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters. ''52'' introduced Adam's \"Black Marvel Family,\" which included Adam's wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], her brother [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and [[Sobek (character)|Sobek]]. The series chronicled Adam's attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] after she and Osiris are killed. The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and [[Doug Braithwaite]], published from 2005 to 2007.\n\n===''The Trials of Shazam!''===\n\n{{Main|The Trials of Shazam!}}\n\n''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue maxi-series written by [[Judd Winick]] and illustrated by [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter]] for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008. The series redefined the ''Shazam!'' property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism. ''Trials of Shazam!'' featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name ''Marvel,'' while the former Captain Marvel Jr., Freddy Freeman, attempts to prove himself worthy to become Marvel's champion under the name ''Shazam.''\n\nIn the pages of the 2007\u20132008 ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless [[Mary Batson]] his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel. By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008\u20132009 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God [[DeSaad]], becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain [[Darkseid]] and fighting both [[Supergirl]] and Freddy Freeman/Shazam.\n\nA three-issue arc in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) undid many of the ''Trials of Shazam!'' changes. Issues 23 through 25 of ''Justice Society'' featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis defeating Marvel and taking over the Rock of Eternity. Adam and Isis recruit the now-evil Mary Marvel to help them in the ensuing fight against a now-powerless Billy Batson and the Justice Society.\n\nBilly and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009\u20132010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' saga in a one-shot special, ''The Power of Shazam!'' #48.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (Jan. 2010)</ref> In 2011, DC published a one-shot ''Shazam!'' story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]]. Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in ''Titans'' (vol. 2) #32 the same year.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #32 (Feb. 2011)</ref>\n\n===The ''New 52'' relaunch===\n[[Image:Justice League 0 Shazam Alt Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Alternate cover for ''[[Justice League]]'' (Vol. 2) #0 (Nov. 2012).

In his new origin story, Billy Batson is a moody and troubled 15-year-old foster child living in [[Philadelphia]] who has gone through several foster homes.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #7 (May 2012)</ref> At his newest foster home under Victor and Rosa V\u00e1zquez, Billy gains five foster siblings: \"den mother\" Mary Bromfield, trickster and pick-pocket Freddy Freeman, shy and quiet Pedro Pe\u00f1a, brainy Eugene Choi, and energetic Darla Dudley.<ref name=\"JL8\">''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #8 (April 2012)</ref> When the evil Dr. Sivana unleashes the ancient magical warrior Black Adam from his tomb,<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #9 (July 2012)</ref> the Wizard of the Rock of Eternity\u2014the last of a council of beings who once controlled magic\u2014begins abducting candidates to assess them for the job of being his champion.

In desperation and seeing the \"embers of good\" within Billy, the dying Wizard passes on his powers and teaches Billy they can be accessed through the magic word \"Shazam\" when spoken with good intentions. After saying the magic word, Billy is struck by a bolt of lightning which transforms him into Shazam, a super-powered adult possessing super-strength, flight, and vast magical powers. The Wizard dies and Shazam is transported back to Earth, where Billy reveals his new secret to Freddy. The two scheme to make money and score beer with Shazam's new powers, but Shazam is instead led to crime scenes where he is needed as a hero. Shazam and Freddy have a falling out when Shazam refuses to change back into Billy, and as soon as Freddy heads back home, Shazam is attacked by Black Adam.<ref name=\"JL0\"/> Billy is saved only by mending his relationships with Freddy, Mary, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla. When Adam again attacks, unleashing the Seven Deadly Sins on downtown Philadelphia and threatening to kill the other kids, Billy shares his powers with them, who all become magic-powered adult superheroes (except for Darla, who remains a child).<ref name=\"JL21\"/> Ultimately, Billy goads Adam into saying the magic word and transforming into his human form, at which point he promptly turns to dust.<ref name=\"JL21\">''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #21 (2013)</ref> Although he had contemplated running away, Billy decides to stay with his new family, having learned to be a better and more open person.<ref name=\"JL21\"/>\n\nCommencing the \"[[Trinity War]]\" story line, Billy flies to Black Adam's home nation of [[Kahndaq]] to bury Adam's remains. Shazam's entry into the country is interpreted by the locals as illegal US entry into their territory. This leads to run-ins with both the independent Justice League and the US-sponsored Justice League of America (JLA), and a series of events that see the opening of [[Pandora's Box]], a portal to [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]] which brings the evil Justice League analogues of the [[Crime Syndicate]] to Earth-0.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #22\u201323 (2013)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 3) #6 (2013)</ref> Following the successful defeat of the Crime Syndicate, Shazam is inducted into the League.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #30 (2014)</ref> While still a newcomer to the league, Billy has a number of new adventures while under the mentorship of [[Victor Stone|Cyborg]], who becomes one of his best friends.<ref name=\"Justice League #31 2014\">''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #31 (2014)</ref>\n\nAfter a year of living in the V\u00e1zquez home, Billy and his foster siblings have taken to having fun fighting crime around Philadelphia as the Shazam Family.

Billy is also able to share his powers with others.\n\nThough the link to the specific mythological figures is de-emphasized in some modern-day stories, traditionally the letters in the name ''Shazam'' each represent a specific superhuman ability:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''S''' || for the Wisdom of '''S'''olomon || Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge.

From this, he can read and decipher any coding, solve long mathematical equations instantaneously, and make intuitive guesses based on limited data, which are almost always correct. He also has a great understanding of divine phenomena in the mortal world, an uncanny awareness of his circumstances akin to clairvoyance that lets him turn disadvantages into advantages, and can provide counselling and advice in times of need. In some stories, this power also gives him the ability to hypnotize people.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #18 (1941)</ref>\n|-\n|'''H''' || for the Strength of '''H'''ercules || The might of [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] grants superhuman strength comparable to that of the legendary demigod, making him one of DC Comics' strongest characters.

He has a supernaturally-endowed [[metabolism]] far beyond the normal realm of human physical activities, doesn't require nourishment or even air (although he can partake of them for personal enjoyment), and he can even survive unaided in space. Sustained by the magical energies coursing through his body, Billy's empowered form never ages, making him biologically immortal and he can potentially live forever with no decline in performance so long as he remains in that form, although his normal self will continue to age.<ref name=\"WFC 257\">''World's Finest Comics'' #257 (1979)</ref>\n|-\n|'''Z''' || for the Power of '''Z'''eus || [[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel/Shazam, also greatly enhances Captain Marvel/Shazam's other physical and mental abilities, including his five senses, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks.<ref name=\"WFC 254\">''World's Finest Comics'' #254 (1979)</ref> The hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996)</ref><ref>''Shazam!'' #28 (1977)</ref> The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to the hero, and providing fuel for magic spells.

Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled [[pastiche]] of Marvel\u2014down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named \"Willie Fawcett\" (a reference to Fawcett Comics), and a magic word (\"Thunder!\"), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying \"Thunder\". His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), [[Uncas]] (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity). Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.\n\n\"Make Way for Captain Thunder\" was written by Elliot S! Maggin and illustrated by [[Curt Swan]] and Bob Oskner. At the time of its publication, DC had been printing ''Shazam!'' comics for 18 months, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in ''Justice League of America'' #137, two years later (although he met [[Lex Luthor]] in ''Shazam!'' #15, November/December 1974).\n\n===Captain Thunder (1982)===\nIn 1983, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC's main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson named \"Willie Fawcett\" (as in the 1974 story), who spoke the magic word \"Shazam!\" to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One's Mightiest Mortal.<ref name=\"AlterEgo9Article\"/> This alternate version of the character was never used.\n\n===''Elseworld's Finest'' (1998)===\nIn the alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] one-shot comic ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' (1998) by Tom Simmons, Matt Haley and Barbara Kesel, the current Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African-American man. A flashback to the older Justice Society features the traditional Caucasian Captain Marvel, leading to the conclusion that there were two Captain Marvels.\n\n===''Superman: Distant Fires'' (1998)===\nIn the dark alternate future of the [[Elseworlds]] comic ''Superman: Distant Fires'' (1998) by [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Gil Kane]], [[Kevin Nowlan]], and [[Matt Hollingsworth]], most of humanity has been destroyed in nuclear war. An adult Billy Batson becomes obsessed with Wonder Woman when they become part of a small community of survivors of the holocaust, with most of the surviving superhumans having lost their powers or dealing with altered abilities. When the now-powerless Clark Kent joins their community, starting a relationship with Wonder Woman that includes them having a child together, Batson's resentment of Superman becomes insanity, as he provokes his transformation into Captain Marvel despite use of this power causing damage to Earth.\n\n===''The Dark Knight Strikes Again'' (2001-2002)===\nIn the dark alternate future shown in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 2001\u20132002 comic miniseries ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses. Lex Luthor, who has captured Mary Marvel, coerces him into working for him by threatening to kill her. During an alien attack on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson\u2014here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him\u2014died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist. His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.\n\n===''Kingdom Come''===\nThe 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', written by [[Mark Waid]] with painted art by [[Alex Ross]], depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is an adult who now matches the appearance of his superhero identity. The human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Batson has become the brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind's mind-controlling worm offspring to keep him in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson's potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, believing it is a non-costumed Captain Marvel that serves Luthor.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #3 (1996). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nEvents finally cause him to transform into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel\u2014spurred by Superman telling him that due to his ties to both humanity and the superhuman community, he is the only one capable of choosing which one to save\u2014intercepts the bomb and summons his lightning to detonate it while it is still airborne, sacrificing himself to save as many lives as possible, both human and metahuman. The nuclear blast still kills a large number of heroes, but does cool the war-like attitudes of the survivors.

Teamed with the beautiful, and much tougher, fellow agent, Carla Noral, the two of them are in India searching for the megalomaniac master criminal Gunga Kahn. Rogers is given the ability to transform into a large, winged being by saying the magic word \"Shazam!\" This version is co-created with Gary Frank, and is based on the Bill Parker\u2013C. C.

Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash's accomplice [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], who is revealed to be a traitor.

Prime Earth's [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Injustice League|his team]] sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape over his mouth, allowing Alexander to speak the magic word \"Mazahs!\" and transform into his muscular, highly powerful alter-ego. While Prime Earth's Shazam is known for sharing his powers with others, Mazahs kills other superbeings and takes their powers for his own, as when he kills the Syndicate's speedster [[Johnny Quick]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Earth-3's Wonder Woman analogue, [[Superwoman]], is in a relationship with Alexander and tricked her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team, but Prime Earth Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning, using a lightning-rod that Batman had retrieved to try and use against Johnny Quick based on his planned defense against the Flash, and transform Mazahs into his human form.

The story ends with the orphaned baby having absorbed both the Omega Effect from Lex Luthor as well as the [[Anti-Life Equation]] from Justice League associate [[Steve Trevor]], transforming him into a resurrected\u2014yet still infantile\u2014Darkseid.<ref>''Justice League'' #50.

Similar to the Golden Age version, this Shazam is suggested to have two personalities: Billy Batson is a separate person from Shazam. In Year One he, like the Flash, is somewhat skeptical of Superman's intentions, as his actions are often immoral. Ultimately, Shazam decides to stay and support the Regime, devoted to its cause. He becomes the object of Harley Quinn's affection, being bound and gagged by her in Year Four.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2016/05/13/injustice-gods-among-us-year-five-chapter-21/ |title=Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year Five Chapter 21 Review |date=2016-05-13 |website=Bam Smack Pow |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> He is freed by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] to join the Regime in combating the Amazon army and Greek gods, but just when they seem to be winning Zeus strips him of his powers, reverting him to Billy permanently.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/injustice-gods-among-us/256603/injustice-gods-among-us-deaths |title=The Many Deaths of Injustice: Gods Among Us |website=Den of Geek |language=en |access-date=2018-09-23}}</ref> He, Harley (for trying to help him), and Wonder Woman's mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] are sent to the abyss of [[Tartarus (DC Comics)|Tartarus]] as punishment, though they escape and Billy is left out of the conflict without his powers.

The character had a more substantial role in the 2009 animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', based on a ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book arc in which Marvel battles Superman under orders from United States President Lex Luthor. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. An uncredited [[Rachael MacFarlane]] voiced Billy Batson.\n* An evil version of Captain Marvel, named '''Captain Super''', has a minor role in the 2010 animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]].''

H! A! Z! A! M! kids as supporting characters. Apart, each child has a facet of SHAZAM's power: Eugene Choi (wisdom of '''S'''olomon), Pedro Pe\u00f1a (strength of '''H'''ercules), Mary Bromfield (stamina of '''A'''tlas), Freddy Freeman (power of '''Z'''eus), Billy Batson (courage of '''A'''chilles), and Darla Dudley (speed of '''M'''ercury). Together, they form Captain Thunder. Pedro Pe\u00f1a and Billy Batson are voiced by [[Candi Milo]] and [[Jennifer Hale]], respectively, with '''Captain Thunder''' voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. The children travel to London, now an Amazon stronghold, along with resistance heroes Cyborg, Batman and the Flash. They combine into Captain Thunder and fight Wonder Woman 1v1, ending in Wonder Woman using her lasso to compel Captain Thunder to revert back into the children. Batson is killed immediately afterwards, while the other children are either killed by Wonder Woman offscreen or vaporized with every other combatant when Aquaman detonates his desperation weapon (powered by a captive Captain Atom), razing the entire battlefield. Nonetheless, the Flash escapes and races back in time, preventing the Flashpoint timeline's existence and also the SHAZAM kids' deaths.\n* In 2014, the character\u2014now renamed Shazam\u2014appeared in the animated film ''[[Justice League: War]]''.

In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League, but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman.

Superman destroys the device, but its remains are examined and it turns out to really be a generator. Despite Superman trying to apologize, Captain Marvel quits the Justice League in disgust claiming that they aren't like the heroes he admired anymore. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Captain Marvel has been only used because the clash between the two superheroes was part of a big plot organized by Lex Luthor and [[Amanda Waller]] to discredit Superman.\n* Later, Captain Marvel made eight appearances in Cartoon Network's ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' series, which ran from 2010 to 2013.

According to Boyar's faint memories in a 2011 interview, the show was initially produced in New York but after about a month relocated to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcripts of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian [[Jim Harmon]] via recollections of old-time radio fans who recalled hearing it during original broadcasts, plus locating period program listings.<ref>Hamerlinck, P.C.

Art by [[Andy Kubert]]]]\n\nCaptain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[pop culture]] in general. The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories. The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman's [[Heat vision (fiction)|heat vision]], X-ray vision or superhuman breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.\n\nThe National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in \"[[Superduperman]]\",<ref>Wright, p. 146.</ref> a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April/May 1953). Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature. Marbles' magic word is \"SHAZOOM\", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x (power of), '''O'''x (power of another), and '''M'''oney. In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal. Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.\n\nWhile publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name. He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free.<ref>''Superman'' #276 (June 1974)</ref> Two years later, ''Justice League of America'' #135\u2013137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies. It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly. [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] has caused Superman to go mad using red [[kryptonite]], compelling Marvel to battle him at first and subsequently restore Superman's mind with the help of lightning.\n\nIn ''Shazam!'' #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of ''[[Action Comics]]''. He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.\n\nNotable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (1978), ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #36\u201337 (1984), and ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' [[Superman vol. 2|vol. 2]], #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes. The \"Clash\" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece, Lex Luthor manipulating events so that Captain Marvel will perceive Superman as being prejudced against Luthor's criminal past and attacking him without provokation or evidence that Luthor has actually done anything wrong. By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the ''Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder'' miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Cimino |first = John |title = Superman vs. Captain Marvel The Definitive Write-Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics |journal= Back Issue! |issue = 66 |pages = 69\u201377 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing |date = August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|United States|Television|Animation|Cartoon|Film|Comics|Toys|Speculative fiction|1950s|1960s|1980s|1990s}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Beck | first1=C.

He governed [[Tanganyika]] as Prime Minister from 1961 to 1962 and then as President from 1963 to 1964, after which he led its successor state, [[Tanzania]], as President from 1964 to 1985. A founding member of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) party\u2014which in 1977 became the [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] party\u2014he chaired it until 1990. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|African socialist]], he promoted a political philosophy known as [[Ujamaa]].\n\nBorn in [[Butiama]], then in the British colony of Tanganyika, Nyerere was the son of a [[Zanaki people|Zanaki]] chief. After completing his schooling, he studied at [[Makerere College]] in Uganda and then [[Edinburgh University]] in Scotland. In 1952 he returned to Tanganyika, married, and worked as a teacher. In 1954, he helped form TANU, through which he campaigned for Tanganyikan independence from the [[British Empire]]. Influenced by the [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]], Nyerere preached non-violent protest to achieve this aim. Elected to the Legislative Council in the [[1958\u201359 Tanganyikan general election|1958\u20131959 elections]], Nyerere then led TANU to victory at the [[1960 Tanganyikan general election|1960 general election]], becoming Prime Minister. Negotiations with the British authorities resulted in Tanganyikan independence in 1961. In 1962, Tanganyika became a republic, with Nyerere elected its first president. His administration pursued [[decolonisation]] and the \"Africanisation\" of the civil service while promoting unity between indigenous Africans and the country's Asian and European minorities. He encouraged the formation of a [[one-party state]] and unsuccessfully pursued the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] formation of an [[East African Federation]] with Uganda and Kenya. A 1963 mutiny within the army was suppressed with British assistance.\n\nFollowing the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of 1964, the island of [[Zanzibar]] was unified with Tanganyika to form Tanzania. After this, Nyerere placed a growing emphasis on national self-reliance and socialism. Although his socialism differed from that promoted by [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], Tanzania developed close links with [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China|Marxist\u2013governed China]]. In 1967, Nyerere issued the [[Arusha Declaration]] which outlined his vision of ujamaa. Banks and other major industries and companies were nationalised; education and healthcare were significantly expanded. Renewed emphasis was placed on agricultural development through the formation of communal farms, although these reforms hampered food production and left Tanzania dependent on foreign food aid. His government provided training and aid to anti-colonialist groups fighting white-minority rule throughout southern Africa and oversaw [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|Tanzania's 1978\u20131979 war with Uganda]] which resulted in the overthrow of Ugandan President [[Idi Amin]]. In 1985, Nyerere stood down and was succeeded by [[Ali Hassan Mwinyi]], who reversed many of Nyerere's policies. He remained chair of Chama Cha Mapinduzi until 1990, supporting a transition to a [[multi-party system]], and later served as mediator in attempts to end the [[Burundian Civil War]].\n\nNyerere was a controversial figure. Across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist and in power received praise for ensuring that, unlike many of its neighbours, Tanzania remained stable and unified in the decades following independence. His construction of the one-party state and use of [[detention without trial]] led to accusations of [[dictator]]ial governance, while he has also been blamed for economic mismanagement. He is held in deep respect within Tanzania, where he is often referred to by the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[honorific]] ''Mwalimu'' (\"teacher\") and described as the \"Father of the Nation\".\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1922\u20131934===\n\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere was born on 13 April 1922 in Mwitongo, an area of the village of [[Butiama]] in [[Tanganyika]]'s [[Mara Region]].{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1pp=11, 37\u201338|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2015|2p=24|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=27}}{{efn|Nyerere was not aware of his date of birth for much of his life; he claimed that he was born in February 1921 for at least his first twenty-five years. He discovered his actual date of birth in the late 1960s, when it was revealed that a local elder, Mtokambali Bukiri, had made a note of it in his medical records for the community.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=37\u201338}} }} He was one of 25 surviving children of Nyerere Burito, the chief of the [[Zanaki people]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=40|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=12}} Burito had been born in 1860 and given the name \"Nyerere\" (\"[[caterpillar]]\" in Zanaki) after a plague of worm caterpillars infested the local area at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=32}} Burito had been appointed chief in 1915, installed in that position by the German imperial administrators of what was then [[German East Africa]];{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=32}} his position was also endorsed by the incoming British imperial administration.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=33}} Burito had 22 wives, of whom Julius' mother, Mugaya Nyang'ombe, was the fifth.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=13, 34}} She had been born in 1892 and had married the chief in 1907, when she was fifteen.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1p=34|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=27}} Mugaya bore Burito four sons and four daughters, of which Nyerere was the second child; two of his siblings died in infancy.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=40}}\n\nThese wives lived in various huts around Burito's cattle corral, in the centre of which was his roundhouse.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=13}} The Zanaki were one of the smallest of the 120 tribes in the British colony and were then sub-divided among eight [[chiefdom]]s; they would only be united under the kingship of Chief [[Wanzagi Nyerere]], Burito's half-brother, in the 1960s.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=125}} Nyerere's clan were the Abhakibhweege.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=12}} At birth, Nyerere was given the personal name \"Mugendi\" (\"Walker\" in Zanaki) but this was soon changed to \"Kambarage\", the name of a female rain spirit, at the advice of a ''omugabhu'' [[divination|diviner]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=38}} Nyerere was raised into the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] belief system of the Zanaki,{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=16\u201317}} and lived at his mother's house, assisting in the farming of the millet, maize and cassava.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=38}} With other local boys he also took part in the herding of goats and cattle.{{sfnm|1a1=Assensoh|1y=1998|1p=125|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=39|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=28}} At some point he underwent the Zanaki's traditional [[circumcision]] ritual at [[Gabizuryo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1p=38|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=28}} As the son of a chief he was exposed to African-administered power and authority,{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=41}} and living in the compound gave him an appreciation for communal living that would influence his later political ideas.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=39}}\n\n===Schooling: 1934\u20131942===\n\nThe British colonial administration encouraged the education of chiefs' sons, believing that this would help to perpetuate the chieftain system and prevent the development of a separate educated indigenous elite who might challenge colonial governance.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=35}} At his father's prompting, Nyerere began his education at the [[Native Administration School]] in [[Mwisenge]], [[Musoma]] in February 1934, about 25 miles from his home.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=43|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=125|3a1=Molony|3y=2014|3pp=43, 46|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4p=29}} This placed him in a privileged position; most of his contemporaries at Butiama could not afford a primary education.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=45}} His education was in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], a language he had to learn while there.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=45|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=30}} Nyerere excelled at the school, and after six months his exam results were such that he [[Grade skipping|was allowed to skip a grade]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=46}} He avoided sporting activities and preferred to read in his dormitory during free time.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=47}}\n\nWhile at the school he also underwent the Zanaki tooth filing ritual to have his upper-front teeth sharpened into triangular points.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=42|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=52|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=28}} It may have been at this point that he took up smoking, a habit he retained for several decades.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=52}} He also began to take an interest in [[Roman Catholicism]], although was initially concerned about abandoning the veneration of his people's traditional gods.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=125}} With school friend Mang'ombe Marwa, Nyerere trekked 14 miles to the [[Nyegina Mission Centre]], run by the [[White Fathers]], to learn more about the Christian religion;

At a January 1958 conference in Tabora, Nyerere convinced TANU to take part.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=69|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=49}} In [[Tanganyikan general election, 1958\u201359|these elections]], which took place over the course of 1958 and 1959, TANU won every seat it contested.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=71}} Nyerere stood as TANU's candidate in the Eastern Province seat against an independent candidate, Patrick Kunambi, securing 2600 votes to Kunambi's 800.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=71}} Some of the European and Asian candidates elected were TANU sympathisers, ensuring that the council was dominated by the party.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=50}}\n\n===TANU in government: 1959\u20131961===\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-166-21.jpg|thumb|right|Nyerere campaigning for Tanganyikan independence in March 1961]]\n\nIn March 1959, the new British Governor of Tanganyika, [[Richard Turnbull (colonial governor)|Richard Turnbull]], gave TANU five of the twelve ministerial posts available in the colony's government.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=71}} Turnbull was prepared to work for a peaceful transition to independence.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=50}} In 1959, Nyerere visited Edinburgh.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=193}} In 1960, he attended a conference of independent African states in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia, at which he presented a paper calling for the formation of an [[East African Federation]]. He suggested that Tanganyika could delay its attainment of independence from the British Empire until neighbouring Kenya and Uganda were able to do the same. In his view, it would be much easier for the three countries to unite at the same point as independence than after it, for beyond that point their respective governments might feel that they were losing sovereignty through unification.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=72}} Many senior TANU members opposed the idea of delaying Tanganyikan independence;{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=72}} the party had been growing, and as of 1960 had over a million members.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=46}}\n\nIn the [[1960 Tanganyikan general election|August 1960 general election]], TANU won 70 of the 71 available seats.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=72}} As TANU's leader, Nyerere was called to form a new government;{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=72}} he became its chief minister.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=51}} That year, British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] gave his \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech, indicating British willingness to dismantle the empire in Africa.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=51}} In March 1961, a constitutional conference was held in Dar es Salaam to determine the nature of an independent constitution; both anti-colonial campaigners and British officials attended.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=72}} As a concession to the UK's colonial secretary [[Iain Macleod]], Nyerere agreed that after independence, Tanganyika would retain the British Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as its head of state for a year before becoming a republic.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=72}} In May, Tanganyika achieved self-governance.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=73}} One of Nyerere's first acts as Prime Minister was to stop the supply of Tanganyikan labourers to South African gold mines.

He expressed the hope that the government would never have to use it, and noted that they were aware how it \"could be a convenient tool in the hands of an unscrupulous government\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=87}}\n\nThe government drew up plans to create a new constitution which would convert Tanganyika from a monarchy with the British Queen as its head of state into a republic with an elected President as head of state.

In November 1964, Kambona publicly announced the discovery of evidence of a U.S.-Portuguese plot to invade Tanzania. The evidence\u2014which consisted of three photostat documents\u2014was labelled a forgery by the U.S. Embassy and after Nyerere returned from a week at [[Lake Manyara]] he acknowledged that this was a possibility.{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=139\u2013140}} After the U.S. launched [[Operation Dragon Rouge]] to retrieve white hostages held by rebels in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], Congo, Nyerere condemned them, expressing anger that they would go to such efforts to save 1000 white lives while doing nothing to prevent the subjugation of millions of black people in southern Africa.{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=140\u2013142}} He believed that the operation was designed to bolster the Congolese government of [[Moise Tshombe]], which Nyerere\u2014like many African nationalists\u2014despised.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=141}} Explaining this antipathy to Tshombe, he said: \"try to imagine a Jew who recruits ex-Nazis to go to Israel and assist him in his power struggle.

The first step was to convince farmers to move into a single village, with their crops planted nearby. The second was to establish communal plots where these farmers would experiment working collectively. The third was to establish a communal farm.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=173}} Nyerere had been inspired by the example of the [[Rumuva Development Association]] (RDA), an agricultural commune formed in 1962, and believed its example could be followed throughout Tanzania.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|pp=86\u201387}} By the end of 1970, there were reportedly a thousand villages in Tanzania referring to themselves as ujamaa.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=173}} The peasants brought into these new villages often lacked the self-reliant enthusiasm of the RDA members;{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|pp=88\u201389}} despite Nyerere's hopes, villagization rarely improved agricultural production.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=89}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The Arusha Declaration was a turning point in Tanzanian history and a widely influential speech in Africa.

The Tanzanian Parliament did not pass the bill into law, the first time that it had rejected legislation backed by Nyerere. The majority of parliamentarians argued that its granting of additional funds to said officials broke the spirit of the Arusha Declaration.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=194}} Nyerere decided not to push the issue, conceding that parliament had valid concerns.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=195}}\n\nAlthough the Arusha Declaration was domestically popular, some politicians spoke against it.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=82}} In October 1969 a group of army officers and former politicians, including former head of the National Women's Organisation [[Bibi Titi Mohammad]] and former Labour Minister [[Michael Kamaliza]], were arrested, accused of plotting to kill Nyerere and overthrow the government, convicted, and imprisoned.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=191}} In 1969, Nyerere made a state visit to Canada.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=146}} In 1969, Nyerere informed a journalist that he was contemplating retirement from the presidency, hoping to encourage new leadership, although at the same time had a desire to remain in place to oversee the implementation of his ideas.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=201}} In [[1970 Tanzanian general election|the 1970 election]], Nyerere again stood unopposed, securing 97% support for him to serve another five-year term.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=196}} Again, parliamentary elections took place on the mainland but not in Zanzibar.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=196}}\n\n===Economic crises with War with Uganda: 1971\u20131979===\n\n[[File:Bezoek president Nyerere van Tanzania president Nyerere spreekt in de Eerste Ka, Bestanddeelnr 933-2627.jpg|thumb|right|Nyerere on a visit to the Netherlands in 1985]]\n\nIn the early 1970s, Nyerere's government accelerated the \"[[villagization]]\" process.{{sfnm|1a1=Shivji|1y=2012|1p=110|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=89}} They hoped that doing so would improve agricultural productivity, allowing the country to export more and thus funding the development of light industry so that Tanzania would be able to produce more consumer goods and rely less on imports.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=89}} Increasingly, farmers who refused to join the communal villages were regarded as opponents of TANU.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=90}} Police began to round up farmers and forced them to move into the villages.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} 13 million people were eventually registered to 7000 villages.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} As a result, rural production was severely disrupted.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} According to a 1978 government survey, none of the villages had achieved the official targets for agricultural productivity.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} Many villages were left reliant on famine relief.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} In contrast to the government's intentions, food imports rose dramatically and inflation accelerated.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} Overall import levels tripled during the 1970s, while exports only doubled.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=106}} The entire process also damaged Nyerere's reputation with the rural population.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=110}}\n\nThe villagization process had greater success in ensuring wider public access to social services.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=92}} Nyerere's government pursued the rapid expansion of healthcare.

We appeal to all thinking Europeans and Indians to regard themselves as ordinary citizens of Tanganyika... We are all Tanganyikans and we are all east Africans.\"{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=144}} He argued that racial equality should be upheld on an individual basis, with individuals being legally protected against racial discrimination, rather than being enshrined in government with certain parliamentary seats reserved for different racial groups.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=66}} This involvement in multi-racial politics differed from the approaches adopted by many other African nationalists in Tanganyika.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=203}} When in power, Nyerere ensured that his government and close associates reflected a cross-section of East African society, including black Africans, Indians, Arabs, and Europeans, as well as practitioners of Christianity, [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[African traditional religion]].{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=11}}\n\nNyerere was also a Pan-Africanist.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=103}} He nevertheless saw a tension between his governance of a nation-state and his Pan-Africanist values, referring to this as \"dilemma of the pan-Africanist\" in a 1964 address.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=104}}\n\n===Democracy and the one-party state===\n\nNyerere emphasised the idea of [[democracy]] as a principle.{{sfnm|1a1=Pratt|1y=1976|1p=65|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=157}} He described democracy as \"government by the people...

But: a multiplicity of parties does not guarantee democracy\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=153}} For Nyerere, it was the preservation of political and civil liberties, rather than the presence of multiple parties, that ensured democracy;{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=68\u201369}} he believed that [[freedom of speech]] was possible in a one-party state.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=77\u201378}} However, his opposition to the formation of competing political groups led critics to argue both that there were anti-democratic implications to his thought.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=77}}\n\nNyerere was keen to associate himself with the idea of [[freedom]], titling his three major compilations of speeches and writings ''Freedom and Unity'', ''Freedom and Socialism'', and ''Freedom and Development''.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=156}} His conception of freedom was strongly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=156}} Like Kant, Nyerere believed that the purpose of the state was to promote liberty and the freedom of the individual.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===African socialism===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=At the heart and centre of Nyerere's political values was an affirmation of the fundamental equality of all humankind and a commitment to the building of social, economic and political institutions which would reflect and ensure this equality.|source=\u2014 Pratt, 2000{{sfn|Pratt|2000|p=366}} }}\n\nNyerere was a socialist,{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=63, 70}} with his views on socialism intertwined with his ideas on democracy.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=72}} He promoted \"[[African socialism]]\" from at least July 1943, when he wrote an article referring to the concept in the ''Tanganyika Standard'' newspaper.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=68}} Where he learned the term is not clear, for it would not become widely used until the 1960s.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=68}} Nyerere saw socialism not as an alien idea to Africa but as something that reflected traditional African lifestyles.

expressed the view that Marxist ideas about the construction of a socialist society from a capitalist one through the efforts of a revolutionary urban proletariat class were not applicable to

classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=169|2a1=Pratt|2y=1976|2p=77}} In most of Africa, Nyerere said, \"we have to begin our socialism from tribal communalism and a colonial legacy which did not build

A founding member of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) party\u2014which in 1977 became the [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] party\u2014he chaired it until 1990. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|African socialist]], he promoted a political philosophy known as [[Ujamaa]].\n\nBorn in [[Butiama]], then in the British colony of Tanganyika, Nyerere was the son of a [[Zanaki people|Zanaki]] chief. After completing his schooling, he studied at [[Makerere College]] in Uganda and then [[Edinburgh University]] in Scotland. In 1952 he returned to Tanganyika, married, and worked as a teacher. In 1954, he helped form TANU, through which he campaigned for Tanganyikan independence from the [[British Empire]]. Influenced by the [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]], Nyerere preached non-violent protest to achieve this aim. Elected to the Legislative Council in the [[1958\u201359 Tanganyikan general election|1958\u20131959 elections]], Nyerere then led TANU to victory at the [[1960 Tanganyikan general election|1960 general election]], becoming Prime Minister. Negotiations with the British authorities resulted in Tanganyikan independence in 1961. In 1962, Tanganyika became a republic, with Nyerere elected its first president. His administration pursued [[decolonisation]] and the \"Africanisation\" of the civil service while promoting unity between indigenous Africans and the country's Asian and European minorities. He encouraged the formation of a [[one-party state]] and unsuccessfully pursued the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] formation of an [[East African Federation]] with Uganda and Kenya. A 1963 mutiny within the army was suppressed with British assistance.\n\nFollowing the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of 1964, the island of [[Zanzibar]] was unified with Tanganyika to form Tanzania. After this, Nyerere placed a growing emphasis on national self-reliance and socialism. Although his socialism differed from that promoted by [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], Tanzania developed close links with [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China|Marxist\u2013governed China]]. In 1967, Nyerere issued the [[Arusha Declaration]] which outlined his vision of ujamaa. Banks and other major industries and companies were nationalised; education and healthcare were significantly expanded. Renewed emphasis was placed on agricultural development through the formation of communal farms, although these reforms hampered food production and left Tanzania dependent on foreign food aid. His government provided training and aid to anti-colonialist groups fighting white-minority rule throughout southern Africa and oversaw [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|Tanzania's 1978\u20131979 war with Uganda]] which resulted in the overthrow of Ugandan President [[Idi Amin]]. In 1985, Nyerere stood down and was succeeded by [[Ali Hassan Mwinyi]], who reversed many of Nyerere's policies. He remained chair of Chama Cha Mapinduzi until 1990, supporting a transition to a [[multi-party system]], and later served as mediator in attempts to end the [[Burundian Civil War]].\n\nNyerere was a controversial figure. Across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist and in power received praise for ensuring that, unlike many of its neighbours, Tanzania remained stable and unified in the decades following independence. His construction of the one-party state and use of [[detention without trial]] led to accusations of [[dictator]]ial governance, while he has also been blamed for economic mismanagement. He is held in deep respect within Tanzania, where he is often referred to by the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[honorific]] ''Mwalimu'' (\"teacher\") and described as the \"Father of the Nation\".\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1922\u20131934===\n\nJulius Kambarage Nyerere was born on 13 April 1922 in Mwitongo, an area of the village of [[Butiama]] in [[Tanganyika]]'s [[Mara Region]].{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1pp=11, 37\u201338|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2015|2p=24|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=27}}{{efn|Nyerere was not aware of his date of birth for much of his life; he claimed that he was born in February 1921 for at least his first twenty-five years. He discovered his actual date of birth in the late 1960s, when it was revealed that a local elder, Mtokambali Bukiri, had made a note of it in his medical records for the community.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=37\u201338}} }} He was one of 25 surviving children of Nyerere Burito, the chief of the [[Zanaki people]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=40|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=12}} Burito had been born in 1860 and given the name \"Nyerere\" (\"[[caterpillar]]\" in Zanaki) after a plague of worm caterpillars infested the local area at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=32}} Burito had been appointed chief in 1915, installed in that position by the German imperial administrators of what was then [[German East Africa]];{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=32}} his position was also endorsed by the incoming British imperial administration.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=33}} Burito had 22 wives, of whom Julius' mother, Mugaya Nyang'ombe, was the fifth.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=13, 34}} She had been born in 1892 and had married the chief in 1907, when she was fifteen.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1p=34|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=27}} Mugaya bore Burito four sons and four daughters, of which Nyerere was the second child; two of his siblings died in infancy.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=40}}\n\nThese wives lived in various huts around Burito's cattle corral, in the centre of which was his roundhouse.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=13}} The Zanaki were one of the smallest of the 120 tribes in the British colony and were then sub-divided among eight [[chiefdom]]s; they would only be united under the kingship of Chief [[Wanzagi Nyerere]], Burito's half-brother, in the 1960s.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=125}} Nyerere's clan were the Abhakibhweege.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=12}} At birth, Nyerere was given the personal name \"Mugendi\" (\"Walker\" in Zanaki) but this was soon changed to \"Kambarage\", the name of a female rain spirit, at the advice of a ''omugabhu'' [[divination|diviner]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=38}} Nyerere was raised into the [[polytheism|polytheistic]] belief system of the Zanaki,{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=16\u201317}} and lived at his mother's house, assisting in the farming of the millet, maize and cassava.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=38}} With other local boys he also took part in the herding of goats and cattle.{{sfnm|1a1=Assensoh|1y=1998|1p=125|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=39|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=28}} At some point he underwent the Zanaki's traditional [[circumcision]] ritual at [[Gabizuryo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1p=38|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=28}} As the son of a chief he was exposed to African-administered power and authority,{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=41}} and living in the compound gave him an appreciation for communal living that would influence his later political ideas.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=39}}\n\n===Schooling: 1934\u20131942===\n\nThe British colonial administration encouraged the education of chiefs' sons, believing that this would help to perpetuate the chieftain system and prevent the development of a separate educated indigenous elite who might challenge colonial governance.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=35}} At his father's prompting, Nyerere began his education at the [[Native Administration School]] in [[Mwisenge]], [[Musoma]] in February 1934, about 25 miles from his home.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=43|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=125|3a1=Molony|3y=2014|3pp=43, 46|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4p=29}} This placed him in a privileged position; most of his contemporaries at Butiama could not afford a primary education.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=45}} His education was in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], a language he had to learn while there.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=45|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=30}} Nyerere excelled at the school, and after six months his exam results were such that he [[Grade skipping|was allowed to skip a grade]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=46}} He avoided sporting activities and preferred to read in his dormitory during free time.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=47}}\n\nWhile at the school he also underwent the Zanaki tooth filing ritual to have his upper-front teeth sharpened into triangular points.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=42|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=52|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=28}} It may have been at this point that he took up smoking, a habit he retained for several decades.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=52}} He also began to take an interest in [[Roman Catholicism]], although was initially concerned about abandoning the veneration of his people's traditional gods.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=125}} With school friend Mang'ombe Marwa, Nyerere trekked 14 miles to the [[Nyegina Mission Centre]], run by the [[White Fathers]], to learn more about the Christian religion; although Marwa eventually stopped, Nyerere continued.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1pp=48, 50|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=30}} His elementary schooling ended in 1936; his final exam results were the highest of any pupil in the [[Lake Province and Western Province]] region.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=53}}\n\nHis academic excellence allowed him to gain a government scholarship to attend the elite [[Tabora Government School]], a secondary school in [[Tabora]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=45|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=125|3a1=Molony|3y=2014|3p=53|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4p=31}} There, he again avoided sporting activities but helped to set up a [[Boy Scout]]'s brigade after reading ''[[Scouting for Boys]]''.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=54\u201356}} Fellow pupils later remembered him as being ambitious and competitive, eager to come top of the class in examinations.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2pp=125\u2013126}} He used books in the school library to advance his knowledge of the [[English language]] to a high standard.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=57}} He was heavily involved in the school's [[debating society]],{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=46|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=59|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=31}} and teachers recommended him as head prefect, but this was vetoed by the headmaster, who described Nyerere as being \"too kind\" for the position.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=46|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=57}} In keeping with Zanaki custom, Nyerere entered into an [[arranged marriage]] with a girl named Magori Watiha, who was then only three or four years old but had been selected for him by his father. At the time they continued to live apart.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1pp=82\u201383|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=31}} In March 1942, during Nyerere's final year at Tabora, his father died; the school refused his request to return home for the funeral.{{sfnm|1a1=Assensoh|1y=1998|1p=125|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2pp=13, 59|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=32}} Nyerere's brother, [[Edward Wanzagi Nyerere]], was appointed as their father's successor.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=36}} Nyerere then decided to be baptised as a Roman Catholic;{{sfnm|1a1=Assensoh|1y=1998|1p=125|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2pp=62\u201363|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2015|3p=25|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4p=32}} at his baptism, he took on the name \"Julius\",{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=40|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=63|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2015|3p=25|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4p=32}} although later stated that it was \"silly\" that Catholics should \"take a name other than a tribal name\" on baptism.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=45}}\n\n===Makerere College, Uganda: 1943\u20131947===\n\n[[File:Ssetendekero Makerere.jpg|thumb|right|The main building at Makere University in Uganda, where Nyerere studied a teacher training course]]\n\nIn October 1942, Nyerere completed his secondary education and decided to study at [[Makerere College]] in the Ugandan city of [[Kampala]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=461|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=126|3a1=Molony|3y=2014|3p=61|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4p=32}} He secured a bursary to fund a teacher training course there,{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=63}} arriving in Uganda in January 1943.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=64}} At Makerere, he studied alongside many of East Africa's most talented students,{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=65\u201366}} although spent little time socialising with others, instead focusing on his reading.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=66}} He took courses in chemistry, biology, Latin, and Greek.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=75}} Deepening his Catholicism, he studied the [[Papal Encyclicals]] and read the work of Catholic philosophers like [[Jacques Maritain]];{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=75}} most influential however were the writings of the liberal British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=46|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=126|3a1=Molony|3y=2014|3p=73|4a1=Bjerk|4y=2017|4pp=32\u201333}} He won a literary competition with an essay on the subjugation of women, for which he had applied Mill's ideas to Zanaki society.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1p=73|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=33}} Nyerere was also an active member of the Makere Debating Society,{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=66}} and established a branch of [[Catholic Action]] at the university.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=75}}\n\nIn July 1943, he wrote a letter to the ''[[Tanganyika Standard]]'' in which he discussed the ongoing [[Second World War]] and argued that [[capitalism]] was alien to Africa and that the continent should turn to \"African socialism\"; in his words, \"the African is by nature a socialistic being\".{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1pp=68\u201369|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=33}} His letter went on to state that \"the educated African should take the lead\" in moving the population towards a more explicitly socialist model.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=72}} Molony thought that the letter \"serves to mark the beginnings of Nyerere's political maturation, chiefly in absorbing and developing the views of leading black thinkers of the time.\"{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=72}} In 1943, Nyerere, [[Andrew Tibandebage]], and [[Hamza Kibwana Bakari Mwapachu]] founded the Tanganyika African Welfare Association (TAWA) to assist the small number of Tanganyikan students at Makerere.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2014|1p=76|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=32}} TAWA was allowed to die off, and in its place Nyerere revived the largely moribund Makerere chapter of the [[Tanganyika African Association]] (TAA), although this too had ceased functioning by 1947.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=46|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2pp=76\u201377|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=32}} Although aware of racial prejudice from the white colonial minority, he insisted on treating people as individuals, recognising that many white individuals were not bigoted towards indigenous Africans.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=66\u201367}} After three years, Nyerere graduated from Makerere with a diploma in education.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=47|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Early teaching: 1947\u20131949===\n\nOn leaving Makerere, Nyerere returned home to Zanaki territory to build a house for his widowed mother, before spending his time reading and farming in Butiama.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=47|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=79}} He was offered teaching positions at both the state-run Tabora Boys' School and the mission-run St Mary's, but chose the latter despite it offering a lower wage.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=47|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2pp=79\u201380|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=33}} He took part in a public debate with two teachers from the Tabora Boys' School, in which he argued against the statement that \"The African has benefitted more than the European since the partition of Africa\";

During the anti-colonial struggle, only indigenous Africans had been permitted to join, but Nyerere now stated that it should welcome white and Asian members.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=85|2a1=Neve|2y=1976|2p=38}} He also stipulated that \"complete political amnesty\" should be granted to anyone expelled from the party since 1954, allowing them to rejoin.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=85}} In early 1963, [[Amir Jamal]], an Asian Tanganyikan, became the party's first non-indigenous member; the white [[Derek Bryceson]] became its second.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=85}} Nyerere welcomed Asians and Europeans into the cabinet to counter potential racial resentment from these minorities.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=56}} Nyerere saw it as importance to build a \"national consciousness\" that transcended ethnic and religious lines.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=53}}\n\n===Presidency of Tanganyika: 1962\u20131964===\n[[File:JFKWHP-AR6696-A.jpg|thumb|right|President Nyerere and U.S. President John F.

Instead, Nyerere stressed the idea of forming regional confederations as short-term steps towards the eventual unification of the continent.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=158}} Pursuing these ideals, in June 1963 Nyerere met with Kenyan President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in Nairobi, where they agreed to unite their respective countries into a single [[East African Federation]] by the end of the year. This, however, never materialised.{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=88\u201389}} In December 1963, Nyerere lamented that this failure was the major disappointment of the year.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=89}} Instead, the [[East African Community]] was launched in 1967, to facilitate some cooperation between the three countries.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=97}} Later, Nyerere saw his inability to establish an East African Federation as the biggest failure of his career.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2006|p=15}}\n\nNyerere was concerned by developments in [[Zanzibar]], a pair of islands off of Tanganyika's coast. He noted that it was \"very vulnerable to outside influences\", which could in turn impact Tanganyika.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=90}} Nyerere was keen to keep [[Cold War]] conflicts between the U.S. and [[Soviet Union]] out of eastern Africa.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=70}} Zanzibar secured independence from the British Empire in 1963,{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=91}} and in January 1964 the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] took place, in which the Arab Sultan [[Jamshid bin Abdullah of Zanzibar|Jamshid bin Abdullah]] was overthrown and replaced by a government consisting largely of indigenous Africans.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1pp=97\u201398|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=65}} Nyerere was taken by surprise by the revolution.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=102}} Like Kenya and Uganda, he quickly recognised the new government, although allowed the deposed Sultan to land in Tanganyika and from there fly to London.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=102}} At the request of the new Zanzibar government, he sent 300 policemen to the island to help restore order.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=100|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=66}}\n\n====Facing mutiny====\n\nIn January 1964, Nyerere ended affirmative action hiring for the civil service.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=89|2a1=Neve|2y=1976|2p=38|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=64}} Believing the colonial imbalance to have been redressed, he stated: \"it would be wrong for us to continue to distinguish between Tanganyikan citizens on any grounds other than those of character and ability to do specific tasks\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=89}} Many trade unionists denounced the discontinuation of the policy and it proved the catalyst for an army mutiny.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=89|2a1=Neve|2y=1976|2p=38|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3pp=64\u201366}} On 20 January, a small group of soldiers in the First Battalion calling themselves the Army Night Freedom Fighters launched an uprising, demanding the dismissal of their white officers and a pay rise.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1pp=109\u2013112|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=66}} The mutineers left the [[Colito Barracks]] and entered Dar es Salaam, where they seized the State House.

You could never consider it an army of the people.\"{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=119\u2013120}} Acknowledging some of the mutineers demands, he appointed Sarakikya as the new commander of the army and raised troop wages.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=119}} After the mutiny, Nyerere's government became increasingly focused on security, placing TANU personnel into the army as well as state-owned industry to entrench party control throughout the country.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=73}}\n\n==Presidency of Tanzania==\n\n===Unification with Zanzibar: 1964===\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-164-60.jpg|thumb|right|Nyerere in a public procession]]\n\nFollowing the Zanzibari Revolution, [[Abeid Karume]] declared himself President of a one-party state and began redistributing Arab-owned land among black African peasants.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=122}} Hundreds of Arabs and Indians left, as did most of the island's British community.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=122}} Western powers were reluctant to recognise Karume's government, whereas the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, and People's Republic of China quickly did so and offered the country aid.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=124}} Nyerere was angry at this Western response as well as the wider Western failure to appreciate why black Zanzibaris had revolted in the first place.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=125}}\n\nIn April he visited Karume; the following day they announced the political unification of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=126}} Nyerere dismissed suggestions that this had anything to do with Cold War power struggles, presenting it as a response to Pan-Africanist ideology: \"Unity in our continent does not have to come via Moscow or Washington.\"{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=127}} Later biographer William Edgett Smith however suggested that a key reason for Nyerere's desire for unification was to prevent Zanzibar falling into a Cold War proxy conflict akin to those then raging in Congo and Vietnam.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=128}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-164-10.jpg|thumb|left|Nyerere meeting with visitors from the [[United Nations]]]]\n\nAn interim constitution for the \"United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar\" presented Nyerere as the country's president, with Karume as its first vice president and [[Rashidi Kawawa]] as its second vice president.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=127|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2pp=69\u201370}} In August, the government launched a competition to find a new name for the country; two months later it announced that the winning proposal was \"United Republic of Tanzania\".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=130|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=70}} There was no immediate change to the structure of the Zanzibari government; Karume and his Revolutionary Council remained in charge,{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=130\u2013131}} and there was no merging of TANU and the Afro-Shirazi Party.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=131}} There would be no local or parliamentary elections on the island for many years.{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=131\u2013132}} Zanzibaris made up only 350,000 out of Tanzania's total population of 13 million, although from 1967 they were given seven of the 22 cabinet positions and directly appointed 40 of the country's 183 members of parliament.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=132}} Nyerere explained this disproportionately high representation by stressing the need for sensitivity to the islanders' national pride; in 1965, he stated that \"The Zanzibaris are a proud people. No one has ever intended that they should become simply the Republic's eighteenth region.\"{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=132}}\n\nKarume was erratic and unpredictable.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=136}} He was a source of repeated embarrassment to Nyerere, who tolerated him for the sake of Tanzanian unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=134|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=98}} In one instance in August 1969, Zanzibari authorities arrested 14 men whom they accused of plotting a coup.

There, he presented its Committee with a new statement of party principles: the [[Arusha Declaration]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=170|2a1=Pratt|2y=1976|2p=4|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=81}} This declaration affirmed the government's commitment to building a democratic socialist state and stressed the development of an ethos of self-reliance.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=170}} In Nyerere's view, true independence was not possible while the country remained dependent on gifts and loans from other nations.{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=170\u2013171}} It stipulated that renewed emphasis should be placed on developing the peasant agricultural economy to ensure greater self-sufficiency, even if this meant slower economic growth.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=171}} After this point, the concept of socialism became central to the government's policy formation.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=5}} To promote the Arusha Declaration, groups of TANU supporters marched through the countryside to raise awareness; in October, Nyerere accompanied one such eight-day march which covered 138 miles in his native Mara district.{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=176\u2013181}}\n\nThe day after the declaration, the government announced the nationalisation of all Tanzanian banks, with compensation provided to their owners.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=171|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=85}} Over the following days, it announced plans to nationalise various insurance companies, import-export firms, mills, and sisal estates, as well as the purchase of majority interest in seven other firms, including those producing cement, cigarettes, beer, and shoes.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=171}} Some foreign specialists were employed to run these nationalised industries until sufficient numbers of Tanzanians had been trained to take over;{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=172}} the country's civil service nevertheless had little experience with economic planning,{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=85}} and eventually foreign companies had to be brought in to administer several nationalised industries.{{sfn|Pratt|2000|p=371}} A year after these initial nationalisations, Nyerere praised the Tanzanian Asians for their role in ensuring the successful running of the nationalised banks, stating: \"these people deserve the gratitude of our country\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=172}}\n\nNyerere followed his declaration with a series of additional policy papers covering such areas as foreign policy and rural development.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=4}} \"Education for Self-Reliance\" stressed that schools should place a new emphasis on teaching agricultural skills.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=173}} Another, \"Socialism and Rural Development\", outlined a three step process for creating ''ujamaa'' co-operative villages. The first step was to convince farmers to move into a single village, with their crops planted nearby. The second was to establish communal plots where these farmers would experiment working collectively. The third was to establish a communal farm.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=173}} Nyerere had been inspired by the example of the [[Rumuva Development Association]] (RDA), an agricultural commune formed in 1962, and believed its example could be followed throughout Tanzania.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|pp=86\u201387}} By the end of 1970, there were reportedly a thousand villages in Tanzania referring to themselves as ujamaa.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=173}} The peasants brought into these new villages often lacked the self-reliant enthusiasm of the RDA members;{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|pp=88\u201389}} despite Nyerere's hopes, villagization rarely improved agricultural production.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=89}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The Arusha Declaration was a turning point in Tanzanian history and a widely influential speech in Africa.

The Tanzanian Parliament did not pass the bill into law, the first time that it had rejected legislation backed by Nyerere. The majority of parliamentarians argued that its granting of additional funds to said officials broke the spirit of the Arusha Declaration.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=194}} Nyerere decided not to push the issue, conceding that parliament had valid concerns.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=195}}\n\nAlthough the Arusha Declaration was domestically popular, some politicians spoke against it.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=82}} In October 1969 a group of army officers and former politicians, including former head of the National Women's Organisation [[Bibi Titi Mohammad]] and former Labour Minister [[Michael Kamaliza]], were arrested, accused of plotting to kill Nyerere and overthrow the government, convicted, and imprisoned.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=191}} In 1969, Nyerere made a state visit to Canada.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=146}} In 1969, Nyerere informed a journalist that he was contemplating retirement from the presidency, hoping to encourage new leadership, although at the same time had a desire to remain in place to oversee the implementation of his ideas.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=201}} In [[1970 Tanzanian general election|the 1970 election]], Nyerere again stood unopposed, securing 97% support for him to serve another five-year term.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=196}} Again, parliamentary elections took place on the mainland but not in Zanzibar.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=196}}\n\n===Economic crises with War with Uganda: 1971\u20131979===\n\n[[File:Bezoek president Nyerere van Tanzania president Nyerere spreekt in de Eerste Ka, Bestanddeelnr 933-2627.jpg|thumb|right|Nyerere on a visit to the Netherlands in 1985]]\n\nIn the early 1970s, Nyerere's government accelerated the \"[[villagization]]\" process.{{sfnm|1a1=Shivji|1y=2012|1p=110|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=89}} They hoped that doing so would improve agricultural productivity, allowing the country to export more and thus funding the development of light industry so that Tanzania would be able to produce more consumer goods and rely less on imports.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=89}} Increasingly, farmers who refused to join the communal villages were regarded as opponents of TANU.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=90}} Police began to round up farmers and forced them to move into the villages.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} 13 million people were eventually registered to 7000 villages.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} As a result, rural production was severely disrupted.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} According to a 1978 government survey, none of the villages had achieved the official targets for agricultural productivity.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} Many villages were left reliant on famine relief.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} In contrast to the government's intentions, food imports rose dramatically and inflation accelerated.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=91}} Overall import levels tripled during the 1970s, while exports only doubled.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=106}} The entire process also damaged Nyerere's reputation with the rural population.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=110}}\n\nThe villagization process had greater success in ensuring wider public access to social services.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=92}} Nyerere's government pursued the rapid expansion of healthcare.

Shivji noted that although Nyerere was \"a great man of principle\" but that when in power, \"at times pragmatism, even Machiavellism, overshadowed his avowed principles\". As a result, Shivji argued, Nyerere exhibited \"a great ability and talent to rationalise his political actions with an astute exposition of principles\".{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=103}}\n\n===Anti-colonialism, non-racialism, and Pan-Africanism===\n\n[[File:10 tz shillings back.jpg|thumb|right|10 tz shillings back.]]\n\nNyerere was an African nationalist.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=103}} He despised colonialism,{{sfnm|1a1=Shivji|1y=2012|1p=103|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=202}} and felt duty bound to oppose the colonial state in Tanganyika.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=202}} In campaigning against colonialism, Nyerere acknowledged that he was inspired by the principles behind both the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=154}} He was also influenced by the Indian independence movement, which successfully resulted in the creation of an Indian republic in 1947, just before Nyerere studied in Britain.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=156}} Nyerere insisted that the situation in Tanganyika was such that non-violent protest was possible and should be pursued,{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=32}} stating: \"I'm non-violent in the sense of Mohandas Gandhi... I feel violence is an evil with which one cannot become associated unless it is absolutely necessary\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=32}} After becoming leader of his county, he became a prominent supporter of anti-colonial movements in southern Africa, providing said groups with material, diplomatic, and moral support.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2006|p=20}}\n\nAlthough opposing European colonialism, Nyerere was not antagonistic towards white Europeans; from his experiences he was aware that they were not all colonialists and racists.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=202}} Prior to independence he insisted on a non-racialist front against colonialism,{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=32}} challenging those African nationalists who wanted to deny equal rights to East Africa's European and Asian minorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Pratt|1y=1976|1p=64|2a1=Pratt|2y=2000|2p=367}} In a 1951 essay written in Edinburgh, he proposed that \"We must build up a society in which we shall belong to east Africa and not to our racial groups ... We appeal to all thinking Europeans and Indians to regard themselves as ordinary citizens of Tanganyika... We are all Tanganyikans and we are all east Africans.\"{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=144}} He argued that racial equality should be upheld on an individual basis, with individuals being legally protected against racial discrimination, rather than being enshrined in government with certain parliamentary seats reserved for different racial groups.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=66}} This involvement in multi-racial politics differed from the approaches adopted by many other African nationalists in Tanganyika.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=203}} When in power, Nyerere ensured that his government and close associates reflected a cross-section of East African society, including black Africans, Indians, Arabs, and Europeans, as well as practitioners of Christianity, [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[African traditional religion]].{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=11}}\n\nNyerere was also a Pan-Africanist.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=103}} He nevertheless saw a tension between his governance of a nation-state and his Pan-Africanist values, referring to this as \"dilemma of the pan-Africanist\" in a 1964 address.{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=104}}\n\n===Democracy and the one-party state===\n\nNyerere emphasised the idea of [[democracy]] as a principle.{{sfnm|1a1=Pratt|1y=1976|1p=65|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=157}} He described democracy as \"government by the people... Ideally, it is a form of government whereby the people \u2013 all the people \u2013 settle their affairs through free discussion.\"{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=157\u2013158}} This is a definition close to that generated by the clergyman [[Theodore Parker]], whose influence he acknowledged.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=158}} It was also influenced by forms of localised decision making found in various indigenous African societies,{{sfn|Neve|1976|p=41}} with Nyerere stating that discussing an issue till everyone agreed was \"the very essence of traditional African democracy\".{{sfn|Neve|1976|p=41}} He absorbed the values of [[liberal democracy]] but focused attention on how to \"Africanize\" democracy.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=67}} He emphasized that post-colonial African states were in a very different situation to Western countries and thus required a different governance structure;{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=67\u201368}} specifically, he favoured a representative democratic system within a one-party state.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=158}} He opposed the formation of different parties and other political organisations with differing objectives in Tanzania, deeming them disruptive to his idea of the harmonious society and fearing their ability to further destabilise the fragile state.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nHe criticised the ''de facto'' [[two-party system]] he had observed in Britain, describing it as \"foot-ball politics\".{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=125\u2013126}} In his words, \"where there is ''one'' party, and that party is identified with the ''nation as a whole'', the foundations of democracy are firmer than they can ever be when you have two or more parties, each representing only a section of the community!\"{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=125}} He repeatedly wrote arguments on these ideas, often aimed at Western liberals.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=66\u201367}} Following the 1965 parliamentary election, in which different candidates from the same party competed for most seats, Nyerere noted: \"I don't blame Westerners for being sceptical. The only democracies they have known have been multi-party systems, and the only one-party systems they have seen have been non-democratic. But: a multiplicity of parties does not guarantee democracy\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=153}} For Nyerere, it was the preservation of political and civil liberties, rather than the presence of multiple parties, that ensured democracy;{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=68\u201369}} he believed that [[freedom of speech]] was possible in a one-party state.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=77\u201378}} However, his opposition to the formation of competing political groups led critics to argue both that there were anti-democratic implications to his thought.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=77}}\n\nNyerere was keen to associate himself with the idea of [[freedom]], titling his three major compilations of speeches and writings ''Freedom and Unity'', ''Freedom and Socialism'', and ''Freedom and Development''.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=156}} His conception of freedom was strongly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=156}} Like Kant, Nyerere believed that the purpose of the state was to promote liberty and the freedom of the individual.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===African socialism===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=At the heart and centre of Nyerere's political values was an affirmation of the fundamental equality of all humankind and a commitment to the building of social, economic and political institutions which would reflect and ensure this equality.|source=\u2014 Pratt, 2000{{sfn|Pratt|2000|p=366}} }}\n\nNyerere was a socialist,{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=63, 70}} with his views on socialism intertwined with his ideas on democracy.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=72}} He promoted \"[[African socialism]]\" from at least July 1943, when he wrote an article referring to the concept in the ''Tanganyika Standard'' newspaper.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=68}} Where he learned the term is not clear, for it would not become widely used until the 1960s.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=68}} Nyerere saw socialism not as an alien idea to Africa but as something that reflected traditional African lifestyles. In his view, a \"socialist attitude of mind\" was already present in traditional African society.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=71}} In his words from 1962, \"We, in Africa, have no more need of being \"converted\" to socialism than we have of being \"taught\" democracy. Both are rooted in our past \u2013 in the traditional society which produced us.\"{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=70}} He presented the traditional African village\u2014as well as the ancient Greek city state\u2014as the model for the idealised society.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|pp=73\u201374}} Molony described Nyerere as having produced \"romanticised accounts of idyllic village life in 'traditional society'\", describing his as \"a misty-eyed view\" of this African past.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=70}}\n\nNyerere's ideas about socialism owed little to either European [[social democracy]] or [[Marxism]];{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=71}} he detested the Marxist idea of [[class struggle]].{{sfn|Shivji|2012|p=108}} Although he quoted from [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'' when speaking to certain audiences, he was critical of the idea of \"[[scientific socialism]]\" promoted by Marxists like Marx and [[Vladimir Lenin]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=151}} He expressed the view that Marxist ideas about the construction of a socialist society from a capitalist one through the efforts of a revolutionary urban proletariat class were not applicable to post-colonial Africa, where there was little or no capitalism or proletariat and where\u2014in Nyerere's view\u2014traditional society was not stratified into competing economic classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=169|2a1=Pratt|2y=1976|2p=77}} In most of Africa, Nyerere said, \"we have to begin our socialism from tribal communalism and a colonial legacy which did not build much capitalism\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} He was also critical of the \"[[utopian socialism]]\" promoted by figures like [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Robert Owen]], seeing their ideas as largely irrelevant to the Tanzanian situation.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=151}} In his view, these European socialist writers had not produced ideas suited to the African context because they had not considered the history of \"colonial domination\" which Africa had experienced.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=152}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The only way to defeat our present poverty is to accept the fact

''ujamaa'' must come from the individual's commitment to a just society in which all talents and abilities were used to the full.{{sfn|Huddleston|1995|p=6}} He desired a society in which the interests of the individual and society were identical and thought this could be achieved because individuals ultimately wanted to promote the common good.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=72}} He believed it important to balance the rights of the individual with their duty to society, expressing the view that Western countries placed too much of an emphasis on individual rights;{{sfn|Smith|1973|pp=21\u201322}} he regarded what he saw as the ensuing self-centred materialism as repulsive.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=76}} To determine what balance to strike between the freedom of the individual and their responsibilities to society, he turned to the ideas of Genevan philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=154\u2013155}} His ideas on societal collectivity may also have been influenced by the work of the social anthropologist Ralph Piddington, under whom Nyerere studied at Edinburgh.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=163\u2013164}} It was Nyerere's belief that Africa would resolve the tension between the individual and society, a balance which other continents had failed to achieve.{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=73}}\n\nNyerere detested elitism and sought to reflect that attitude in the manner in which he conducted himself as president.{{sfn|Huddleston|1995|p=2}} He was cautious to prevent the replacement of the colonial elite with an indigenous elite,{{sfn|Pratt|1976|p=65}} and to this end insisted that the most educated sectors of the Tanzanian population should remain fully integrated with society as a whole.{{sfn|Pratt|2000|pp=367\u2013368}} He criticised the existence of [[aristocracy]] and the British monarchy.{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=153\u2013154}} He endorsed the equality of the sexes, stating that \"it is essential that our women live on terms of full equality with their fellow citizens who are men\".{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=74}}\n\nHe remained dedicated to a belief in the [[rule of law]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=113}} He stressed the need for hard work.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=172}} Nyerere appealed to the idea of tradition when trying to convince Tanzanians of his ideas.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=148}} He stated that Tanzania could only be developed \"through the religion of socialism and

I think he is a good man.\"{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=68}}\nMolony suggested that there was \"a very shrewd side to his character\", in that he was capable of playing to his audience by portraying himself as \"the betrayed righteous figure, employing melodrama and even extortion to get what he wanted\".{{sfn|Molony|2014|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\nThe style of suit that Nyerere wore was widely imitated in Tanzania, which led to it being known as a \"Tanzanian suit\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=13}} Many European and American observers believed it similar to a [[Mao suit]] and interpreted it as evidence for Nyerere's perceived desire for greater links with the Marxist\u2013Leninist government in China.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=13}} Nyerere objected to the tendency in Western countries to view Africa through the prism of Cold War politics.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=168}}\nAfter the formation of Tanzania, Nyerere took to wearing a style of Zanzibaran hat called a ''[[Kofia (hat)|kofia]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=13}} In later life, he carried a small ebony stick known as a ''[[fimbo]]'' which served as a symbol of his authority.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=128}}\n\nNyerere published widely over the course of his life.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=24}} He wrote poetry,{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=33}} and translated [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' into Swahili, publishing these in 1961 and 1972 respectively.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=33|2a1=Molony|2y=2014|2p=111|3a1=Bjerk|3y=2017|3p=60}} In later life, he\u2014like many other Anglophone African statesmen\u2014was known to be an avid listener of the [[BBC World Service]] broadcasts.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=123}} According to Smith, Nyerere had \"a great fondness for British character and eccentricity\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=149}}\n\nRaised as a practitioner of Zanaki traditional religion, Nyerere formally converted to Roman Catholicism at the age of 20 and remained a practitioner throughout his life.{{sfn|Neve|1976|p=1}} Christianity strongly influenced Nyerere's life and his political beliefs.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=173}} Nyerere described Christianity as \"a revolutionary creed\" but believed that its message had often been corrupted by churches.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=22}} He liked to attend [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] in the early mornings,{{sfn|Huddleston|1995|p=6}} and while in Edinburgh enjoyed spending time sitting quietly in church.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=175}} There is some evidence that while in Scotland, he considered ordination as a Roman Catholic priest.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=176}} He avoided Christian sectarianism and was friends with Christians of other denominations.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=174}} Into his later life, he regularly attended mass.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=127}}\n\nWith his wife Maria Gabriel, Nyerere had seven children.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1973|1p=26|2a1=Bjerk|2y=2017|2p=103}} When Nyerere was president, he insisted that his children go to state school and receive no special privileges.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=103}} Two of his children suffered from mental illness.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=104}} During the 1970s, Nyerere's relationship with his wife became strained and she moved to live with her sister, near to the Kenyan border, for a while.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=104}} He had 26 grandchildren.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=129}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Nyerere had] a legacy which continues to inspire millions of people in Tanzania and elsewhere especially in other parts of Africa.

O. Maloba, through his writing Nyerere became \"one of the most respected contributors to the expanding literature on African Socialism\".{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=79}} Smith noted that through his regular tours of Tanzania, Nyerere \"has probably spoken directly to as large a percentage of his countrymen as any head of state on earth\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=193}} In Pratt's view, Nyerere had been \"a leader of unquestionable integrity who whatever his policy errors, was profoundly committed\" to the welfare of his people.{{sfn|Pratt|2000|p=366}} Bjerk characterised him as being \"neither saint nor tyrant, Nyerere was a politician who kept his integrity and vision in a harsh and changing world.\"{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=9}} Bjerk added that Nyerere was \"a brilliant intellectual, but some of his policies seem disastrously misguided to us today [2017].\"{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=10}} Bjerk noted that \"Nyerere stabilized his government and kept the country at peace\", something not achieved by most of Tanzania's neighbours.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=64}}\n\nRichard Turnbull, the last British Governor of Tanganyika, described Nyerere as having \"a tremendous adherence to principle\" and exhibiting \"rather a Gandhian streak\".{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=30}} The scholar of education J. Roger Carter noted that Nyerere's peaceful withdrawal from the leadership \"suggests a leader of unusual quality and a national spirit, largely of his own creation, of some maturity\".{{sfn|Carter|1995|p=vii}} The Russian historian Nikolai Kosukhin described Nyerere as a leader of a \"charismatic type, symbolizing the ideals and expectations of the people\", in this manner comparing him to Gandhi, Nkrumah, [[Sun Yat Sen]], and Senghor.{{sfn|Kosukhin|2005|p=6}} For Kosukhin, Nyerere was \"a recognized standard bearer of the struggle for African liberation and a tireless champion of the idea of equitable economic relations between the rich North and the developing South\".{{sfn|Kosukhin|2005|p=12}} In this way, Kosukhin thought, Nyerere \"belongs not only to Tanzania and Africa, but also to all mankind\".{{sfn|Kosukhin|2005|p=13}} In Mwakikagile's view, Nyerere \"epitomized the best\" among \"the founding fathers\" of independence African states, citing him alongside such \"Big Men\" as Kenyatta, Nkrumah, Sekou Toure, [[Patrice Lumumba]], and [[Modibo Keita]].{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2006|p=13}}\n\n[[File:Nyerere Square in Dodoma.jpg|thumb|left|A statue stands in the centre of Nyerere Square in Dodoma, Tanzania]]\n\nBureaucrats from TANU subsequently established a [[cult of personality]] around Nyerere.{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=2}} By the time he died, he was increasingly viewed as a symbol of the nation.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=127}} A museum and mausoleum devoted to him were built in Butiama.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=129}}\nPosthumously, the [[Catholic Church in Tanzania]] began the processing of beatifying Nyerere, hoping to have him recognised as a [[saint]].{{sfn|Molony|2014|p=2}} A delegation from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] arrived in Tanzania to investigate these calls in January 2006.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=9}} Although his ujamaa ideals were largely abandoned by the governments that succeeded him, the historian Sidney J. Lemelle argued that these values could be identified in the later Tanzanian [[hip hop]] and [[Rap music|rap]] scene.{{sfn|Lemelle|2006|p=230}}\n\nAt his death, Western commentators repeatedly claimed that Nyerere had served his people poorly as president.{{sfn|Pratt|2000|pp=365\u2013366}} Many Western governments and economists used Nyerere's Tanzania as an example of why, to ensure economic growth, post-colonial African states should embrace limited state regulation and a market economy linked in with the international capitalist economy.{{sfn|Pratt|2000|p=372}} Bjerk noted that although Nyerere was \"an advocate for democracy\", his pursuit of a democracy adapted to East African society led to him forming \"a one-party state that regularly violated democratic values\".{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=9}} He thought that \"few would deny\" that Nyerere \"became a dictator\", although noted that \"he maintained his authority without mass violence\", unlike many other dictatorial leaders in Africa.{{sfn|Bjerk|2017|p=99}} In 2007, the politician [[Ismail Jussa]] said of Nyerere: \"He wanted to preserve power.
